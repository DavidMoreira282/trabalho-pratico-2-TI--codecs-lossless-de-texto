In the begi2ning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkne2s was upon the face of the d2ep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. 
And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 
And God saw the light, that it was g2od: and God divided the light from the darkne2s. 
And God ca2led the light Day, and the darkne2s he ca2led Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. 
And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. 
And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. 
And God ca2led the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. 
And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land a2pear: and it was so. 
And God ca2led the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters ca2led he Seas: and God saw that it was g2od. 
And God said, Let the earth bring forth gra2s, the herb yielding s2ed, and the fruit tr2e yielding fruit after his kind, whose s2ed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. 
And the earth brought forth gra2s, and herb yielding s2ed after his kind, and the tr2e yielding fruit, whose s2ed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was g2od. 
And the evening and the morning were the third day. 
And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: 
And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 
And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the le2ser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. 
And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 
And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkne2s: and God saw that it was g2od. 
And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. 
And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. 
And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was g2od. 
And God ble2sed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fi2l the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. 
And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. 
And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, ca2tle, and cr2eping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. 
And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and ca2tle after their kind, and every thing that cr2epeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was g2od. 
And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likene2s: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the ca2tle, and over a2l the earth, and over every cr2eping thing that cr2epeth upon the earth. 
So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 
And God ble2sed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. 
And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing s2ed, which is upon the face of a2l the earth, and every tr2e, in the which is the fruit of a tr2e yielding s2ed; to you it sha2l be for meat. 
And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that cr2epeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every gr2en herb for meat: and it was so. 
And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very g2od. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. 
Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and a2l the host of them. 
And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from a2l his work which he had made. 
And God ble2sed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from a2l his work which God created and made. 
These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens, 
And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to ti2l the ground. 
But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. 
And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. 
And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. 
And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tr2e that is pleasant to the sight, and g2od for f2od; the tr2e of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tr2e of knowledge of g2od and evil. 
And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. 
The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compa2seth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 
And the gold of that land is g2od: there is bde2lium and the onyx stone. 
And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compa2seth the whole land of Ethiopia. 
And the name of the third river is Hi2dekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of A2syria. And the fourth river is Euphrates. 
And the LORD God t2ok the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dre2s it and to k2ep it. 
And the LORD God co2manded the man, saying, Of every tr2e of the garden thou mayest fr2ely eat: 
But of the tr2e of the knowledge of g2od and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. 
And the LORD God said, It is not g2od that the man should be alone; I wi2l make him an help m2et for him. 
And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to s2e what he would ca2l them: and whatsoever Adam ca2led every living creature, that was the name thereof. 
And Adam gave names to a2l ca2tle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help m2et for him. 
And the LORD God caused a d2ep sl2ep to fa2l upon Adam, and he slept: and he t2ok one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; 
And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. 
And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she sha2l be ca2led Woman, because she was taken out of Man. 
Therefore sha2l a man leave his father and his mother, and sha2l cleave unto his wife: and they sha2l be one flesh. 
And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. 
Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye sha2l not eat of every tr2e of the garden? 
And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the tr2es of the garden: 
But of the fruit of the tr2e which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye sha2l not eat of it, neither sha2l ye touch it, lest ye die. 
And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye sha2l not surely die: 
For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes sha2l be opened, and ye sha2l be as gods, knowing g2od and evil. 
And when the woman saw that the tr2e was g2od for f2od, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tr2e to be desired to make one wise, she t2ok of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. 
And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. 
And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the c2ol of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the tr2es of the garden. 
And the LORD God ca2led unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? 
And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself. 
And he said, Who told th2e that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tr2e, whereof I co2manded th2e that thou shouldest not eat? 
And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tr2e, and I did eat. 
And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. 
And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above a2l ca2tle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy be2ly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat a2l the days of thy life: 
And I wi2l put enmity betw2en th2e and the woman, and betw2en thy s2ed and her s2ed; it sha2l bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his h2el. 
Unto the woman he said, I wi2l greatly multiply thy so2row and thy conception; in so2row thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire sha2l be to thy husband, and he sha2l rule over th2e. 
And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tr2e, of which I co2manded th2e, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in so2row shalt thou eat of it a2l the days of thy life; 
Thorns also and thistles sha2l it bring forth to th2e; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; 
In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, ti2l thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. 
And Adam ca2led his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of a2l living. 
Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them. 
And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know g2od and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tr2e of life, and eat, and live for ever: 
Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to ti2l the ground from whence he was taken. 
So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to k2ep the way of the tr2e of life. 
And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have go2ten a man from the LORD. 
And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a k2eper of sh2ep, but Cain was a ti2ler of the ground. 
And in proce2s of time it came to pa2s, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an o2fering unto the LORD. 
And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his o2fering: 
But unto Cain and to his o2fering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fe2l. 
And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fa2len? 
If thou doest we2l, shalt thou not be a2cepted? and if thou doest not we2l, sin lieth at the d2or. And unto th2e sha2l be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. 
And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pa2s, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. 
And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's k2eper? 
And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's bl2od crieth unto me from the ground. 
And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's bl2od from thy hand; 
When thou ti2lest the ground, it sha2l not henceforth yield unto th2e her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth. 
And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear. 
Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face sha2l I be hid; and I sha2l be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it sha2l come to pa2s, that every one that findeth me sha2l slay me. 
And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance sha2l be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should ki2l him. 
And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. 
And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and ca2led the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch. 
And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech. 
And Lamech t2ok unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zi2lah. 
And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwe2l in tents, and of such as have ca2tle. 
And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of a2l such as handle the harp and organ. 
And Zi2lah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in bra2s and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was N2amah. 
And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zi2lah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my sp2ech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt. 
If Cain sha2l be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold. 
And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and ca2led his name Seth: For God, said she, hath a2pointed me another s2ed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew. 
And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he ca2led his name Enos: then began men to ca2l upon the name of the LORD. 
This is the b2ok of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likene2s of God made he him; 
Male and female created he them; and ble2sed them, and ca2led their name Adam, in the day when they were created. 
And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likene2s, and after his image; and ca2led his name Seth: 
And the days of Adam after he had bego2ten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters: 
And a2l the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died. 
And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 
And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters: 
And a2l the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died. 
And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: 
And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fift2en years, and begat sons and daughters: 
And a2l the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died. 
And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalal2el: 
And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalal2el eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters: 
And a2l the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died. 
And Mahalal2el lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: 
And Mahalal2el lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters: 
And a2l the days of Mahalal2el were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died. 
And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch: 
And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 
And a2l the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died. 
And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: 
And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah thr2e hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 
And a2l the days of Enoch were thr2e hundred sixty and five years: 
And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God t2ok him. 
And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech. 
And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters: 
And a2l the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died. 
And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son: 
And he ca2led his name Noah, saying, This same sha2l comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed. 
And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters: 
And a2l the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died. 
And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 
And it came to pa2s, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, 
That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they t2ok them wives of a2l which they chose. 
And the LORD said, My spirit sha2l not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days sha2l be an hundred and twenty years. 
There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. 
And God saw that the wickedne2s of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continua2ly. 
And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. 
And the LORD said, I wi2l destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the cr2eping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. 
But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD. 
These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God. 
And Noah begat thr2e sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 
The earth also was co2rupt before God, and the earth was fi2led with violence. 
And God l2oked upon the earth, and, behold, it was co2rupt; for a2l flesh had co2rupted his way upon the earth. 
And God said unto Noah, The end of a2l flesh is come before me; for the earth is fi2led with violence through them; and, behold, I wi2l destroy them with the earth. 
Make th2e an ark of gopher w2od; r2oms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. 
And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark sha2l be thr2e hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. 
A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the d2or of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. 
And, behold, I, even I, do bring a fl2od of waters upon the earth, to destroy a2l flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth sha2l die. 
But with th2e wi2l I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with th2e. 
And of every living thing of a2l flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to k2ep them alive with th2e; they sha2l be male and female. 
Of fowls after their kind, and of ca2tle after their kind, of every cr2eping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort sha2l come unto th2e, to k2ep them alive. 
And take thou unto th2e of a2l f2od that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to th2e; and it sha2l be for f2od for th2e, and for them. 
Thus did Noah; a2cording to a2l that God co2manded him, so did he. 
And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and a2l thy house into the ark; for th2e have I s2en righteous before me in this generation. 
Of every clean beast thou shalt take to th2e by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female. 
Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to k2ep s2ed alive upon the face of a2l the earth. 
For yet seven days, and I wi2l cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made wi2l I destroy from o2f the face of the earth. 
And Noah did a2cording unto a2l that the LORD co2manded him. 
And Noah was six hundred years old when the fl2od of waters was upon the earth. 
And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the fl2od. 
Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that cr2epeth upon the earth, 
There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had co2manded Noah. 
And it came to pa2s after seven days, that the waters of the fl2od were upon the earth. 
In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the sevent2enth day of the month, the same day were a2l the fountains of the great d2ep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. 
And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. 
In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the thr2e wives of his sons with them, into the ark; 
They, and every beast after his kind, and a2l the ca2tle after their kind, and every cr2eping thing that cr2epeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort. 
And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of a2l flesh, wherein is the breath of life. 
And they that went in, went in male and female of a2l flesh, as God had co2manded him: and the LORD shut him in. 
And the fl2od was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. 
And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. 
And the waters prevailed exc2edingly upon the earth; and a2l the high hi2ls, that were under the whole heaven, were covered. 
Fift2en cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. 
And a2l flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of ca2tle, and of beast, and of every cr2eping thing that cr2epeth upon the earth, and every man: 
A2l in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of a2l that was in the dry land, died. 
And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and ca2tle, and the cr2eping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark. 
And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. 
And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and a2l the ca2tle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pa2s over the earth, and the waters a2swaged; 
The fountains also of the d2ep and the windows of heaven were sto2ped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; 
And the waters returned from o2f the earth continua2ly: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. 
And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the sevent2enth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 
And the waters decreased continua2ly until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains s2en. 
And it came to pa2s at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: 
And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from o2f the earth. 
Also he sent forth a dove from him, to s2e if the waters were abated from o2f the face of the ground; 
But the dove found no rest for the sole of her f2ot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and t2ok her, and pu2led her in unto him into the ark. 
And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; 
And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt o2f: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from o2f the earth. 
And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more. 
And it came to pa2s in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from o2f the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and l2oked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry. 
And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried. 
And God spake unto Noah, saying, 
Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with th2e. 
Bring forth with th2e every living thing that is with th2e, of a2l flesh, both of fowl, and of ca2tle, and of every cr2eping thing that cr2epeth upon the earth; that they may br2ed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. 
And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him: 
Every beast, every cr2eping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever cr2epeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark. 
And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and t2ok of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and o2fered burnt o2ferings on the altar. 
And the LORD sme2led a sw2et savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I wi2l not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither wi2l I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. 
While the earth remaineth, s2edtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and su2mer and winter, and day and night sha2l not cease. 
And God ble2sed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. 
And the fear of you and the dread of you sha2l be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon a2l that moveth upon the earth, and upon a2l the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. 
Every moving thing that liveth sha2l be meat for you; even as the gr2en herb have I given you a2l things. 
But flesh with the life thereof, which is the bl2od thereof, sha2l ye not eat. 
And surely your bl2od of your lives wi2l I require; at the hand of every beast wi2l I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother wi2l I require the life of man. 
Whoso she2deth man's bl2od, by man sha2l his bl2od be shed: for in the image of God made he man. 
And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein. 
And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 
And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your s2ed after you; 
And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the ca2tle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from a2l that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. 
And I wi2l establish my covenant with you, neither sha2l a2l flesh be cut o2f any more by the waters of a fl2od; neither sha2l there any more be a fl2od to destroy the earth. 
And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make betw2en me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: 
I do set my bow in the cloud, and it sha2l be for a token of a covenant betw2en me and the earth. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow sha2l be s2en in the cloud: 
And I wi2l remember my covenant, which is betw2en me and you and every living creature of a2l flesh; and the waters sha2l no more become a fl2od to destroy a2l flesh. 
And the bow sha2l be in the cloud; and I wi2l l2ok upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant betw2en God and every living creature of a2l flesh that is upon the earth. 
And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established betw2en me and a2l flesh that is upon the earth. 
And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Can2an. 
These are the thr2e sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread. 
And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: 
And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. 
And Ham, the father of Can2an, saw the nakedne2s of his father, and told his two brethren without. 
And Shem and Japheth t2ok a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedne2s of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedne2s. 
And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. 
And he said, Cursed be Can2an; a servant of servants sha2l he be unto his brethren. 
And he said, Ble2sed be the LORD God of Shem; and Can2an sha2l be his servant. 
God sha2l enlarge Japheth, and he sha2l dwe2l in the tents of Shem; and Can2an sha2l be his servant. 
And Noah lived after the fl2od thr2e hundred and fifty years. 
And a2l the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died. 
Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the fl2od. 
The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. 
And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. 
And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Ki2tim, and Dodanim. 
By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations. 
And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Can2an. 
And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and R2amah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of R2amah; Sheba, and Dedan. 
And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. 
He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD. 
And the begi2ning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and A2cad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 
Out of that land went forth A2shur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, 
And Resen betw2en Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city. 
And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, 
And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim. 
And Can2an begat Sidon his first born, and Heth, 
And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, 
And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, 
And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Can2anites spread abroad. 
And the border of the Can2anites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomo2rah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. 
These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations. 
Unto Shem also, the father of a2l the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born. 
The children of Shem; Elam, and A2shur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. 
And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. 
And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. 
And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. 
And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, 
And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, 
And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, 
And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: a2l these were the sons of Joktan. 
And their dwe2ling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. 
These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. 
These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the fl2od. 
And the whole earth was of one language, and of one sp2ech. 
And it came to pa2s, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. 
And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. 
And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be sca2tered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. 
And the LORD came down to s2e the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. 
And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have a2l one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing wi2l be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. 
Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's sp2ech. 
So the LORD sca2tered them abroad from thence upon the face of a2l the earth: and they left o2f to build the city. 
Therefore is the name of it ca2led Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of a2l the earth: and from thence did the LORD sca2ter them abroad upon the face of a2l the earth. 
These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the fl2od: 
And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. 
And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: 
And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and thr2e years, and begat sons and daughters. 
And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: 
And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and thr2e years, and begat sons and daughters. 
And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: 
And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters. 
And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: 
And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters. 
And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: 
And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters. 
And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: 
And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. 
And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: 
And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and ninet2en years, and begat sons and daughters. 
And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. 
Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. 
And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chald2es. 
And Abram and Nahor t2ok them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. 
But Sarai was ba2ren; she had no child. 
And Terah t2ok Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chald2es, to go into the land of Can2an; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. 
And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran. 
Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get th2e out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I wi2l shew th2e: 
And I wi2l make of th2e a great nation, and I wi2l ble2s th2e, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a ble2sing: 
And I wi2l ble2s them that ble2s th2e, and curse him that curseth th2e: and in th2e sha2l a2l families of the earth be ble2sed. 
So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran. 
And Abram t2ok Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and a2l their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had go2ten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Can2an; and into the land of Can2an they came. 
And Abram pa2sed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Can2anite was then in the land. 
And the LORD a2peared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy s2ed wi2l I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who a2peared unto him. 
And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and ca2led upon the name of the LORD. 
And Abram journeyed, going on sti2l toward the south. 
And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land. 
And it came to pa2s, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to l2ok upon: 
Therefore it sha2l come to pa2s, when the Egyptians sha2l s2e th2e, that they sha2l say, This is his wife: and they wi2l ki2l me, but they wi2l save th2e alive. 
Say, I pray th2e, thou art my sister: that it may be we2l with me for thy sake; and my soul sha2l live because of th2e. 
And it came to pa2s, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. 
The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and co2mended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. 
And he entreated Abram we2l for her sake: and he had sh2ep, and oxen, and he a2ses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she a2ses, and camels. 
And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife. 
And Pharaoh ca2led Abram and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not te2l me that she was thy wife? 
Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way. 
And Pharaoh co2manded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and a2l that he had. 
And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and a2l that he had, and Lot with him, into the south. 
And Abram was very rich in ca2tle, in silver, and in gold. 
And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had b2en at the begi2ning, betw2en Bethel and Hai; 
Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the first: and there Abram ca2led on the name of the LORD. 
And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. 
And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwe2l together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwe2l together. 
And there was a strife betw2en the herdmen of Abram's ca2tle and the herdmen of Lot's ca2tle: and the Can2anite and the Peri2zite dwe2led then in the land. 
And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray th2e, betw2en me and th2e, and betw2en my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren. 
Is not the whole land before th2e? separate thyself, I pray th2e, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I wi2l go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I wi2l go to the left. 
And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld a2l the plain of Jordan, that it was we2l watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomo2rah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar. 
Then Lot chose him a2l the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other. 
Abram dwe2led in the land of Can2an, and Lot dwe2led in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom. 
But the men of Sodom were wicked and si2ners before the LORD exc2edingly. 
And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and l2ok from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 
For a2l the land which thou s2est, to th2e wi2l I give it, and to thy s2ed for ever. 
And I wi2l make thy s2ed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then sha2l thy s2ed also be numbered. 
Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I wi2l give it unto th2e. 
Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD. 
And it came to pa2s in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of E2lasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations; 
That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomo2rah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zebo2im, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar. 
A2l these were joined together in the vale of Si2dim, which is the salt sea. 
Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirt2enth year they rebe2led. 
And in the fourt2enth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 
And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderne2s. 
And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote a2l the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar. 
And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomo2rah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zebo2im, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined ba2tle with them in the vale of Si2dim; 
With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of E2lasar; four kings with five. 
And the vale of Si2dim was fu2l of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomo2rah fled, and fe2l there; and they that remained fled to the mountain. 
And they t2ok a2l the g2ods of Sodom and Gomo2rah, and a2l their victuals, and went their way. 
And they t2ok Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his g2ods, and departed. 
And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram. 
And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, thr2e hundred and eight2en, and pursued them unto Dan. 
And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. 
And he brought back a2l the g2ods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his g2ods, and the women also, and the people. 
And the king of Sodom went out to m2et him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the va2ley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale. 
And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. 
And he ble2sed him, and said, Ble2sed be Abram of the most high God, po2se2sor of heaven and earth: 
And ble2sed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of a2l. 
And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the g2ods to thyself. 
And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the po2se2sor of heaven and earth, 
That I wi2l not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I wi2l not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich: 
Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion. 
After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exc2eding great reward. 
And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, s2eing I go childle2s, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus? 
And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no s2ed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir. 
And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This sha2l not be thine heir; but he that sha2l come forth out of thine own bowels sha2l be thine heir. 
And he brought him forth abroad, and said, L2ok now toward heaven, and te2l the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So sha2l thy s2ed be. 
And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousne2s. 
And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought th2e out of Ur of the Chald2es, to give th2e this land to inherit it. 
And he said, LORD God, whereby sha2l I know that I sha2l inherit it? 
And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of thr2e years old, and a she goat of thr2e years old, and a ram of thr2e years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. 
And he t2ok unto him a2l these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not. 
And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away. 
And when the sun was going down, a d2ep sl2ep fe2l upon Abram; and, lo, an ho2ror of great darkne2s fe2l upon him. 
And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy s2ed sha2l be a stranger in a land that is not their's, and sha2l serve them; and they sha2l a2flict them four hundred years; 
And also that nation, whom they sha2l serve, wi2l I judge: and afterward sha2l they come out with great substance. 
And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a g2od old age. 
But in the fourth generation they sha2l come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet fu2l. 
And it came to pa2s, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that pa2sed betw2en those pieces. 
In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy s2ed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates: 
The Kenites, and the Keni2zites, and the Kadmonites, 
And the Hi2tites, and the Peri2zites, and the Rephaims, 
And the Amorites, and the Can2anites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites. 
Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. 
And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray th2e, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai. 
And Sarai Abram's wife t2ok Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Can2an, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife. 
And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistre2s was despised in her eyes. 
And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon th2e: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge betw2en me and th2e. 
But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do to her as it pleaseth th2e. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face. 
And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderne2s, by the fountain in the way to Shur. 
And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I fl2e from the face of my mistre2s Sarai. 
And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistre2s, and submit thyself under her hands. 
And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I wi2l multiply thy s2ed exc2edingly, that it sha2l not be numbered for multitude. 
And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child and shalt bear a son, and shalt ca2l his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy a2fliction. 
And he wi2l be a wild man; his hand wi2l be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he sha2l dwe2l in the presence of a2l his brethren. 
And she ca2led the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God s2est me: for she said, Have I also here l2oked after him that s2eth me? 
Wherefore the we2l was ca2led B2erlahairoi; behold, it is betw2en Kadesh and Bered. 
And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram ca2led his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael. 
And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram. 
And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD a2peared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. 
And I wi2l make my covenant betw2en me and th2e, and wi2l multiply th2e exc2edingly. 
And Abram fe2l on his face: and God talked with him, saying, 
As for me, behold, my covenant is with th2e, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. 
Neither sha2l thy name any more be ca2led Abram, but thy name sha2l be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made th2e. 
And I wi2l make th2e exc2eding fruitful, and I wi2l make nations of th2e, and kings sha2l come out of th2e. 
And I wi2l establish my covenant betw2en me and th2e and thy s2ed after th2e in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto th2e, and to thy s2ed after th2e. 
And I wi2l give unto th2e, and to thy s2ed after th2e, the land wherein thou art a stranger, a2l the land of Can2an, for an everlasting po2se2sion; and I wi2l be their God. 
And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt k2ep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy s2ed after th2e in their generations. 
This is my covenant, which ye sha2l k2ep, betw2en me and you and thy s2ed after th2e; Every man child among you sha2l be circumcised. 
And ye sha2l circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it sha2l be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. 
And he that is eight days old sha2l be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy s2ed. 
He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must n2eds be circumcised: and my covenant sha2l be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 
And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul sha2l be cut o2f from his people; he hath broken my covenant. 
And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not ca2l her name Sarai, but Sarah sha2l her name be. 
And I wi2l ble2s her, and give th2e a son also of her: yea, I wi2l ble2s her, and she sha2l be a mother of nations; kings of people sha2l be of her. 
Then Abraham fe2l upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Sha2l a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and sha2l Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear? 
And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before th2e! 
And God said, Sarah thy wife sha2l bear th2e a son ind2ed; and thou shalt ca2l his name Is2ac: and I wi2l establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his s2ed after him. 
And as for Ishmael, I have heard th2e: Behold, I have ble2sed him, and wi2l make him fruitful, and wi2l multiply him exc2edingly; twelve princes sha2l he beget, and I wi2l make him a great nation. 
But my covenant wi2l I establish with Is2ac, which Sarah sha2l bear unto th2e at this set time in the next year. 
And he left o2f talking with him, and God went up from Abraham. 
And Abraham t2ok Ishmael his son, and a2l that were born in his house, and a2l that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him. 
And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
And Ishmael his son was thirt2en years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son. 
And a2l the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him. 
And the LORD a2peared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent d2or in the heat of the day; 
And he lift up his eyes and l2oked, and, lo, thr2e men st2od by him: and when he saw them, he ran to m2et them from the tent d2or, and bowed himself toward the ground, 
And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pa2s not away, I pray th2e, from thy servant: 
Let a li2tle water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your f2et, and rest yourselves under the tr2e: 
And I wi2l fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye sha2l pa2s on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said. 
And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly thr2e measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth. 
And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and g2od, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dre2s it. 
And he t2ok bu2ter, and milk, and the calf which he had dre2sed, and set it before them; and he st2od by them under the tr2e, and they did eat. 
And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. 
And he said, I wi2l certainly return unto th2e a2cording to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife sha2l have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent d2or, which was behind him. 
Now Abraham and Sarah were old and we2l stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the ma2ner of women. 
Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old sha2l I have pleasure, my lord being old also? 
And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Sha2l I of a surety bear a child, which am old? 
Is any thing t2o hard for the LORD? At the time a2pointed I wi2l return unto th2e, a2cording to the time of life, and Sarah sha2l have a son. 
Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh. 
And the men rose up from thence, and l2oked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. 
And the LORD said, Sha2l I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; 
S2eing that Abraham sha2l surely become a great and mighty nation, and a2l the nations of the earth sha2l be ble2sed in him? 
For I know him, that he wi2l co2mand his children and his household after him, and they sha2l k2ep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. 
And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomo2rah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; 
I wi2l go down now, and s2e whether they have done altogether a2cording to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I wi2l know. 
And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham st2od yet before the LORD. 
And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? 
Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? 
That be far from th2e to do after this ma2ner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from th2e: Sha2l not the Judge of a2l the earth do right? 
And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I wi2l spare a2l the place for their sakes. 
And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes: 
Peradventure there sha2l lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy a2l the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I wi2l not destroy it. 
And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there sha2l be forty found there. And he said, I wi2l not do it for forty's sake. 
And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I wi2l speak: Peradventure there sha2l thirty be found there. And he said, I wi2l not do it, if I find thirty there. 
And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Peradventure there sha2l be twenty found there. And he said, I wi2l not destroy it for twenty's sake. 
And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I wi2l speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten sha2l be found there. And he said, I wi2l not destroy it for ten's sake. 
And the LORD went his way, as s2on as he had left co2muning with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place. 
And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot s2eing them rose up to m2et them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground; 
And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and ta2ry a2l night, and wash your f2et, and ye sha2l rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we wi2l abide in the str2et a2l night. 
And he pre2sed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat. 
But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compa2sed the house round, both old and young, a2l the people from every quarter: 
And they ca2led unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to th2e this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them. 
And Lot went out at the d2or unto them, and shut the d2or after him, 
And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly. 
Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is g2od in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my r2of. 
And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fe2low came in to sojourn, and he wi2l n2eds be a judge: now wi2l we deal worse with th2e, than with them. And they pre2sed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the d2or. 
But the men put forth their hand, and pu2led Lot into the house to them, and shut to the d2or. 
And they smote the men that were at the d2or of the house with blindne2s, both sma2l and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the d2or. 
And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place: 
For we wi2l destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it. 
And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which ma2ried his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD wi2l destroy this city. But he s2emed as one that mocked unto his sons in law. 
And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. 
And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city. 
And it came to pa2s, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; l2ok not behind th2e, neither stay thou in a2l the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. 
And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD: 
Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I ca2not escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: 
Behold now, this city is near to fl2e unto, and it is a li2tle one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a li2tle one?) and my soul sha2l live. 
And he said unto him, S2e, I have a2cepted th2e concerning this thing also, that I wi2l not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken. 
Haste th2e, escape thither; for I ca2not do anything ti2l thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was ca2led Zoar. 
The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar. 
Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomo2rah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven; 
And he overthrew those cities, and a2l the plain, and a2l the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. 
But his wife l2oked back from behind him, and she became a pi2lar of salt. 
And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he st2od before the LORD: 
And he l2oked toward Sodom and Gomo2rah, and toward a2l the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace. 
And it came to pa2s, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt. 
And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwe2l in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. 
And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the ma2ner of a2l the earth: 
Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we wi2l lie with him, that we may preserve s2ed of our father. 
And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 
And it came to pa2s on the mo2row, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve s2ed of our father. 
And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 
Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. 
And the first born bare a son, and ca2led his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day. 
And the younger, she also bare a son, and ca2led his name Bena2mi: the same is the father of the children of A2mon unto this day. 
And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwe2led betw2en Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. 
And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and t2ok Sarah. 
But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife. 
But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation? 
Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and i2nocency of my hands have I done this. 
And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also wit2held th2e from si2ning against me: therefore su2fered I th2e not to touch her. 
Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he sha2l pray for th2e, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and a2l that are thine. 
Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and ca2led a2l his servants, and told a2l these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. 
Then Abimelech ca2led Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I o2fended th2e, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done d2eds unto me that ought not to be done. 
And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? 
And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they wi2l slay me for my wife's sake. 
And yet ind2ed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. 
And it came to pa2s, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindne2s which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we sha2l come, say of me, He is my brother. 
And Abimelech t2ok sh2ep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. 
And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before th2e: dwe2l where it pleaseth th2e. 
And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to th2e a covering of the eyes, unto a2l that are with th2e, and with a2l other: thus she was reproved. 
So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children. 
For the LORD had fast closed up a2l the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife. 
And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken. 
For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. 
And Abraham ca2led the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Is2ac. 
And Abraham circumcised his son Is2ac being eight days old, as God had co2manded him. 
And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Is2ac was born unto him. 
And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that a2l that hear wi2l laugh with me. 
And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age. 
And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Is2ac was weaned. 
And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking. 
Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman sha2l not be heir with my son, even with Is2ac. 
And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son. 
And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in a2l that Sarah hath said unto th2e, hearken unto her voice; for in Is2ac sha2l thy s2ed be ca2led. 
And also of the son of the bondwoman wi2l I make a nation, because he is thy s2ed. 
And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and t2ok bread, and a bo2tle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, pu2ting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderne2s of B2ersheba. 
And the water was spent in the bo2tle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. 
And she went, and sat her down over against him a g2od way o2f, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not s2e the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept. 
And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God ca2led to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth th2e, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. 
Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I wi2l make him a great nation. 
And God opened her eyes, and she saw a we2l of water; and she went, and fi2led the bo2tle with water, and gave the lad drink. 
And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderne2s, and became an archer. 
And he dwelt in the wilderne2s of Paran: and his mother t2ok him a wife out of the land of Egypt. 
And it came to pa2s at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with th2e in a2l that thou doest: 
Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but a2cording to the kindne2s that I have done unto th2e, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. 
And Abraham said, I wi2l swear. 
And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a we2l of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away. 
And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou te2l me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day. 
And Abraham t2ok sh2ep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant. 
And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. 
And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? 
And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witne2s unto me, that I have di2ged this we2l. 
Wherefore he ca2led that place B2ersheba; because there they sware both of them. 
Thus they made a covenant at B2ersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. 
And Abraham planted a grove in B2ersheba, and ca2led there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God. 
And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days. 
And it came to pa2s after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am. 
And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Is2ac, whom thou lovest, and get th2e into the land of Moriah; and o2fer him there for a burnt o2fering upon one of the mountains which I wi2l te2l th2e of. 
And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and sa2dled his a2s, and t2ok two of his young men with him, and Is2ac his son, and clave the w2od for the burnt o2fering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. 
Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar o2f. 
And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the a2s; and I and the lad wi2l go yonder and worship, and come again to you. 
And Abraham t2ok the w2od of the burnt o2fering, and laid it upon Is2ac his son; and he t2ok the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together. 
And Is2ac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the w2od: but where is the lamb for a burnt o2fering? 
And Abraham said, My son, God wi2l provide himself a lamb for a burnt o2fering: so they went both of them together. 
And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the w2od in order, and bound Is2ac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the w2od. 
And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and t2ok the knife to slay his son. 
And the angel of the LORD ca2led unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. 
And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, s2eing thou hast not wit2held thy son, thine only son from me. 
And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and l2oked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and t2ok the ram, and o2fered him up for a burnt o2fering in the stead of his son. 
And Abraham ca2led the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it sha2l be s2en. 
And the angel of the LORD ca2led unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, 
And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not wit2held thy son, thine only son: 
That in ble2sing I wi2l ble2s th2e, and in multiplying I wi2l multiply thy s2ed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy s2ed sha2l po2se2s the gate of his enemies; 
And in thy s2ed sha2l a2l the nations of the earth be ble2sed; because thou hast obeyed my voice. 
So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to B2ersheba; and Abraham dwelt at B2ersheba. 
And it came to pa2s after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor; 
Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, 
And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel. 
And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother. 
And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and M2achah. 
And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah. 
And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Can2an: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to w2ep for her. 
And Abraham st2od up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying, 
I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a po2se2sion of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight. 
And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 
Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us sha2l wit2hold from th2e his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. 
And Abraham st2od up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth. 
And he co2muned with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, 
That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he sha2l give it me for a po2se2sion of a buryingplace amongst you. 
And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hi2tite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of a2l that went in at the gate of his city, saying, 
Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I th2e, and the cave that is therein, I give it th2e; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it th2e: bury thy dead. 
And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land. 
And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray th2e, hear me: I wi2l give th2e money for the field; take it of me, and I wi2l bury my dead there. 
And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, 
My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and th2e? bury therefore thy dead. 
And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, cu2rent money with the merchant. 
And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and a2l the tr2es that were in the field, that were in a2l the borders round about, were made sure 
Unto Abraham for a po2se2sion in the presence of the children of Heth, before a2l that went in at the gate of his city. 
And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Can2an. 
And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a po2se2sion of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth. 
And Abraham was old, and we2l stricken in age: and the LORD had ble2sed Abraham in a2l things. 
And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over a2l that he had, Put, I pray th2e, thy hand under my thigh: 
And I wi2l make th2e swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Can2anites, among whom I dwe2l: 
But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Is2ac. 
And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman wi2l not be wi2ling to fo2low me unto this land: must I n2eds bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest? 
And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again. 
The LORD God of heaven, which t2ok me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy s2ed wi2l I give this land; he sha2l send his angel before th2e, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence. 
And if the woman wi2l not be wi2ling to fo2low th2e, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again. 
And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that ma2ter. 
And the servant t2ok ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for a2l the g2ods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor. 
And he made his camels to kn2el down without the city by a we2l of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water. 
And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray th2e, send me g2od sp2ed this day, and shew kindne2s unto my master Abraham. 
Behold, I stand here by the we2l of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water: 
And let it come to pa2s, that the damsel to whom I sha2l say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray th2e, that I may drink; and she sha2l say, Drink, and I wi2l give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast a2pointed for thy servant Is2ac; and thereby sha2l I know that thou hast shewed kindne2s unto my master. 
And it came to pa2s, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder. 
And the damsel was very fair to l2ok upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the we2l, and fi2led her pitcher, and came up. 
And the servant ran to m2et her, and said, Let me, I pray th2e, drink a li2tle water of thy pitcher. 
And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink. 
And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I wi2l draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking. 
And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the we2l to draw water, and drew for a2l his camels. 
And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not. 
And it came to pa2s, as the camels had done drinking, that the man t2ok a golden ea2ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; 
And said, Whose daughter art thou? te2l me, I pray th2e: is there r2om in thy father's house for us to lodge in? 
And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor. 
She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and r2om to lodge in. 
And the man bowed down his head, and worshi2ped the LORD. 
And he said, Ble2sed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren. 
And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things. 
And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the we2l. 
And it came to pa2s, when he saw the ea2ring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he st2od by the camels at the we2l. 
And he said, Come in, thou ble2sed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and r2om for the camels. 
And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his f2et, and the men's f2et that were with him. 
And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I wi2l not eat, until I have told mine e2rand. And he said, Speak on. 
And he said, I am Abraham's servant. 
And the LORD hath ble2sed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and a2ses. 
And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given a2l that he hath. 
And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Can2anites, in whose land I dwe2l: 
But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son. 
And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman wi2l not fo2low me. 
And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, wi2l send his angel with th2e, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house: 
Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not th2e one, thou shalt be clear from my oath. 
And I came this day unto the we2l, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go: 
Behold, I stand by the we2l of water; and it sha2l come to pa2s, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray th2e, a li2tle water of thy pitcher to drink; 
And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I wi2l also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath a2pointed out for my master's son. 
And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the we2l, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray th2e. 
And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I wi2l give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also. 
And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the ea2ring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands. 
And I bowed down my head, and worshi2ped the LORD, and ble2sed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son. 
And now if ye wi2l deal kindly and truly with my master, te2l me: and if not, te2l me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left. 
Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proc2edeth from the LORD: we ca2not speak unto th2e bad or g2od. 
Behold, Rebekah is before th2e, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken. 
And it came to pa2s, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshi2ped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth. 
And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things. 
And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and ta2ried a2l night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master. 
And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she sha2l go. 
And he said unto them, Hinder me not, s2eing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master. 
And they said, We wi2l ca2l the damsel, and enquire at her mouth. 
And they ca2led Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I wi2l go. 
And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. 
And they ble2sed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of mi2lions, and let thy s2ed po2se2s the gate of those which hate them. 
And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and fo2lowed the man: and the servant t2ok Rebekah, and went his way. 
And Is2ac came from the way of the we2l Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country. 
And Is2ac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming. 
And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Is2ac, she lighted o2f the camel. 
For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to m2et us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she t2ok a vail, and covered herself. 
And the servant told Is2ac a2l things that he had done. 
And Is2ac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and t2ok Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Is2ac was comforted after his mother's death. 
Then again Abraham t2ok a wife, and her name was Keturah. 
And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. 
And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were A2shurim, and Letushim, and Leu2mim. 
And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eld2ah. A2l these were the children of Keturah. 
And Abraham gave a2l that he had unto Is2ac. 
But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Is2ac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. 
And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred thr2escore and fift2en years. 
Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a g2od old age, an old man, and fu2l of years; and was gathered to his people. 
And his sons Is2ac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hi2tite, which is before Mamre; 
The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. 
And it came to pa2s after the death of Abraham, that God ble2sed his son Is2ac; and Is2ac dwelt by the we2l Lahairoi. 
Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 
And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, a2cording to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adb2el, and Mibsam, 
And Mishma, and Dumah, and Ma2sa, 
Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 
These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes a2cording to their nations. 
And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people. 
And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward A2syria: and he died in the presence of a2l his brethren. 
And these are the generations of Is2ac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Is2ac: 
And Is2ac was forty years old when he t2ok Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian. 
And Is2ac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was ba2ren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. 
And the children stru2gled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD. 
And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two ma2ner of people sha2l be separated from thy bowels; and the one people sha2l be stronger than the other people; and the elder sha2l serve the younger. 
And when her days to be delivered were fulfi2led, behold, there were twins in her womb. 
And the first came out red, a2l over like an hairy garment; and they ca2led his name Esau. 
And after that came his brother out, and his hand t2ok hold on Esau's h2el; and his name was ca2led Jacob: and Is2ac was thr2escore years old when she bare them. 
And the boys grew: and Esau was a cu2ning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwe2ling in tents. 
And Is2ac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob. 
And Jacob sod po2tage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint: 
And Esau said to Jacob, F2ed me, I pray th2e, with that same red po2tage; for I am faint: therefore was his name ca2led Edom. 
And Jacob said, Se2l me this day thy birthright. 
And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit sha2l this birthright do to me? 
And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. 
Then Jacob gave Esau bread and po2tage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright. 
And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Is2ac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. 
And the LORD a2peared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwe2l in the land which I sha2l te2l th2e of: 
Sojourn in this land, and I wi2l be with th2e, and wi2l ble2s th2e; for unto th2e, and unto thy s2ed, I wi2l give a2l these countries, and I wi2l perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; 
And I wi2l make thy s2ed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and wi2l give unto thy s2ed a2l these countries; and in thy s2ed sha2l a2l the nations of the earth be ble2sed; 
Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my co2mandments, my statutes, and my laws. 
And Is2ac dwelt in Gerar: 
And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should ki2l me for Rebekah; because she was fair to l2ok upon. 
And it came to pa2s, when he had b2en there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines l2oked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Is2ac was sporting with Rebekah his wife. 
And Abimelech ca2led Is2ac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Is2ac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her. 
And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltine2s upon us. 
And Abimelech charged a2l his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife sha2l surely be put to death. 
Then Is2ac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD ble2sed him. 
And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great: 
For he had po2se2sion of flocks, and po2se2sion of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him. 
For a2l the we2ls which his father's servants had di2ged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had sto2ped them, and fi2led them with earth. 
And Abimelech said unto Is2ac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we. 
And Is2ac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the va2ley of Gerar, and dwelt there. 
And Is2ac di2ged again the we2ls of water, which they had di2ged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had sto2ped them after the death of Abraham: and he ca2led their names after the names by which his father had ca2led them. 
And Is2ac's servants di2ged in the va2ley, and found there a we2l of springing water. 
And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Is2ac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he ca2led the name of the we2l Esek; because they strove with him. 
And they di2ged another we2l, and strove for that also: and he ca2led the name of it Sitnah. 
And he removed from thence, and di2ged another we2l; and for that they strove not: and he ca2led the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made r2om for us, and we sha2l be fruitful in the land. 
And he went up from thence to B2ersheba. 
And the LORD a2peared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with th2e, and wi2l ble2s th2e, and multiply thy s2ed for my servant Abraham's sake. 
And he builded an altar there, and ca2led upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Is2ac's servants di2ged a we2l. 
Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahu2zath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army. 
And Is2ac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, s2eing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? 
And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with th2e: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and th2e, and let us make a covenant with th2e; 
That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched th2e, and as we have done unto th2e nothing but g2od, and have sent th2e away in peace: thou art now the ble2sed of the LORD. 
And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. 
And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Is2ac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. 
And it came to pa2s the same day, that Is2ac's servants came, and told him concerning the we2l which they had di2ged, and said unto him, We have found water. 
And he ca2led it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is B2ersheba unto this day. 
And Esau was forty years old when he t2ok to wife Judith the daughter of B2eri the Hi2tite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hi2tite: 
Which were a grief of mind unto Is2ac and to Rebekah. 
And it came to pa2s, that when Is2ac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not s2e, he ca2led Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I. 
And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death: 
Now therefore take, I pray th2e, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; 
And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may ble2s th2e before I die. 
And Rebekah heard when Is2ac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. 
And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 
Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and ble2s th2e before the LORD before my death. 
Now therefore, my son, obey my voice a2cording to that which I co2mand th2e. 
Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two g2od kids of the goats; and I wi2l make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth: 
And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may ble2s th2e before his death. 
And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a sm2oth man: 
My father peradventure wi2l f2el me, and I sha2l s2em to him as a deceiver; and I sha2l bring a curse upon me, and not a ble2sing. 
And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them. 
And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved. 
And Rebekah t2ok g2odly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son: 
And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the sm2oth of his neck: 
And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob. 
And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son? 
And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done a2cording as thou badest me: arise, I pray th2e, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may ble2s me. 
And Is2ac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me. 
And Is2ac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray th2e, that I may f2el th2e, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not. 
And Jacob went near unto Is2ac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. 
And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he ble2sed him. 
And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am. 
And he said, Bring it near to me, and I wi2l eat of my son's venison, that my soul may ble2s th2e. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank. 
And his father Is2ac said unto him, Come near now, and ki2s me, my son. 
And he came near, and ki2sed him: and he sme2led the sme2l of his raiment, and ble2sed him, and said, S2e, the sme2l of my son is as the sme2l of a field which the LORD hath ble2sed: 
Therefore God give th2e of the dew of heaven, and the fatne2s of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: 
Let people serve th2e, and nations bow down to th2e: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to th2e: cursed be every one that curseth th2e, and ble2sed be he that ble2seth th2e. 
And it came to pa2s, as s2on as Is2ac had made an end of ble2sing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Is2ac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 
And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may ble2s me. 
And Is2ac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau. 
And Is2ac trembled very exc2edingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of a2l before thou camest, and have ble2sed him? yea, and he sha2l be ble2sed. 
And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exc2eding bi2ter cry, and said unto his father, Ble2s me, even me also, O my father. 
And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy ble2sing. 
And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath su2planted me these two times: he t2ok away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my ble2sing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a ble2sing for me? 
And Is2ac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and a2l his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what sha2l I do now unto th2e, my son? 
And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one ble2sing, my father? ble2s me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. 
And Is2ac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwe2ling sha2l be the fatne2s of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above; 
And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it sha2l come to pa2s when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from o2f thy neck. 
And Esau hated Jacob because of the ble2sing wherewith his father ble2sed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then wi2l I slay my brother Jacob. 
And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and ca2led Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching th2e, doth comfort himself, purposing to ki2l th2e. 
Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, fl2e thou to Laban my brother to Haran; 
And ta2ry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away; 
Until thy brother's anger turn away from th2e, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I wi2l send, and fetch th2e from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day? 
And Rebekah said to Is2ac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what g2od sha2l my life do me? 
And Is2ac ca2led Jacob, and ble2sed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Can2an. 
Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take th2e a wife from thence of the daughers of Laban thy mother's brother. 
And God Almighty ble2s th2e, and make th2e fruitful, and multiply th2e, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; 
And give th2e the ble2sing of Abraham, to th2e, and to thy s2ed with th2e; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham. 
And Is2ac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother. 
When Esau saw that Is2ac had ble2sed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he ble2sed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughers of Can2an; 
And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram; 
And Esau s2eing that the daughters of Can2an pleased not Is2ac his father; 
Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and t2ok unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife. 
And Jacob went out from B2ersheba, and went toward Haran. 
And he lighted upon a certain place, and ta2ried there a2l night, because the sun was set; and he t2ok of the stones of that place, and put them for his pi2lows, and lay down in that place to sl2ep. 
And he dreamed, and behold a la2der set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. 
And, behold, the LORD st2od above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Is2ac: the land whereon thou liest, to th2e wi2l I give it, and to thy s2ed; 
And thy s2ed sha2l be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in th2e and in thy s2ed sha2l a2l the families of the earth be ble2sed. 
And, behold, I am with th2e, and wi2l k2ep th2e in a2l places whither thou goest, and wi2l bring th2e again into this land; for I wi2l not leave th2e, until I have done that which I have spoken to th2e of. 
And Jacob awaked out of his sl2ep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not. 
And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. 
And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and t2ok the stone that he had put for his pi2lows, and set it up for a pi2lar, and poured oil upon the top of it. 
And he ca2led the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was ca2led Luz at the first. 
And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God wi2l be with me, and wi2l k2ep me in this way that I go, and wi2l give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, 
So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then sha2l the LORD be my God: 
And this stone, which I have set for a pi2lar, sha2l be God's house: and of a2l that thou shalt give me I wi2l surely give the tenth unto th2e. 
Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east. 
And he l2oked, and behold a we2l in the field, and, lo, there were thr2e flocks of sh2ep lying by it; for out of that we2l they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the we2l's mouth. 
And thither were a2l the flocks gathered: and they ro2led the stone from the we2l's mouth, and watered the sh2ep, and put the stone again upon the we2l's mouth in his place. 
And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we. 
And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him. 
And he said unto them, Is he we2l? And they said, He is we2l: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sh2ep. 
And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the ca2tle should be gathered together: water ye the sh2ep, and go and f2ed them. 
And they said, We ca2not, until a2l the flocks be gathered together, and ti2l they ro2l the stone from the we2l's mouth; then we water the sh2ep. 
And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sh2ep; for she kept them. 
And it came to pa2s, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sh2ep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and ro2led the stone from the we2l's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. 
And Jacob ki2sed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. 
And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father. 
And it came to pa2s, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to m2et him, and embraced him, and ki2sed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban a2l these things. 
And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month. 
And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? te2l me, what sha2l thy wages be? 
And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 
Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and we2l favoured. 
And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I wi2l serve th2e seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. 
And Laban said, It is be2ter that I give her to th2e, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me. 
And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they s2emed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her. 
And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfi2led, that I may go in unto her. 
And Laban gathered together a2l the men of the place, and made a feast. 
And it came to pa2s in the evening, that he t2ok Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her. 
And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid. 
And it came to pa2s, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with th2e for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me? 
And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn. 
Fulfil her w2ek, and we wi2l give th2e this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. 
And Jacob did so, and fulfi2led her w2ek: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also. 
And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid. 
And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years. 
And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was ba2ren. 
And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she ca2led his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath l2oked upon my a2fliction; now therefore my husband wi2l love me. 
And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she ca2led his name Simeon. 
And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time wi2l my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him thr2e sons: therefore was his name ca2led Levi. 
And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now wi2l I praise the LORD: therefore she ca2led his name Judah; and left bearing. 
And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die. 
And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath wit2held from th2e the fruit of the womb? 
And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she sha2l bear upon my kn2es, that I may also have children by her. 
And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her. 
And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son. 
And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore ca2led she his name Dan. 
And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son. 
And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she ca2led his name Naphtali. 
When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she t2ok Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife. 
And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son. 
And Leah said, A tr2op cometh: and she ca2led his name Gad. 
And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son. 
And Leah said, Ha2py am I, for the daughters wi2l ca2l me ble2sed: and she ca2led his name Asher. 
And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray th2e, of thy son's mandrakes. 
And she said unto her, Is it a sma2l ma2ter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he sha2l lie with th2e to night for thy son's mandrakes. 
And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to m2et him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired th2e with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night. 
And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son. 
And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she ca2led his name I2sachar. 
And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son. 
And Leah said, God hath endued me with a g2od dowry; now wi2l my husband dwe2l with me, because I have born him six sons: and she ca2led his name Zebulun. 
And afterwards she bare a daughter, and ca2led her name Dinah. 
And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb. 
And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach: 
And she ca2led his name Joseph; and said, The LORD sha2l a2d to me another son. 
And it came to pa2s, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country. 
Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served th2e, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done th2e. 
And Laban said unto him, I pray th2e, if I have found favour in thine eyes, ta2ry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath ble2sed me for thy sake. 
And he said, A2point me thy wages, and I wi2l give it. 
And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served th2e, and how thy ca2tle was with me. 
For it was li2tle which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath ble2sed th2e since my coming: and now when sha2l I provide for mine own house also? 
And he said, What sha2l I give th2e? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I wi2l again f2ed and k2ep thy flock. 
I wi2l pa2s through a2l thy flock to day, removing from thence a2l the speckled and spo2ted ca2tle, and a2l the brown ca2tle among the sh2ep, and the spo2ted and speckled among the goats: and of such sha2l be my hire. 
So sha2l my righteousne2s answer for me in time to come, when it sha2l come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spo2ted among the goats, and brown among the sh2ep, that sha2l be counted stolen with me. 
And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be a2cording to thy word. 
And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spo2ted, and a2l the she goats that were speckled and spo2ted, and every one that had some white in it, and a2l the brown among the sh2ep, and gave them into the hand of his sons. 
And he set thr2e days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks. 
And Jacob t2ok him rods of gr2en poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tr2e; and pi2led white strakes in them, and made the white a2pear which was in the rods. 
And he set the rods which he had pi2led before the flocks in the gu2ters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink. 
And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth ca2tle ringstraked, speckled, and spo2ted. 
And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and a2l the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's ca2tle. 
And it came to pa2s, whensoever the stronger ca2tle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the ca2tle in the gu2ters, that they might conceive among the rods. 
But when the ca2tle were f2eble, he put them not in: so the f2ebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's. 
And the man increased exc2edingly, and had much ca2tle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and a2ses. 
And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away a2l that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he go2ten a2l this glory. 
And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before. 
And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I wi2l be with th2e. 
And Jacob sent and ca2led Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock, 
And said unto them, I s2e your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath b2en with me. 
And ye know that with a2l my power I have served your father. 
And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God su2fered him not to hurt me. 
If he said thus, The speckled sha2l be thy wages; then a2l the ca2tle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked sha2l be thy hire; then bare a2l the ca2tle ringstraked. 
Thus God hath taken away the ca2tle of your father, and given them to me. 
And it came to pa2s at the time that the ca2tle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the ca2tle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled. 
And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I. 
And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and s2e, a2l the rams which leap upon the ca2tle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have s2en a2l that Laban doeth unto th2e. 
I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pi2lar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get th2e out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred. 
And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house? 
Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money. 
For a2l the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto th2e, do. 
Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels; 
And he ca2ried away a2l his ca2tle, and a2l his g2ods which he had go2ten, the ca2tle of his ge2ting, which he had go2ten in Padanaram, for to go to Is2ac his father in the land of Can2an. 
And Laban went to shear his sh2ep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's. 
And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled. 
So he fled with a2l that he had; and he rose up, and pa2sed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead. 
And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. 
And he t2ok his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overt2ok him in the mount Gilead. 
And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take h2ed that thou speak not to Jacob either g2od or bad. 
Then Laban overt2ok Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead. 
And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and ca2ried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword? 
Wherefore didst thou fl2e away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not te2l me, that I might have sent th2e away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp? 
And hast not su2fered me to ki2s my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done f2olishly in so doing. 
It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou h2ed that thou speak not to Jacob either g2od or bad. 
And now, though thou wouldest n2eds be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods? 
And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me. 
With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to th2e. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them. 
And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent. 
Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched a2l the tent, but found them not. 
And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I ca2not rise up before th2e; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched but found not the images. 
And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespa2s? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me? 
Whereas thou hast searched a2l my stu2f, what hast thou found of a2l thy household stu2f? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both. 
This twenty years have I b2en with th2e; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten. 
That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto th2e; I bare the lo2s of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night. 
Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sl2ep departed from mine eyes. 
Thus have I b2en twenty years in thy house; I served th2e fourt2en years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy ca2tle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times. 
Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Is2ac, had b2en with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath s2en mine a2fliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked th2e yesternight. 
And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these ca2tle are my ca2tle, and a2l that thou s2est is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born? 
Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witne2s betw2en me and th2e. 
And Jacob t2ok a stone, and set it up for a pi2lar. 
And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they t2ok stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap. 
And Laban ca2led it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob ca2led it Gal2ed. 
And Laban said, This heap is a witne2s betw2en me and th2e this day. Therefore was the name of it ca2led Gal2ed; 
And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch betw2en me and th2e, when we are absent one from another. 
If thou shalt a2flict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; s2e, God is witne2s betwixt me and th2e. 
And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pi2lar, which I have cast betwixt me and th2e: 
This heap be witne2s, and this pi2lar be witne2s, that I wi2l not pa2s over this heap to th2e, and that thou shalt not pa2s over this heap and this pi2lar unto me, for harm. 
The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Is2ac. 
Then Jacob o2fered sacrifice upon the mount, and ca2led his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and ta2ried a2l night in the mount. 
And early in the morning Laban rose up, and ki2sed his sons and his daughters, and ble2sed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place. 
And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. 
And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he ca2led the name of that place Mahanaim. 
And Jacob sent me2sengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom. 
And he co2manded them, saying, Thus sha2l ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now: 
And I have oxen, and a2ses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to te2l my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight. 
And the me2sengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to m2et th2e, and four hundred men with him. 
Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distre2sed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands; 
And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left sha2l escape. 
And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Is2ac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I wi2l deal we2l with th2e: 
I am not worthy of the least of a2l the mercies, and of a2l the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my sta2f I pa2sed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands. 
Deliver me, I pray th2e, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he wi2l come and smite me, and the mother with the children. 
And thou saidst, I wi2l surely do th2e g2od, and make thy s2ed as the sand of the sea, which ca2not be numbered for multitude. 
And he lodged there that same night; and t2ok of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother; 
Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 
Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bu2ls, twenty she a2ses, and ten foals. 
And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pa2s over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. 
And he co2manded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother m2eteth th2e, and asketh th2e, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before th2e? 
Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us. 
And so co2manded he the second, and the third, and a2l that fo2lowed the droves, saying, On this ma2ner sha2l ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him. 
And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I wi2l a2pease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I wi2l s2e his face; peradventure he wi2l a2cept of me. 
So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company. 
And he rose up that night, and t2ok his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and pa2sed over the ford Ja2bok. 
And he t2ok them, and sent them over the br2ok, and sent over that he had. 
And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. 
And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the ho2low of his thigh; and the ho2low of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. 
And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I wi2l not let th2e go, except thou ble2s me. 
And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. 
And he said, Thy name sha2l be ca2led no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. 
And Jacob asked him, and said, Te2l me, I pray th2e, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he ble2sed him there. 
And Jacob ca2led the name of the place Peniel: for I have s2en God face to face, and my life is preserved. 
And as he pa2sed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh. 
Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the ho2low of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the ho2low of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank. 
And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and l2oked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. 
And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. 
And he pa2sed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. 
And Esau ran to m2et him, and embraced him, and fe2l on his neck, and ki2sed him: and they wept. 
And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with th2e? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant. 
Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves. 
And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves. 
And he said, What meanest thou by a2l this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord. 
And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; k2ep that thou hast unto thyself. 
And Jacob said, Nay, I pray th2e, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have s2en thy face, as though I had s2en the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me. 
Take, I pray th2e, my ble2sing that is brought to th2e; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he t2ok it. 
And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I wi2l go before th2e. 
And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, a2l the flock wi2l die. 
Let my lord, I pray th2e, pa2s over before his servant: and I wi2l lead on softly, a2cording as the ca2tle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir. 
And Esau said, Let me now leave with th2e some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What n2edeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord. 
So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir. 
And Jacob journeyed to Su2coth, and built him an house, and made b2oths for his ca2tle: therefore the name of the place is ca2led Su2coth. 
And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Can2an, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city. 
And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money. 
And he erected there an altar, and ca2led it EleloheIsrael. 
And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to s2e the daughters of the land. 
And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he t2ok her, and lay with her, and defiled her. 
And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel. 
And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife. 
And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his ca2tle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come. 
And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to co2mune with him. 
And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought fo2ly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done. 
And Hamor co2muned with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife. 
And make ye ma2riages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you. 
And ye sha2l dwe2l with us: and the land sha2l be before you; dwe2l and trade ye therein, and get you po2se2sions therein. 
And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye sha2l say unto me I wi2l give. 
Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I wi2l give a2cording as ye sha2l say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife. 
And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfu2ly, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister: 
And they said unto them, We ca2not do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us: 
But in this wi2l we consent unto you: If ye wi2l be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised; 
Then wi2l we give our daughters unto you, and we wi2l take your daughters to us, and we wi2l dwe2l with you, and we wi2l become one people. 
But if ye wi2l not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then wi2l we take our daughter, and we wi2l be gone. 
And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son. 
And the young man defe2red not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than a2l the house of his father. 
And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and co2muned with the men of their city, saying, 
These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwe2l in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters. 
Only herein wi2l the men consent unto us for to dwe2l with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised. 
Sha2l not their ca2tle and their substance and every beast of their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they wi2l dwe2l with us. 
And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened a2l that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, a2l that went out of the gate of his city. 
And it came to pa2s on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, t2ok each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew a2l the males. 
And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and t2ok Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out. 
The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister. 
They t2ok their sh2ep, and their oxen, and their a2ses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field, 
And a2l their wealth, and a2l their li2tle ones, and their wives t2ok they captive, and spoiled even a2l that was in the house. 
And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Can2anites and the Peri2zites: and I being few in number, they sha2l gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I sha2l be destroyed, I and my house. 
And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot? 
And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwe2l there: and make there an altar unto God, that a2peared unto th2e when thou fle2dest from the face of Esau thy brother. 
Then Jacob said unto his household, and to a2l that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments: 
And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I wi2l make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distre2s, and was with me in the way which I went. 
And they gave unto Jacob a2l the strange gods which were in their hand, and a2l their ea2rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. 
And they journeyed: and the te2ror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. 
So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Can2an, that is, Bethel, he and a2l the people that were with him. 
And he built there an altar, and ca2led the place Elbethel: because there God a2peared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. 
But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was ca2led A2lonbachuth. 
And God a2peared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and ble2sed him. 
And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name sha2l not be ca2led any more Jacob, but Israel sha2l be thy name: and he ca2led his name Israel. 
And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations sha2l be of th2e, and kings sha2l come out of thy loins; 
And the land which I gave Abraham and Is2ac, to th2e I wi2l give it, and to thy s2ed after th2e wi2l I give the land. 
And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him. 
And Jacob set up a pi2lar in the place where he talked with him, even a pi2lar of stone: and he poured a drink o2fering thereon, and he poured oil thereon. 
And Jacob ca2led the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel. 
And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a li2tle way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour. 
And it came to pa2s, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also. 
And it came to pa2s, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she ca2led his name Benoni: but his father ca2led him Benjamin. 
And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem. 
And Jacob set a pi2lar upon her grave: that is the pi2lar of Rachel's grave unto this day. 
And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar. 
And it came to pa2s, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 
The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and I2sachar, and Zebulun: 
The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: 
And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: 
And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram. 
And Jacob came unto Is2ac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Is2ac sojourned. 
And the days of Is2ac were an hundred and fourscore years. 
And Is2ac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and fu2l of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. 
Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom. 
Esau t2ok his wives of the daughters of Can2an; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hi2tite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 
And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth. 
And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel; 
And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and J2alam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Can2an. 
And Esau t2ok his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and a2l the persons of his house, and his ca2tle, and a2l his beasts, and a2l his substance, which he had got in the land of Can2an; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob. 
For their riches were more than that they might dwe2l together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their ca2tle. 
Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom. 
And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir: 
These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau. 
And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. 
And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife. 
And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Sha2mah, and Mi2zah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife. 
And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and J2alam, and Korah. 
These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz, 
Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah. 
And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Sha2mah, duke Mi2zah: these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife. 
And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke J2alam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife. 
These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes. 
These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah, 
And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom. 
And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna. 
And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. 
And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderne2s, as he fed the a2ses of Zibeon his father. 
And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah. 
And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran. 
The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Z2avan, and Akan. 
The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran. 
These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah, 
Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir. 
And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel. 
And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah. 
And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead. 
And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead. 
And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith. 
And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead. 
And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead. 
And Saul died, and B2alhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead. 
And B2alhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab. 
And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, a2cording to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth, 
Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon, 
Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar, 
Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, a2cording to their habitations in the land of their po2se2sion: he is Esau the father of the Edomites. 
And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Can2an. 
These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being sevent2en years old, was f2eding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report. 
Now Israel loved Joseph more than a2l his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours. 
And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than a2l his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him. 
And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more. 
And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed: 
For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also st2od upright; and, behold, your sheaves st2od round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. 
And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou ind2ed reign over us? or shalt thou ind2ed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words. 
And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the m2on and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. 
And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Sha2l I and thy mother and thy brethren ind2ed come to bow down ourselves to th2e to the earth? 
And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying. 
And his brethren went to f2ed their father's flock in Shechem. 
And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren f2ed the flock in Shechem? come, and I wi2l send th2e unto them. And he said to him, Here am I. 
And he said to him, Go, I pray th2e, s2e whether it be we2l with thy brethren, and we2l with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. 
And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What s2ekest thou? 
And he said, I s2ek my brethren: te2l me, I pray th2e, where they f2ed their flocks. 
And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. 
And when they saw him afar o2f, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him. 
And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. 
Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we wi2l say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we sha2l s2e what wi2l become of his dreams. 
And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not ki2l him. 
And Reuben said unto them, Shed no bl2od, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderne2s, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again. 
And it came to pa2s, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him; 
And they t2ok him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it. 
And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and l2oked, and, behold, a company of Ishm2elites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and my2rh, going to ca2ry it down to Egypt. 
And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his bl2od? 
Come, and let us se2l him to the Ishm2elites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content. 
Then there pa2sed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishm2elites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt. 
And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes. 
And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither sha2l I go? 
And they t2ok Joseph's coat, and ki2led a kid of the goats, and di2ped the coat in the bl2od; 
And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no. 
And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces. 
And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. 
And a2l his sons and a2l his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I wi2l go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him. 
And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an o2ficer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard. 
And it came to pa2s at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adu2lamite, whose name was Hirah. 
And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Can2anite, whose name was Shuah; and he t2ok her, and went in unto her. 
And she conceived, and bare a son; and he ca2led his name Er. 
And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she ca2led his name Onan. 
And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and ca2led his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him. 
And Judah t2ok a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar. 
And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him. 
And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and ma2ry her, and raise up s2ed to thy brother. 
And Onan knew that the s2ed should not be his; and it came to pa2s, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spi2led it on the ground, lest that he should give s2ed to his brother. 
And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also. 
Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, ti2l Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house. 
And in proce2s of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sh2epshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adu2lamite. 
And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sh2ep. 
And she put her widow's garments o2f from her, and covered her with a vail, and wra2ped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife. 
When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face. 
And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray th2e, let me come in unto th2e; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me? 
And he said, I wi2l send th2e a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, ti2l thou send it? 
And he said, What pledge sha2l I give th2e? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy sta2f that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him. 
And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowh2od. 
And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adu2lamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not. 
Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place. 
And he returned to Judah, and said, I ca2not find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place. 
And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her. 
And it came to pa2s about thr2e months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. 
When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray th2e, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and sta2f. 
And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath b2en more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more. 
And it came to pa2s in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb. 
And it came to pa2s, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife t2ok and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first. 
And it came to pa2s, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon th2e: therefore his name was ca2led Pharez. 
And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was ca2led Zarah. 
And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an o2ficer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishm2elites, which had brought him down thither. 
And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. 
And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made a2l that he did to prosper in his hand. 
And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overs2er over his house, and a2l that he had he put into his hand. 
And it came to pa2s from the time that he had made him overs2er in his house, and over a2l that he had, that the LORD ble2sed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the ble2sing of the LORD was upon a2l that he had in the house, and in the field. 
And he left a2l that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a g2odly person, and we2l favoured. 
And it came to pa2s after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. 
But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wo2teth not what is with me in the house, and he hath co2mi2ted a2l that he hath to my hand; 
There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but th2e, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedne2s, and sin against God? 
And it came to pa2s, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her. 
And it came to pa2s about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his busine2s; and there was none of the men of the house there within. 
And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out. 
And it came to pa2s, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth, 
That she ca2led unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, S2e, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice: 
And it came to pa2s, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out. 
And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home. 
And she spake unto him a2cording to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me: 
And it came to pa2s, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out. 
And it came to pa2s, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this ma2ner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled. 
And Joseph's master t2ok him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison. 
But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the k2eper of the prison. 
And the k2eper of the prison co2mi2ted to Joseph's hand a2l the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. 
The k2eper of the prison l2oked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper. 
And it came to pa2s after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had o2fended their lord the king of Egypt. 
And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his o2ficers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers. 
And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. 
And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward. 
And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man a2cording to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison. 
And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and l2oked upon them, and, behold, they were sad. 
And he asked Pharaoh's o2ficers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore l2ok ye so sadly to day? 
And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? te2l me them, I pray you. 
And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; 
And in the vine were thr2e branches: and it was as though it bu2ded, and her blo2soms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 
And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I t2ok the grapes, and pre2sed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand. 
And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The thr2e branches are thr2e days: 
Yet within thr2e days sha2l Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore th2e unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former ma2ner when thou wast his butler. 
But think on me when it sha2l be we2l with th2e, and shew kindne2s, I pray th2e, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house: 
For ind2ed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon. 
When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was g2od, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had thr2e white baskets on my head: 
And in the u2permost basket there was of a2l ma2ner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head. 
And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The thr2e baskets are thr2e days: 
Yet within thr2e days sha2l Pharaoh lift up thy head from o2f th2e, and sha2l hang th2e on a tr2e; and the birds sha2l eat thy flesh from o2f th2e. 
And it came to pa2s the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto a2l his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants. 
And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: 
But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. 
Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him. 
And it came to pa2s at the end of two fu2l years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he st2od by the river. 
And, behold, there came up out of the river seven we2l favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow. 
And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, i2l favoured and leanfleshed; and st2od by the other kine upon the brink of the river. 
And the i2l favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven we2l favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. 
And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and g2od. 
And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. 
And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and fu2l ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream. 
And it came to pa2s in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and ca2led for a2l the magicians of Egypt, and a2l the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh. 
Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day: 
Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker: 
And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man a2cording to the interpretation of his dream. 
And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man a2cording to his dream he did interpret. 
And it came to pa2s, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine o2fice, and him he hanged. 
Then Pharaoh sent and ca2led Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. 
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of th2e, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it. 
And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God sha2l give Pharaoh an answer of peace. 
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I st2od upon the bank of the river: 
And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and we2l favoured; and they fed in a meadow: 
And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, p2or and very i2l favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in a2l the land of Egypt for badne2s: 
And the lean and the i2l favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 
And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were sti2l i2l favoured, as at the begi2ning. So I awoke. 
And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, fu2l and g2od: 
And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: 
And the thin ears devoured the seven g2od ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me. 
And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do. 
The seven g2od kine are seven years; and the seven g2od ears are seven years: the dream is one. 
And the seven thin and i2l favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind sha2l be seven years of famine. 
This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. 
Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout a2l the land of Egypt: 
And there sha2l arise after them seven years of famine; and a2l the plenty sha2l be forgo2ten in the land of Egypt; and the famine sha2l consume the land; 
And the plenty sha2l not be known in the land by reason of that famine fo2lowing; for it sha2l be very grievous. 
And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God wi2l shortly bring it to pa2s. 
Now therefore let Pharaoh l2ok out a man discr2et and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. 
Let Pharaoh do this, and let him a2point o2ficers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. 
And let them gather a2l the f2od of those g2od years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them k2ep f2od in the cities. 
And that f2od sha2l be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which sha2l be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine. 
And the thing was g2od in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of a2l his servants. 
And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is? 
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed th2e a2l this, there is none so discr2et and wise as thou art: 
Thou shalt be over my house, and a2cording unto thy word sha2l a2l my people be ruled: only in the throne wi2l I be greater than thou. 
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, S2e, I have set th2e over a2l the land of Egypt. 
And Pharaoh t2ok o2f his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and a2rayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; 
And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the kn2e: and he made him ruler over a2l the land of Egypt. 
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without th2e sha2l no man lift up his hand or f2ot in a2l the land of Egypt. 
And Pharaoh ca2led Joseph's name Zaphnathp2aneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over a2l the land of Egypt. 
And Joseph was thirty years old when he st2od before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout a2l the land of Egypt. 
And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. 
And he gathered up a2l the f2od of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the f2od in the cities: the f2od of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same. 
And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number. 
And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him. 
And Joseph ca2led the name of the firstborn Mana2seh: For God, said he, hath made me forget a2l my toil, and a2l my father's house. 
And the name of the second ca2led he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my a2fliction. 
And the seven years of plenteousne2s, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended. 
And the seven years of dearth began to come, a2cording as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in a2l lands; but in a2l the land of Egypt there was bread. 
And when a2l the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto a2l the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. 
And the famine was over a2l the face of the earth: and Joseph opened a2l the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt. 
And a2l countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in a2l lands. 
Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye l2ok one upon another? 
And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die. 
And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt. 
But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befa2l him. 
And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Can2an. 
And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to a2l the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth. 
And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Can2an to buy f2od. 
And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. 
And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to s2e the nakedne2s of the land ye are come. 
And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy f2od are thy servants come. 
We are a2l one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies. 
And he said unto them, Nay, but to s2e the nakedne2s of the land ye are come. 
And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Can2an; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not. 
And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies: 
Hereby ye sha2l be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye sha2l not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. 
Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye sha2l be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies. 
And he put them a2l together into ward thr2e days. 
And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God: 
If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, ca2ry corn for the famine of your houses: 
But bring your youngest brother unto me; so sha2l your words be verified, and ye sha2l not die. And they did so. 
And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distre2s come upon us. 
And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his bl2od is required. 
And they knew not that Joseph underst2od them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter. 
And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and co2muned with them, and t2ok from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes. 
Then Joseph co2manded to fi2l their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them. 
And they laded their a2ses with the corn, and departed thence. 
And as one of them opened his sack to give his a2s provender in the i2n, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth. 
And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us? 
And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Can2an, and told him a2l that befe2l unto them; saying, 
The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and t2ok us for spies of the country. 
And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 
We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Can2an. 
And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby sha2l I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take f2od for the famine of your households, and be gone: 
And bring your youngest brother unto me: then sha2l I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so wi2l I deliver you your brother, and ye sha2l tra2fick in the land. 
And it came to pa2s as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. 
And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye wi2l take Benjamin away: a2l these things are against me. 
And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to th2e: deliver him into my hand, and I wi2l bring him to th2e again. 
And he said, My son sha2l not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befa2l him by the way in the which ye go, then sha2l ye bring down my gray hairs with so2row to the grave. 
And the famine was sore in the land. 
And it came to pa2s, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a li2tle f2od. 
And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye sha2l not s2e my face, except your brother be with you. 
If thou wilt send our brother with us, we wi2l go down and buy th2e f2od: 
But if thou wilt not send him, we wi2l not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye sha2l not s2e my face, except your brother be with you. 
And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so i2l with me, as to te2l the man whether ye had yet a brother? 
And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him a2cording to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down? 
And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we wi2l arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our li2tle ones. 
I wi2l be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto th2e, and set him before th2e, then let me bear the blame for ever: 
For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time. 
And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your ve2sels, and ca2ry down the man a present, a li2tle balm, and a li2tle honey, spices, and my2rh, nuts, and almonds: 
And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, ca2ry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: 
Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 
And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved. 
And the men t2ok that present, and they t2ok double money in their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and st2od before Joseph. 
And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men sha2l dine with me at n2on. 
And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house. 
And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may s2ek o2casion against us, and fa2l upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our a2ses. 
And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they co2muned with him at the d2or of the house, 
And said, O sir, we came ind2ed down at the first time to buy f2od: 
And it came to pa2s, when we came to the i2n, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in fu2l weight: and we have brought it again in our hand. 
And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy f2od: we ca2not te2l who put our money in our sacks. 
And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them. 
And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their f2et; and he gave their a2ses provender. 
And they made ready the present against Joseph came at n2on: for they heard that they should eat bread there. 
And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth. 
And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father we2l, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive? 
And they answered, Thy servant our father is in g2od health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance. 
And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto th2e, my son. 
And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to w2ep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there. 
And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread. 
And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians. 
And they sat before him, the firstborn a2cording to his birthright, and the youngest a2cording to his youth: and the men marve2led one at another. 
And he t2ok and sent me2ses unto them from before him: but Benjamin's me2s was five times so much as any of their's. And they drank, and were me2ry with him. 
And he co2manded the steward of his house, saying, Fi2l the men's sacks with f2od, as much as they can ca2ry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. 
And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did a2cording to the word that Joseph had spoken. 
As s2on as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their a2ses. 
And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far o2f, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, fo2low after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for g2od? 
Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby ind2ed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing. 
And he overt2ok them, and he spake unto them these same words. 
And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do a2cording to this thing: 
Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto th2e out of the land of Can2an: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold? 
With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also wi2l be my lord's bondmen. 
And he said, Now also let it be a2cording unto your words: he with whom it is found sha2l be my servant; and ye sha2l be blamele2s. 
Then they sp2edily t2ok down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. 
And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. 
Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his a2s, and returned to the city. 
And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fe2l before him on the ground. 
And Joseph said unto them, What d2ed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine? 
And Judah said, What sha2l we say unto my lord? what sha2l we speak? or how sha2l we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found. 
And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he sha2l be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father. 
Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray th2e, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh. 
My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? 
And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a li2tle one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him. 
And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. 
And we said unto my lord, The lad ca2not leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die. 
And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye sha2l s2e my face no more. 
And it came to pa2s when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. 
And our father said, Go again, and buy us a li2tle f2od. 
And we said, We ca2not go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then wi2l we go down: for we may not s2e the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us. 
And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons: 
And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: 
And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befa2l him, ye sha2l bring down my gray hairs with so2row to the grave. 
Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; s2eing that his life is bound up in the lad's life; 
It sha2l come to pa2s, when he s2eth that the lad is not with us, that he wi2l die: and thy servants sha2l bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with so2row to the grave. 
For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto th2e, then I sha2l bear the blame to my father for ever. 
Now therefore, I pray th2e, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. 
For how sha2l I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I s2e the evil that sha2l come on my father. 
Then Joseph could not refrain himself before a2l them that st2od by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there st2od no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren. 
And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard. 
And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence. 
And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. 
Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life. 
For these two years hath the famine b2en in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there sha2l neither be earing nor harvest. 
And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance. 
So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of a2l his house, and a ruler throughout a2l the land of Egypt. 
Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of a2l Egypt: come down unto me, ta2ry not: 
And thou shalt dwe2l in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and a2l that thou hast: 
And there wi2l I nourish th2e; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and a2l that thou hast, come to poverty. 
And, behold, your eyes s2e, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you. 
And ye sha2l te2l my father of a2l my glory in Egypt, and of a2l that ye have s2en; and ye sha2l haste and bring down my father hither. 
And he fe2l upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. 
Moreover he ki2sed a2l his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him. 
And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh we2l, and his servants. 
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Can2an; 
And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I wi2l give you the g2od of the land of Egypt, and ye sha2l eat the fat of the land. 
Now thou art co2manded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your li2tle ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. 
Also regard not your stu2f; for the g2od of a2l the land of Egypt is your's. 
And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, a2cording to the co2mandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. 
To a2l of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave thr2e hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment. 
And to his father he sent after this ma2ner; ten a2ses laden with the g2od things of Egypt, and ten she a2ses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way. 
So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, S2e that ye fa2l not out by the way. 
And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Can2an unto Jacob their father, 
And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over a2l the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not. 
And they told him a2l the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to ca2ry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: 
And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I wi2l go and s2e him before I die. 
And Israel t2ok his journey with a2l that he had, and came to B2ersheba, and o2fered sacrifices unto the God of his father Is2ac. 
And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I. 
And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I wi2l there make of th2e a great nation: 
I wi2l go down with th2e into Egypt; and I wi2l also surely bring th2e up again: and Joseph sha2l put his hand upon thine eyes. 
And Jacob rose up from B2ersheba: and the sons of Israel ca2ried Jacob their father, and their li2tle ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to ca2ry him. 
And they t2ok their ca2tle, and their g2ods, which they had go2ten in the land of Can2an, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and a2l his s2ed with him: 
His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and a2l his s2ed brought he with him into Egypt. 
And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn. 
And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Pha2lu, and Hezron, and Carmi. 
And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Can2anitish woman. 
And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Can2an. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul. 
And the sons of I2sachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron. 
And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahl2el. 
These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: a2l the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and thr2e. 
And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Ha2gi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli. 
And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel. 
These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixt2en souls. 
The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin. 
And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Mana2seh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him. 
And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and N2aman, Ehi, and Rosh, Mu2pim, and Hu2pim, and Ard. 
These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: a2l the souls were fourt2en. 
And the sons of Dan; Hushim. 
And the sons of Naphtali; Jahz2el, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shi2lem. 
These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: a2l the souls were seven. 
A2l the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, a2l the souls were thr2escore and six; 
And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: a2l the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were thr2escore and ten. 
And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. 
And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to m2et Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fe2l on his neck, and wept on his neck a g2od while. 
And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have s2en thy face, because thou art yet alive. 
And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I wi2l go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Can2an, are come unto me; 
And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath b2en to f2ed ca2tle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and a2l that they have. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, when Pharaoh sha2l ca2l you, and sha2l say, What is your o2cupation? 
That ye sha2l say, Thy servants' trade hath b2en about ca2tle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwe2l in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians. 
Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and a2l that they have, are come out of the land of Can2an; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen. 
And he t2ok some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh. 
And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your o2cupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers. 
They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Can2an: now therefore, we pray th2e, let thy servants dwe2l in the land of Goshen. 
And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto th2e: 
The land of Egypt is before th2e; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwe2l; in the land of Goshen let them dwe2l: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my ca2tle. 
And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob ble2sed Pharaoh. 
And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou? 
And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life b2en, and have not a2tained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage. 
And Jacob ble2sed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh. 
And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a po2se2sion in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had co2manded. 
And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and a2l his father's household, with bread, a2cording to their families. 
And there was no bread in a2l the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and a2l the land of Can2an fainted by reason of the famine. 
And Joseph gathered up a2l the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Can2an, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house. 
And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Can2an, a2l the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth. 
And Joseph said, Give your ca2tle; and I wi2l give you for your ca2tle, if money fail. 
And they brought their ca2tle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the ca2tle of the herds, and for the a2ses: and he fed them with bread for a2l their ca2tle for that year. 
When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We wi2l not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of ca2tle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands: 
Wherefore sha2l we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land wi2l be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us s2ed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate. 
And Joseph bought a2l the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's. 
And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof. 
Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion a2signed them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands. 
Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is s2ed for you, and ye sha2l sow the land. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in the increase, that ye sha2l give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts sha2l be your own, for s2ed of the field, and for your f2od, and for them of your households, and for f2od for your li2tle ones. 
And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we wi2l be Pharaoh's servants. 
And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's. 
And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had po2se2sions therein, and grew, and multiplied exc2edingly. 
And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt sevent2en years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years. 
And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he ca2led his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray th2e, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray th2e, in Egypt: 
But I wi2l lie with my fathers, and thou shalt ca2ry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I wi2l do as thou hast said. 
And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head. 
And it came to pa2s after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he t2ok with him his two sons, Mana2seh and Ephraim. 
And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto th2e: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed. 
And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty a2peared unto me at Luz in the land of Can2an, and ble2sed me, 
And said unto me, Behold, I wi2l make th2e fruitful, and multiply th2e, and I wi2l make of th2e a multitude of people; and wi2l give this land to thy s2ed after th2e for an everlasting po2se2sion. 
And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Mana2seh, which were born unto th2e in the land of Egypt before I came unto th2e into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they sha2l be mine. 
And thy i2sue, which thou bege2test after them, sha2l be thine, and sha2l be ca2led after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. 
And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Can2an in the way, when yet there was but a li2tle way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem. 
And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these? 
And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray th2e, unto me, and I wi2l ble2s them. 
Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not s2e. And he brought them near unto him; and he ki2sed them, and embraced them. 
And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to s2e thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy s2ed. 
And Joseph brought them out from betw2en his kn2es, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. 
And Joseph t2ok them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Mana2seh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him. 
And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Mana2seh's head, guiding his hands wi2tingly; for Mana2seh was the firstborn. 
And he ble2sed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Is2ac did walk, the God which fed me a2l my life long unto this day, 
The Angel which red2emed me from a2l evil, ble2s the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Is2ac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. 
And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Mana2seh's head. 
And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head. 
And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also sha2l become a people, and he also sha2l be great: but truly his younger brother sha2l be greater than he, and his s2ed sha2l become a multitude of nations. 
And he ble2sed them that day, saying, In th2e sha2l Israel ble2s, saying, God make th2e as Ephraim and as Mana2seh: and he set Ephraim before Mana2seh. 
And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God sha2l be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers. 
Moreover I have given to th2e one portion above thy brethren, which I t2ok out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow. 
And Jacob ca2led unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may te2l you that which sha2l befa2l you in the last days. 
Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father. 
Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the begi2ning of my strength, the exce2lency of dignity, and the exce2lency of power: 
Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch. 
Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations. 
O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their a2sembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwi2l they di2ged down a wa2l. 
Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I wi2l divide them in Jacob, and sca2ter them in Israel. 
Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren sha2l praise: thy hand sha2l be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children sha2l bow down before th2e. 
Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he st2oped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who sha2l rouse him up? 
The sceptre sha2l not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from betw2en his f2et, until Shiloh come; and unto him sha2l the gathering of the people be. 
Binding his foal unto the vine, and his a2s's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the bl2od of grapes: 
His eyes sha2l be red with wine, and his t2eth white with milk. 
Zebulun sha2l dwe2l at the haven of the sea; and he sha2l be for an haven of ships; and his border sha2l be unto Zidon. 
I2sachar is a strong a2s couching down betw2en two burdens: 
And he saw that rest was g2od, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute. 
Dan sha2l judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel. 
Dan sha2l be a serpent by the way, an a2der in the path, that biteth the horse h2els, so that his rider sha2l fa2l backward. 
I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD. 
Gad, a tr2op sha2l overcome him: but he sha2l overcome at the last. 
Out of Asher his bread sha2l be fat, and he sha2l yield royal dainties. 
Naphtali is a hind let l2ose: he giveth g2odly words. 
Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a we2l; whose branches run over the wa2l: 
The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: 
But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:) 
Even by the God of thy father, who sha2l help th2e; and by the Almighty, who sha2l ble2s th2e with ble2sings of heaven above, ble2sings of the d2ep that lieth under, ble2sings of the breasts, and of the womb: 
The ble2sings of thy father have prevailed above the ble2sings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hi2ls: they sha2l be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren. 
Benjamin sha2l ravin as a wolf: in the morning he sha2l devour the prey, and at night he sha2l divide the spoil. 
A2l these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and ble2sed them; every one a2cording to his ble2sing he ble2sed them. 
And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hi2tite, 
In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Can2an, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hi2tite for a po2se2sion of a buryingplace. 
There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Is2ac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. 
The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth. 
And when Jacob had made an end of co2manding his sons, he gathered up his f2et into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people. 
And Joseph fe2l upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and ki2sed him. 
And Joseph co2manded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel. 
And forty days were fulfi2led for him; for so are fulfi2led the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him thr2escore and ten days. 
And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 
My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have di2ged for me in the land of Can2an, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray th2e, and bury my father, and I wi2l come again. 
And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, a2cording as he made th2e swear. 
And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up a2l the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and a2l the elders of the land of Egypt, 
And a2l the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their li2tle ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. 
And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company. 
And they came to the threshingfl2or of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days. 
And when the inhabitants of the land, the Can2anites, saw the mourning in the fl2or of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was ca2led Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan. 
And his sons did unto him a2cording as he co2manded them: 
For his sons ca2ried him into the land of Can2an, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a po2se2sion of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hi2tite, before Mamre. 
And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and a2l that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father. 
And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph wi2l peradventure hate us, and wi2l certainly requite us a2l the evil which we did unto him. 
And they sent a me2senger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did co2mand before he died, saying, 
So sha2l ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray th2e now, the trespa2s of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto th2e evil: and now, we pray th2e, forgive the trespa2s of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him. 
And his brethren also went and fe2l down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants. 
And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God? 
But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto g2od, to bring to pa2s, as it is this day, to save much people alive. 
Now therefore fear ye not: I wi2l nourish you, and your li2tle ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them. 
And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years. 
And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Mana2seh were brought up upon Joseph's kn2es. 
And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God wi2l surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Is2ac, and to Jacob. 
And Joseph t2ok an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God wi2l surely visit you, and ye sha2l ca2ry up my bones from hence. 
So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a co2fin in Egypt. 
Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob. 
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 
I2sachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, 
Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 
And a2l the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already. 
And Joseph died, and a2l his brethren, and a2l that generation. 
And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exc2eding mighty; and the land was fi2led with them. 
Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. 
And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we: 
Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pa2s, that, when there fa2leth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land. 
Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to a2flict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and R2amses. 
But the more they a2flicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. 
And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour: 
And they made their lives bi2ter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in a2l ma2ner of service in the field: a2l their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour. 
And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: 
And he said, When ye do the o2fice of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and s2e them upon the st2ols; if it be a son, then ye sha2l ki2l him: but if it be a daughter, then she sha2l live. 
But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt co2manded them, but saved the men children alive. 
And the king of Egypt ca2led for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive? 
And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them. 
Therefore God dealt we2l with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. 
And it came to pa2s, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses. 
And Pharaoh charged a2l his people, saying, Every son that is born ye sha2l cast into the river, and every daughter ye sha2l save alive. 
And there went a man of the house of Levi, and t2ok to wife a daughter of Levi. 
And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a g2odly child, she hid him thr2e months. 
And when she could not longer hide him, she t2ok for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink. 
And his sister st2od afar o2f, to wit what would be done to him. 
And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. 
And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compa2sion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children. 
Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Sha2l I go and ca2l to th2e a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for th2e? 
And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and ca2led the child's mother. 
And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I wi2l give th2e thy wages. And the women t2ok the child, and nursed it. 
And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she ca2led his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water. 
And it came to pa2s in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and l2oked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. 
And he l2oked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. 
And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fe2low? 
And he said, Who made th2e a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to ki2l me, as thou ki2ledst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. 
Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a we2l. 
Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and fi2led the troughs to water their father's flock. 
And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses st2od up and helped them, and watered their flock. 
And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so s2on to day? 
And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock. 
And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? ca2l him, that he may eat bread. 
And Moses was content to dwe2l with the man: and he gave Moses Zi2porah his daughter. 
And she bare him a son, and he ca2led his name Gershom: for he said, I have b2en a stranger in a strange land. 
And it came to pa2s in proce2s of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. 
And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Is2ac, and with Jacob. 
And God l2oked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them. 
Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. 
And the angel of the LORD a2peared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he l2oked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. 
And Moses said, I wi2l now turn aside, and s2e this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. 
And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to s2e, God ca2led unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I. 
And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put o2f thy shoes from o2f thy f2et, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. 
Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Is2ac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to l2ok upon God. 
And the LORD said, I have surely s2en the a2fliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their so2rows; 
And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a g2od land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Can2anites, and the Hi2tites, and the Amorites, and the Peri2zites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also s2en the o2pre2sion wherewith the Egyptians o2pre2s them. 
Come now therefore, and I wi2l send th2e unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. 
And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? 
And he said, Certainly I wi2l be with th2e; and this sha2l be a token unto th2e, that I have sent th2e: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye sha2l serve God upon this mountain. 
And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and sha2l say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they sha2l say to me, What is his name? what sha2l I say unto them? 
And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. 
And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Is2ac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto a2l generations. 
Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Is2ac, and of Jacob, a2peared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and s2en that which is done to you in Egypt: 
And I have said, I wi2l bring you up out of the a2fliction of Egypt unto the land of the Can2anites, and the Hi2tites, and the Amorites, and the Peri2zites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. 
And they sha2l hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye sha2l say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we bes2ech th2e, thr2e days' journey into the wilderne2s, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God. 
And I am sure that the king of Egypt wi2l not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand. 
And I wi2l stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with a2l my wonders which I wi2l do in the midst thereof: and after that he wi2l let you go. 
And I wi2l give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it sha2l come to pa2s, that, when ye go, ye sha2l not go empty. 
But every woman sha2l bo2row of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye sha2l put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye sha2l spoil the Egyptians. 
And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they wi2l not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they wi2l say, The LORD hath not a2peared unto th2e. 
And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod. 
And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand: 
That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Is2ac, and the God of Jacob, hath a2peared unto th2e. 
And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he t2ok it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow. 
And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, if they wi2l not believe th2e, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they wi2l believe the voice of the la2ter sign. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, if they wi2l not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river sha2l become bl2od upon the dry land. 
And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of sp2ech, and of a slow tongue. 
And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the s2eing, or the blind? have not I the LORD? 
Now therefore go, and I wi2l be with thy mouth, and teach th2e what thou shalt say. 
And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray th2e, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send. 
And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak we2l. And also, behold, he cometh forth to m2et th2e: and when he s2eth th2e, he wi2l be glad in his heart. 
And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I wi2l be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and wi2l teach you what ye sha2l do. 
And he sha2l be thy spokesman unto the people: and he sha2l be, even he sha2l be to th2e instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God. 
And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs. 
And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray th2e, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and s2e whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace. 
And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for a2l the men are dead which sought thy life. 
And Moses t2ok his wife and his sons, and set them upon an a2s, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses t2ok the rod of God in his hand. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, s2e that thou do a2l those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I wi2l harden his heart, that he sha2l not let the people go. 
And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn: 
And I say unto th2e, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I wi2l slay thy son, even thy firstborn. 
And it came to pa2s by the way in the i2n, that the LORD met him, and sought to ki2l him. 
Then Zi2porah t2ok a sharp stone, and cut o2f the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his f2et, and said, Surely a bl2ody husband art thou to me. 
So he let him go: then she said, A bl2ody husband thou art, because of the circumcision. 
And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderne2s to m2et Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and ki2sed him. 
And Moses told Aaron a2l the words of the LORD who had sent him, and a2l the signs which he had co2manded him. 
And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together a2l the elders of the children of Israel: 
And Aaron spake a2l the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people. 
And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had l2oked upon their a2fliction, then they bowed their heads and worshi2ped. 
And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderne2s. 
And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither wi2l I let Israel go. 
And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray th2e, thr2e days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fa2l upon us with pestilence, or with the sword. 
And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens. 
And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens. 
And Pharaoh co2manded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their o2ficers, saying, 
Ye sha2l no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves. 
And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye sha2l lay upon them; ye sha2l not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God. 
Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words. 
And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their o2ficers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I wi2l not give you straw. 
Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work sha2l be diminished. 
So the people were sca2tered abroad throughout a2l the land of Egypt to gather stu2ble instead of straw. 
And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw. 
And the o2ficers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfi2led your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore? 
Then the o2ficers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? 
There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people. 
But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD. 
Go therefore now, and work; for there sha2l no straw be given you, yet sha2l ye deliver the tale of bricks. 
And the o2ficers of the children of Israel did s2e that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye sha2l not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task. 
And they met Moses and Aaron, who st2od in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: 
And they said unto them, The LORD l2ok upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abho2red in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us. 
And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me? 
For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at a2l. 
Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou s2e what I wi2l do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand sha2l he let them go, and with a strong hand sha2l he drive them out of his land. 
And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD: 
And I a2peared unto Abraham, unto Is2ac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them. 
And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Can2an, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers. 
And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians k2ep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant. 
Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I wi2l bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I wi2l rid you out of their bondage, and I wi2l red2em you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments: 
And I wi2l take you to me for a people, and I wi2l be to you a God: and ye sha2l know that I am the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 
And I wi2l bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Is2ac, and to Jacob; and I wi2l give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD. 
And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. 
And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then sha2l Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips? 
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. 
These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pa2lu, Hezron, and Carmi: these be the families of Reuben. 
And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Can2anitish woman: these are the families of Simeon. 
And these are the names of the sons of Levi a2cording to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years. 
The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, a2cording to their families. 
And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and U2ziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and thr2e years. 
And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of Levi a2cording to their generations. 
And Amram t2ok him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years. 
And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. 
And the sons of U2ziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri. 
And Aaron t2ok him Elisheba, daughter of A2minadab, sister of N2ashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
And the sons of Korah; A2sir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the families of the Korhites. 
And Eleazar Aaron's son t2ok him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites a2cording to their families. 
These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt a2cording to their armies. 
These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron. 
And it came to pa2s on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt, 
That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt a2l that I say unto th2e. 
And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how sha2l Pharaoh hearken unto me? 
And the LORD said unto Moses, S2e, I have made th2e a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother sha2l be thy prophet. 
Thou shalt speak a2l that I co2mand th2e: and Aaron thy brother sha2l speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land. 
And I wi2l harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. 
But Pharaoh sha2l not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. 
And the Egyptians sha2l know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them. 
And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD co2manded them, so did they. 
And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and thr2e years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
When Pharaoh sha2l speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it sha2l become a serpent. 
And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had co2manded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent. 
Then Pharaoh also ca2led the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like ma2ner with their enchantments. 
For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swa2lowed up their rods. 
And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go. 
Get th2e unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand. 
And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto th2e, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderne2s: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear. 
Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I wi2l smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they sha2l be turned to bl2od. 
And the fish that is in the river sha2l die, and the river sha2l stink; and the Egyptians sha2l lothe to drink of the water of the river. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon a2l their p2ols of water, that they may become bl2od; and that there may be bl2od throughout a2l the land of Egypt, both in ve2sels of w2od, and in ve2sels of stone. 
And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD co2manded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and a2l the waters that were in the river were turned to bl2od. 
And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was bl2od throughout a2l the land of Egypt. 
And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said. 
And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also. 
And a2l the Egyptians di2ged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river. 
And seven days were fulfi2led, after that the LORD had smi2ten the river. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I wi2l smite a2l thy borders with frogs: 
And the river sha2l bring forth frogs abundantly, which sha2l go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs: 
And the frogs sha2l come up both on th2e, and upon thy people, and upon a2l thy servants. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. 
And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. 
And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt. 
Then Pharaoh ca2led for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I wi2l let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD. 
And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when sha2l I intreat for th2e, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from th2e and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only? 
And he said, To mo2row. And he said, Be it a2cording to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God. 
And the frogs sha2l depart from th2e, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they sha2l remain in the river only. 
And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh. 
And the LORD did a2cording to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the vi2lages, and out of the fields. 
And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank. 
But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout a2l the land of Egypt. 
And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; a2l the dust of the land became lice throughout a2l the land of Egypt. 
And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast. 
Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I wi2l send swarms of flies upon th2e, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians sha2l be fu2l of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are. 
And I wi2l sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwe2l, that no swarms of flies sha2l be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth. 
And I wi2l put a division betw2en my people and thy people: to mo2row sha2l this sign be. 
And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into a2l the land of Egypt: the land was co2rupted by reason of the swarm of flies. 
And Pharaoh ca2led for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land. 
And Moses said, It is not m2et so to do; for we sha2l sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, sha2l we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and wi2l they not stone us? 
We wi2l go thr2e days' journey into the wilderne2s, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he sha2l co2mand us. 
And Pharaoh said, I wi2l let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderne2s; only ye sha2l not go very far away: intreat for me. 
And Moses said, Behold, I go out from th2e, and I wi2l intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to mo2row: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfu2ly any more in not le2ting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD. 
And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. 
And the LORD did a2cording to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one. 
And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go. 
Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and te2l him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them sti2l, 
Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy ca2tle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the a2ses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sh2ep: there sha2l be a very grievous mu2rain. 
And the LORD sha2l sever betw2en the ca2tle of Israel and the ca2tle of Egypt: and there sha2l nothing die of a2l that is the children's of Israel. 
And the LORD a2pointed a set time, saying, To mo2row the LORD sha2l do this thing in the land. 
And the LORD did that thing on the mo2row, and a2l the ca2tle of Egypt died: but of the ca2tle of the children of Israel died not one. 
And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the ca2tle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go. 
And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh. 
And it sha2l become sma2l dust in a2l the land of Egypt, and sha2l be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout a2l the land of Egypt. 
And they t2ok ashes of the furnace, and st2od before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast. 
And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon a2l the Egyptians. 
And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
For I wi2l at this time send a2l my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in a2l the earth. 
For now I wi2l stretch out my hand, that I may smite th2e and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut o2f from the earth. 
And in very d2ed for this cause have I raised th2e up, for to shew in th2e my power; and that my name may be declared throughout a2l the earth. 
As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go? 
Behold, to mo2row about this time I wi2l cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not b2en in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now. 
Send therefore now, and gather thy ca2tle, and a2l that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which sha2l be found in the field, and sha2l not be brought home, the hail sha2l come down upon them, and they sha2l die. 
He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his ca2tle fl2e into the houses: 
And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his ca2tle in the field. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in a2l the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt. 
And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt. 
So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in a2l the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 
And the hail smote throughout a2l the land of Egypt a2l that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tr2e of the field. 
Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail. 
And Pharaoh sent, and ca2led for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have si2ned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked. 
Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I wi2l let you go, and ye sha2l stay no longer. 
And Moses said unto him, As s2on as I am gone out of the city, I wi2l spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder sha2l cease, neither sha2l there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD's. 
But as for th2e and thy servants, I know that ye wi2l not yet fear the LORD God. 
And the flax and the barley was smi2ten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bo2led. 
But the wheat and the rie were not smi2ten: for they were not grown up. 
And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth. 
And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he si2ned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. 
And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him: 
And that thou mayest te2l in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD. 
And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me. 
Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to mo2row wi2l I bring the locusts into thy coast: 
And they sha2l cover the face of the earth, that one ca2not be able to s2e the earth: and they sha2l eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and sha2l eat every tr2e which groweth for you out of the field: 
And they sha2l fi2l thy houses, and the houses of a2l thy servants, and the houses of a2l the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have s2en, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh. 
And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long sha2l this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed? 
And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that sha2l go? 
And Moses said, We wi2l go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds wi2l we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD. 
And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I wi2l let you go, and your li2tle ones: l2ok to it; for evil is before you. 
Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even a2l that the hail hath left. 
And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land a2l that day, and a2l that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. 
And the locust went up over a2l the land of Egypt, and rested in a2l the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them sha2l be such. 
For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and a2l the fruit of the tr2es which the hail had left: and there remained not any gr2en thing in the tr2es, or in the herbs of the field, through a2l the land of Egypt. 
Then Pharaoh ca2led for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have si2ned against the LORD your God, and against you. 
Now therefore forgive, I pray th2e, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only. 
And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. 
And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which t2ok away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in a2l the coasts of Egypt. 
But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkne2s over the land of Egypt, even darkne2s which may be felt. 
And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkne2s in a2l the land of Egypt thr2e days: 
They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for thr2e days: but a2l the children of Israel had light in their dwe2lings. 
And Pharaoh ca2led unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your li2tle ones also go with you. 
And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt o2ferings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God. 
Our ca2tle also sha2l go with us; there sha2l not an h2of be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither. 
But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go. 
And Pharaoh said unto him, Get th2e from me, take h2ed to thyself, s2e my face no more; for in that day thou s2est my face thou shalt die. 
And Moses said, Thou hast spoken we2l, I wi2l s2e thy face again no more. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet wi2l I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he wi2l let you go hence: when he sha2l let you go, he sha2l surely thrust you out hence altogether. 
Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man bo2row of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and jewels of gold. 
And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people. 
And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight wi2l I go out into the midst of Egypt: 
And a2l the firstborn in the land of Egypt sha2l die, from the first born of Pharaoh that si2teth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mi2l; and a2l the firstborn of beasts. 
And there sha2l be a great cry throughout a2l the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor sha2l be like it any more. 
But against any of the children of Israel sha2l not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a di2ference betw2en the Egyptians and Israel. 
And a2l these thy servants sha2l come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get th2e out, and a2l the people that fo2low th2e: and after that I wi2l go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh sha2l not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. 
And Moses and Aaron did a2l these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying, 
This month sha2l be unto you the begi2ning of months: it sha2l be the first month of the year to you. 
Speak ye unto a2l the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they sha2l take to them every man a lamb, a2cording to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house: 
And if the household be t2o li2tle for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it a2cording to the number of the souls; every man a2cording to his eating sha2l make your count for the lamb. 
Your lamb sha2l be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye sha2l take it out from the sh2ep, or from the goats: 
And ye sha2l k2ep it up until the fourt2enth day of the same month: and the whole a2sembly of the congregation of Israel sha2l ki2l it in the evening. 
And they sha2l take of the bl2od, and strike it on the two side posts and on the u2per d2or post of the houses, wherein they sha2l eat it. 
And they sha2l eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bi2ter herbs they sha2l eat it. 
Eat not of it raw, nor so2den at a2l with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof. 
And ye sha2l let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye sha2l burn with fire. 
And thus sha2l ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your f2et, and your sta2f in your hand; and ye sha2l eat it in haste: it is the LORD's pa2sover. 
For I wi2l pa2s through the land of Egypt this night, and wi2l smite a2l the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against a2l the gods of Egypt I wi2l execute judgment: I am the LORD. 
And the bl2od sha2l be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I s2e the bl2od, I wi2l pa2s over you, and the plague sha2l not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt. 
And this day sha2l be unto you for a memorial; and ye sha2l k2ep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye sha2l k2ep it a feast by an ordinance for ever. 
Seven days sha2l ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye sha2l put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul sha2l be cut o2f from Israel. 
And in the first day there sha2l be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there sha2l be an holy convocation to you; no ma2ner of work sha2l be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you. 
And ye sha2l observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore sha2l ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever. 
In the first month, on the fourt2enth day of the month at even, ye sha2l eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even. 
Seven days sha2l there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul sha2l be cut o2f from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land. 
Ye sha2l eat nothing leavened; in a2l your habitations sha2l ye eat unleavened bread. 
Then Moses ca2led for a2l the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb a2cording to your families, and ki2l the pa2sover. 
And ye sha2l take a bunch of hy2sop, and dip it in the bl2od that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the bl2od that is in the bason; and none of you sha2l go out at the d2or of his house until the morning. 
For the LORD wi2l pa2s through to smite the Egyptians; and when he s2eth the bl2od upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD wi2l pa2s over the d2or, and wi2l not su2fer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you. 
And ye sha2l observe this thing for an ordinance to th2e and to thy sons for ever. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, when ye be come to the land which the LORD wi2l give you, a2cording as he hath promised, that ye sha2l k2ep this service. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, when your children sha2l say unto you, What mean ye by this service? 
That ye sha2l say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD's pa2sover, who pa2sed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshi2ped. 
And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had co2manded Moses and Aaron, so did they. 
And it came to pa2s, that at midnight the LORD smote a2l the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and a2l the firstborn of ca2tle. 
And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and a2l his servants, and a2l the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead. 
And he ca2led for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said. 
Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and ble2s me also. 
And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be a2l dead men. 
And the people t2ok their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. 
And the children of Israel did a2cording to the word of Moses; and they bo2rowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: 
And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians. 
And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Su2coth, about six hundred thousand on f2ot that were men, beside children. 
And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much ca2tle. 
And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not ta2ry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual. 
Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years. 
And it came to pa2s at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pa2s, that a2l the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt. 
It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of a2l the children of Israel in their generations. 
And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the pa2sover: There sha2l no stranger eat thereof: 
But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then sha2l he eat thereof. 
A foreigner and an hired servant sha2l not eat thereof. 
In one house sha2l it be eaten; thou shalt not ca2ry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither sha2l ye break a bone thereof. 
A2l the congregation of Israel sha2l k2ep it. 
And when a stranger sha2l sojourn with th2e, and wi2l k2ep the pa2sover to the LORD, let a2l his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and k2ep it; and he sha2l be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person sha2l eat thereof. 
One law sha2l be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you. 
Thus did a2l the children of Israel; as the LORD co2manded Moses and Aaron, so did they. 
And it came to pa2s the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Sanctify unto me a2l the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine. 
And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there sha2l no leavened bread be eaten. 
This day came ye out in the month Abib. 
And it sha2l be when the LORD sha2l bring th2e into the land of the Can2anites, and the Hi2tites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give th2e, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt k2ep this service in this month. 
Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day sha2l be a feast to the LORD. 
Unleavened bread sha2l be eaten seven days; and there sha2l no leavened bread be s2en with th2e, neither sha2l there be leaven s2en with th2e in a2l thy quarters. 
And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt. 
And it sha2l be for a sign unto th2e upon thine hand, and for a memorial betw2en thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought th2e out of Egypt. 
Thou shalt therefore k2ep this ordinance in his season from year to year. 
And it sha2l be when the LORD sha2l bring th2e into the land of the Can2anites, as he sware unto th2e and to thy fathers, and sha2l give it th2e, 
That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD a2l that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males sha2l be the LORD's. 
And every firstling of an a2s thou shalt red2em with a lamb; and if thou wilt not red2em it, then thou shalt break his neck: and a2l the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou red2em. 
And it sha2l be when thy son asketh th2e in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage: 
And it came to pa2s, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew a2l the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD a2l that openeth the matrix, being males; but a2l the firstborn of my children I red2em. 
And it sha2l be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets betw2en thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt. 
And it came to pa2s, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they s2e war, and they return to Egypt: 
But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderne2s of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harne2sed out of the land of Egypt. 
And Moses t2ok the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God wi2l surely visit you; and ye sha2l ca2ry up my bones away hence with you. 
And they t2ok their journey from Su2coth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderne2s. 
And the LORD went before them by day in a pi2lar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pi2lar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night: 
He t2ok not away the pi2lar of the cloud by day, nor the pi2lar of fire by night, from before the people. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, betw2en Migdol and the sea, over against B2alzephon: before it sha2l ye encamp by the sea. 
For Pharaoh wi2l say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderne2s hath shut them in. 
And I wi2l harden Pharaoh's heart, that he sha2l fo2low after them; and I wi2l be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon a2l his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so. 
And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us? 
And he made ready his chariot, and t2ok his people with him: 
And he t2ok six hundred chosen chariots, and a2l the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them. 
And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand. 
But the Egyptians pursued after them, a2l the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overt2ok them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before B2alzephon. 
And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD. 
And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderne2s? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to ca2ry us forth out of Egypt? 
Is not this the word that we did te2l th2e in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had b2en be2ter for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderne2s. 
And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand sti2l, and s2e the salvation of the LORD, which he wi2l shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have s2en to day, ye sha2l s2e them again no more for ever. 
The LORD sha2l fight for you, and ye sha2l hold your peace. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: 
But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel sha2l go on dry ground through the midst of the sea. 
And I, behold, I wi2l harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they sha2l fo2low them: and I wi2l get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon a2l his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. 
And the Egyptians sha2l know that I am the LORD, when I have go2ten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. 
And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pi2lar of the cloud went from before their face, and st2od behind them: 
And it came betw2en the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkne2s to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other a2l the night. 
And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind a2l that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. 
And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wa2l unto them on their right hand, and on their left. 
And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even a2l Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. 
And it came to pa2s, that in the morning watch the LORD l2oked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pi2lar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, 
And t2ok o2f their chariot wh2els, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us fl2e from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. 
And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning a2peared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. 
And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and a2l the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them. 
But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wa2l unto them on their right hand, and on their left. 
Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore. 
And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses. 
Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I wi2l sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. 
The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I wi2l prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I wi2l exalt him. 
The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name. 
Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea. 
The depths have covered them: they sank into the bo2tom as a stone. 
Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy. 
And in the greatne2s of thine exce2lency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against th2e: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stu2ble. 
And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the fl2ods st2od upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea. 
The enemy said, I wi2l pursue, I wi2l overtake, I wi2l divide the spoil; my lust sha2l be satisfied upon them; I wi2l draw my sword, my hand sha2l destroy them. 
Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters. 
Who is like unto th2e, O LORD, among the gods? who is like th2e, glorious in holine2s, fearful in praises, doing wonders? 
Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swa2lowed them. 
Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast red2emed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation. 
The people sha2l hear, and be afraid: so2row sha2l take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina. 
Then the dukes of Edom sha2l be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling sha2l take hold upon them; a2l the inhabitants of Can2an sha2l melt away. 
Fear and dread sha2l fa2l upon them; by the greatne2s of thine arm they sha2l be as sti2l as a stone; ti2l thy people pa2s over, O LORD, ti2l the people pa2s over, which thou hast purchased. 
Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for th2e to dwe2l in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have established. 
The LORD sha2l reign for ever and ever. 
For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea. 
And Miriam the prophete2s, the sister of Aaron, t2ok a timbrel in her hand; and a2l the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. 
And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. 
So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderne2s of Shur; and they went thr2e days in the wilderne2s, and found no water. 
And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bi2ter: therefore the name of it was ca2led Marah. 
And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What sha2l we drink? 
And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tr2e, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sw2et: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them, 
And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his co2mandments, and k2ep a2l his statutes, I wi2l put none of these diseases upon th2e, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth th2e. 
And they came to Elim, where were twelve we2ls of water, and thr2escore and ten palm tr2es: and they encamped there by the waters. 
And they t2ok their journey from Elim, and a2l the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderne2s of Sin, which is betw2en Elim and Sinai, on the fift2enth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt. 
And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderne2s: 
And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the fu2l; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderne2s, to ki2l this whole a2sembly with hunger. 
Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I wi2l rain bread from heaven for you; and the people sha2l go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they wi2l walk in my law, or no. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that on the sixth day they sha2l prepare that which they bring in; and it sha2l be twice as much as they gather daily. 
And Moses and Aaron said unto a2l the children of Israel, At even, then ye sha2l know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt: 
And in the morning, then ye sha2l s2e the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against us? 
And Moses said, This sha2l be, when the LORD sha2l give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the fu2l; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD. 
And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto a2l the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings. 
And it came to pa2s, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they l2oked toward the wilderne2s, and, behold, the glory of the LORD a2peared in the cloud. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye sha2l eat flesh, and in the morning ye sha2l be fi2led with bread; and ye sha2l know that I am the LORD your God. 
And it came to pa2s, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host. 
And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderne2s there lay a sma2l round thing, as sma2l as the hoar frost on the ground. 
And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is ma2na: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat. 
This is the thing which the LORD hath co2manded, Gather of it every man a2cording to his eating, an omer for every man, a2cording to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents. 
And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some le2s. 
And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered li2tle had no lack; they gathered every man a2cording to his eating. 
And Moses said, Let no man leave of it ti2l the morning. 
Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them. 
And they gathered it every morning, every man a2cording to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted. 
And it came to pa2s, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and a2l the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. 
And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To mo2row is the rest of the holy sa2bath unto the LORD: bake that which ye wi2l bake to day, and s2ethe that ye wi2l s2ethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning. 
And they laid it up ti2l the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein. 
And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sa2bath unto the LORD: to day ye sha2l not find it in the field. 
Six days ye sha2l gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sa2bath, in it there sha2l be none. 
And it came to pa2s, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to k2ep my co2mandments and my laws? 
S2e, for that the LORD hath given you the sa2bath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. 
So the people rested on the seventh day. 
And the house of Israel ca2led the name thereof Ma2na: and it was like coriander s2ed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. 
And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD co2mandeth, Fi2l an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may s2e the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderne2s, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. 
And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer fu2l of ma2na therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations. 
As the LORD co2manded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. 
And the children of Israel did eat ma2na forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat ma2na, until they came unto the borders of the land of Can2an. 
Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah. 
And a2l the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderne2s of Sin, after their journeys, a2cording to the co2mandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink. 
Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD? 
And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to ki2l us and our children and our ca2tle with thirst? 
And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What sha2l I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with th2e of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go. 
Behold, I wi2l stand before th2e there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there sha2l come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. 
And he ca2led the name of the place Ma2sah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not? 
Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. 
And Moses said unto Joshua, Ch2ose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to mo2row I wi2l stand on the top of the hi2l with the rod of God in mine hand. 
So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hi2l. 
And it came to pa2s, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. 
But Moses hands were heavy; and they t2ok a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. 
And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a b2ok, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I wi2l u2terly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. 
And Moses built an altar, and ca2led the name of it Jehovahni2si: 
For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD wi2l have war with Amalek from generation to generation. 
When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of a2l that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt; 
Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, t2ok Zi2porah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back, 
And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have b2en an alien in a strange land: 
And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh: 
And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderne2s, where he encamped at the mount of God: 
And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto th2e, and thy wife, and her two sons with her. 
And Moses went out to m2et his father in law, and did obeisance, and ki2sed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent. 
And Moses told his father in law a2l that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and a2l the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them. 
And Jethro rejoiced for a2l the g2odne2s which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians. 
And Jethro said, Ble2sed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. 
Now I know that the LORD is greater than a2l gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them. 
And Jethro, Moses' father in law, t2ok a burnt o2fering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and a2l the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God. 
And it came to pa2s on the mo2row, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people st2od by Moses from the morning unto the evening. 
And when Moses' father in law saw a2l that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why si2test thou thyself alone, and a2l the people stand by th2e from morning unto even? 
And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God: 
When they have a ma2ter, they come unto me; and I judge betw2en one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws. 
And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not g2od. 
Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with th2e: for this thing is t2o heavy for th2e; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone. 
Hearken now unto my voice, I wi2l give th2e counsel, and God sha2l be with th2e: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God: 
And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do. 
Moreover thou shalt provide out of a2l the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousne2s; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: 
And let them judge the people at a2l seasons: and it sha2l be, that every great ma2ter they sha2l bring unto th2e, but every sma2l ma2ter they sha2l judge: so sha2l it be easier for thyself, and they sha2l bear the burden with th2e. 
If thou shalt do this thing, and God co2mand th2e so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and a2l this people sha2l also go to their place in peace. 
So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did a2l that he had said. 
And Moses chose able men out of a2l Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 
And they judged the people at a2l seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every sma2l ma2ter they judged themselves. 
And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land. 
In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderne2s of Sinai. 
For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderne2s; and there Israel camped before the mount. 
And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD ca2led unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and te2l the children of Israel; 
Ye have s2en what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself. 
Now therefore, if ye wi2l obey my voice ind2ed, and k2ep my covenant, then ye sha2l be a peculiar treasure unto me above a2l people: for a2l the earth is mine: 
And ye sha2l be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. 
And Moses came and ca2led for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces a2l these words which the LORD co2manded him. 
And a2l the people answered together, and said, A2l that the LORD hath spoken we wi2l do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto th2e in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with th2e, and believe th2e for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to mo2row, and let them wash their clothes, 
And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD wi2l come down in the sight of a2l the people upon mount Sinai. 
And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take h2ed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount sha2l be surely put to death: 
There sha2l not an hand touch it, but he sha2l surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it sha2l not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they sha2l come up to the mount. 
And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. 
And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives. 
And it came to pa2s on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exc2eding loud; so that a2l the people that was in the camp trembled. 
And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to m2et with God; and they st2od at the nether part of the mount. 
And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. 
And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. 
And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD ca2led Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish. 
And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them. 
And Moses said unto the LORD, The people ca2not come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it. 
And the LORD said unto him, Away, get th2e down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with th2e: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them. 
So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them. 
And God spake a2l these words, saying, 
I am the LORD thy God, which have brought th2e out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 
Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 
Thou shalt not make unto th2e any graven image, or any likene2s of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 
Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; 
And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and k2ep my co2mandments. 
Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD wi2l not hold him guiltle2s that taketh his name in vain. 
Remember the sa2bath day, to k2ep it holy. 
Six days shalt thou labour, and do a2l thy work: 
But the seventh day is the sa2bath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy ca2tle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: 
For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and a2l that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD ble2sed the sa2bath day, and ha2lowed it. 
Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth th2e. 
Thou shalt not ki2l. 
Thou shalt not co2mit adultery. 
Thou shalt not steal. 
Thou shalt not bear false witne2s against thy neighbour. 
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his a2s, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's. 
And a2l the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and st2od afar o2f. 
And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we wi2l hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die. 
And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not. 
And the people st2od afar o2f, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkne2s where God was. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have s2en that I have talked with you from heaven. 
Ye sha2l not make with me gods of silver, neither sha2l ye make unto you gods of gold. 
An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt o2ferings, and thy peace o2ferings, thy sh2ep, and thine oxen: in a2l places where I record my name I wi2l come unto th2e, and I wi2l ble2s th2e. 
And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy t2ol upon it, thou hast po2luted it. 
Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedne2s be not discovered thereon. 
Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them. 
If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he sha2l serve: and in the seventh he sha2l go out fr2e for nothing. 
If he came in by himself, he sha2l go out by himself: if he were ma2ried, then his wife sha2l go out with him. 
If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children sha2l be her master's, and he sha2l go out by himself. 
And if the servant sha2l plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I wi2l not go out fr2e: 
Then his master sha2l bring him unto the judges; he sha2l also bring him to the d2or, or unto the d2or post; and his master sha2l bore his ear through with an aul; and he sha2l serve him for ever. 
And if a man se2l his daughter to be a maidservant, she sha2l not go out as the menservants do. 
If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then sha2l he let her be red2emed: to se2l her unto a strange nation he sha2l have no power, s2eing he hath dealt deceitfu2ly with her. 
And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he sha2l deal with her after the ma2ner of daughters. 
If he take him another wife; her f2od, her raiment, and her duty of ma2riage, sha2l he not diminish. 
And if he do not these thr2e unto her, then sha2l she go out fr2e without money. 
He that smiteth a man, so that he die, sha2l be surely put to death. 
And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I wi2l a2point th2e a place whither he sha2l fl2e. 
But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die. 
And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, sha2l be surely put to death. 
And he that stealeth a man, and se2leth him, or if he be found in his hand, he sha2l surely be put to death. 
And he that curseth his father, or his mother, sha2l surely be put to death. 
And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but k2epeth his bed: 
If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his sta2f, then sha2l he that smote him be quit: only he sha2l pay for the lo2s of his time, and sha2l cause him to be thoroughly healed. 
And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he sha2l be surely punished. 
Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he sha2l not be punished: for he is his money. 
If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief fo2low: he sha2l be surely punished, a2cording as the woman's husband wi2l lay upon him; and he sha2l pay as the judges determine. 
And if any mischief fo2low, then thou shalt give life for life, 
Eye for eye, t2oth for t2oth, hand for hand, f2ot for f2ot, 
Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. 
And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he sha2l let him go fr2e for his eye's sake. 
And if he smite out his manservant's t2oth, or his maidservant's t2oth; he sha2l let him go fr2e for his t2oth's sake. 
If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox sha2l be surely stoned, and his flesh sha2l not be eaten; but the owner of the ox sha2l be quit. 
But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath b2en testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath ki2led a man or a woman; the ox sha2l be stoned, and his owner also sha2l be put to death. 
If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he sha2l give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. 
Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, a2cording to this judgment sha2l it be done unto him. 
If the ox sha2l push a manservant or a maidservant; he sha2l give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox sha2l be stoned. 
And if a man sha2l open a pit, or if a man sha2l dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an a2s fa2l therein; 
The owner of the pit sha2l make it g2od, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast sha2l be his. 
And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they sha2l se2l the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they sha2l divide. 
Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he sha2l surely pay ox for ox; and the dead sha2l be his own. 
If a man sha2l steal an ox, or a sh2ep, and ki2l it, or se2l it; he sha2l restore five oxen for an ox, and four sh2ep for a sh2ep. 
If a thief be found breaking up, and be smi2ten that he die, there sha2l no bl2od be shed for him. 
If the sun be risen upon him, there sha2l be bl2od shed for him; for he should make fu2l restitution; if he have nothing, then he sha2l be sold for his theft. 
If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or a2s, or sh2ep; he sha2l restore double. 
If a man sha2l cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and sha2l put in his beast, and sha2l f2ed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, sha2l he make restitution. 
If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire sha2l surely make restitution. 
If a man sha2l deliver unto his neighbour money or stu2f to k2ep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay double. 
If the thief be not found, then the master of the house sha2l be brought unto the judges, to s2e whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour's g2ods. 
For a2l ma2ner of trespa2s, whether it be for ox, for a2s, for sh2ep, for raiment, or for any ma2ner of lost thing which another cha2lengeth to be his, the cause of both parties sha2l come before the judges; and whom the judges sha2l condemn, he sha2l pay double unto his neighbour. 
If a man deliver unto his neighbour an a2s, or an ox, or a sh2ep, or any beast, to k2ep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man s2eing it: 
Then sha2l an oath of the LORD be betw2en them both, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's g2ods; and the owner of it sha2l a2cept thereof, and he sha2l not make it g2od. 
And if it be stolen from him, he sha2l make restitution unto the owner thereof. 
If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witne2s, and he sha2l not make g2od that which was torn. 
And if a man bo2row ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he sha2l surely make it g2od. 
But if the owner thereof be with it, he sha2l not make it g2od: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire. 
And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he sha2l surely endow her to be his wife. 
If her father u2terly refuse to give her unto him, he sha2l pay money a2cording to the dowry of virgins. 
Thou shalt not su2fer a witch to live. 
Whosoever lieth with a beast sha2l surely be put to death. 
He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he sha2l be u2terly destroyed. 
Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor o2pre2s him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 
Ye sha2l not a2flict any widow, or fatherle2s child. 
If thou a2flict them in any wise, and they cry at a2l unto me, I wi2l surely hear their cry; 
And my wrath sha2l wax hot, and I wi2l ki2l you with the sword; and your wives sha2l be widows, and your children fatherle2s. 
If thou lend money to any of my people that is p2or by th2e, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury. 
If thou at a2l take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down: 
For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein sha2l he sl2ep? and it sha2l come to pa2s, when he crieth unto me, that I wi2l hear; for I am gracious. 
Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people. 
Thou shalt not delay to o2fer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me. 
Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sh2ep: seven days it sha2l be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me. 
And ye sha2l be holy men unto me: neither sha2l ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye sha2l cast it to the dogs. 
Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witne2s. 
Thou shalt not fo2low a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment: 
Neither shalt thou countenance a p2or man in his cause. 
If thou m2et thine enemy's ox or his a2s going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again. 
If thou s2e the a2s of him that hateth th2e lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him. 
Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy p2or in his cause. 
K2ep th2e far from a false ma2ter; and the i2nocent and righteous slay thou not: for I wi2l not justify the wicked. 
And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous. 
Also thou shalt not o2pre2s a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, s2eing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 
And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof: 
But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie sti2l; that the p2or of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field sha2l eat. In like ma2ner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard. 
Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine a2s may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed. 
And in a2l things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth. 
Thr2e times thou shalt k2ep a feast unto me in the year. 
Thou shalt k2ep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I co2manded th2e, in the time a2pointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none sha2l a2pear before me empty:) 
And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field. 
Thr2e items in the year a2l thy males sha2l a2pear before the LORD God. 
Thou shalt not o2fer the bl2od of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither sha2l the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning. 
The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not s2ethe a kid in his mother's milk. 
Behold, I send an Angel before th2e, to k2ep th2e in the way, and to bring th2e into the place which I have prepared. 
Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he wi2l not pardon your transgre2sions: for my name is in him. 
But if thou shalt ind2ed obey his voice, and do a2l that I speak; then I wi2l be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries. 
For mine Angel sha2l go before th2e, and bring th2e in unto the Amorites, and the Hi2tites, and the Peri2zites, and the Can2anites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I wi2l cut them o2f. 
Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt u2terly overthrow them, and quite break down their images. 
And ye sha2l serve the LORD your God, and he sha2l ble2s thy bread, and thy water; and I wi2l take sickne2s away from the midst of th2e. 
There sha2l nothing cast their young, nor be ba2ren, in thy land: the number of thy days I wi2l fulfil. 
I wi2l send my fear before th2e, and wi2l destroy a2l the people to whom thou shalt come, and I wi2l make a2l thine enemies turn their backs unto th2e. 
And I wi2l send hornets before th2e, which sha2l drive out the Hivite, the Can2anite, and the Hi2tite, from before th2e. 
I wi2l not drive them out from before th2e in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against th2e. 
By li2tle and li2tle I wi2l drive them out from before th2e, until thou be increased, and inherit the land. 
And I wi2l set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I wi2l deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before th2e. 
Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. 
They sha2l not dwe2l in thy land, lest they make th2e sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it wi2l surely be a snare unto th2e. 
And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar o2f. 
And Moses alone sha2l come near the LORD: but they sha2l not come nigh; neither sha2l the people go up with him. 
And Moses came and told the people a2l the words of the LORD, and a2l the judgments: and a2l the people answered with one voice, and said, A2l the words which the LORD hath said wi2l we do. 
And Moses wrote a2l the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hi2l, and twelve pi2lars, a2cording to the twelve tribes of Israel. 
And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which o2fered burnt o2ferings, and sacrificed peace o2ferings of oxen unto the LORD. 
And Moses t2ok half of the bl2od, and put it in basons; and half of the bl2od he sprinkled on the altar. 
And he t2ok the b2ok of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, A2l that the LORD hath said wi2l we do, and be obedient. 
And Moses t2ok the bl2od, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the bl2od of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning a2l these words. 
Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel: 
And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his f2et as it were a paved work of a sa2phire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearne2s. 
And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I wi2l give th2e tables of stone, and a law, and co2mandments which I have wri2ten; that thou mayest teach them. 
And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God. 
And he said unto the elders, Ta2ry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any ma2ters to do, let him come unto them. 
And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount. 
And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he ca2led unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. 
And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel. 
And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an o2fering: of every man that giveth it wi2lingly with his heart ye sha2l take my o2fering. 
And this is the o2fering which ye sha2l take of them; gold, and silver, and bra2s, 
And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, 
And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shi2tim w2od, 
Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sw2et incense, 
Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breastplate. 
And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwe2l among them. 
A2cording to a2l that I shew th2e, after the pa2tern of the tabernacle, and the pa2tern of a2l the instruments thereof, even so sha2l ye make it. 
And they sha2l make an ark of shi2tim w2od: two cubits and a half sha2l be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. 
And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about. 
And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings sha2l be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it. 
And thou shalt make staves of shi2tim w2od, and overlay them with gold. 
And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them. 
The staves sha2l be in the rings of the ark: they sha2l not be taken from it. 
And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I sha2l give th2e. 
And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half sha2l be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof. 
And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat. 
And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even of the mercy seat sha2l ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof. 
And the cherubims sha2l stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces sha2l l2ok one to another; toward the mercy seat sha2l the faces of the cherubims be. 
And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I sha2l give th2e. 
And there I wi2l m2et with th2e, and I wi2l co2mune with th2e from above the mercy seat, from betw2en the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony, of a2l things which I wi2l give th2e in co2mandment unto the children of Israel. 
Thou shalt also make a table of shi2tim w2od: two cubits sha2l be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. 
And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about. 
And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about. 
And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four f2et thereof. 
Over against the border sha2l the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table. 
And thou shalt make the staves of shi2tim w2od, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them. 
And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and sp2ons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of pure gold shalt thou make them. 
And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway. 
And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work sha2l the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, sha2l be of the same. 
And six branches sha2l come out of the sides of it; thr2e branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and thr2e branches of the candlestick out of the other side: 
Thr2e bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch; and thr2e bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick. 
And in the candlesticks sha2l be four bowls made like unto almonds, with their knops and their flowers. 
And there sha2l be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, a2cording to the six branches that proc2ed out of the candlestick. 
Their knops and their branches sha2l be of the same: a2l it sha2l be one beaten work of pure gold. 
And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they sha2l light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it. 
And the tongs thereof, and the snu2fdishes thereof, sha2l be of pure gold. 
Of a talent of pure gold sha2l he make it, with a2l these ve2sels. 
And l2ok that thou make them after their pa2tern, which was shewed th2e in the mount.

And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate. 
And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings which are on the ends of the breastplate. 
And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt fasten in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod before it. 
And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof, which is in the side of the ephod inward. 
And two other rings of gold thou shalt make, and shalt put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart thereof, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod. 
And they sha2l bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate be not l2osed from the ephod. 
And Aaron sha2l bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy place, for a memorial before the LORD continua2ly. 
And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thu2mim; and they sha2l be upon Aaron's heart, when he goeth in before the LORD: and Aaron sha2l bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the LORD continua2ly. 
And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod a2l of blue. 
And there sha2l be an hole in the top of it, in the midst thereof: it sha2l have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it, as it were the hole of an habergeon, that it be not rent. 
And beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem thereof; and be2ls of gold betw2en them round about: 
A golden be2l and a pomegranate, a golden be2l and a pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe round about. 
And it sha2l be upon Aaron to minister: and his sound sha2l be heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the LORD, and when he cometh out, that he die not. 
And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it, like the engravings of a signet, HOLINE2S TO THE LORD. 
And thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it sha2l be. 
And it sha2l be upon Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel sha2l ha2low in a2l their holy gifts; and it sha2l be always upon his forehead, that they may be a2cepted before the LORD. 
And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen, and thou shalt make the mitre of fine linen, and thou shalt make the girdle of n2edlework. 
And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt make for them girdles, and bo2nets shalt thou make for them, for glory and for beauty. 
And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's o2fice. 
And thou shalt make them linen br2eches to cover their nakedne2s; from the loins even unto the thighs they sha2l reach: 
And they sha2l be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they come in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place; that they bear not iniquity, and die: it sha2l be a statute for ever unto him and his s2ed after him. 
And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to ha2low them, to minister unto me in the priest's o2fice: Take one young bu2lock, and two rams without blemish, 
And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour shalt thou make them. 
And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bu2lock and the two rams. 
And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with water. 
And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod: 
And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre. 
Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his head, and anoint him. 
And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them. 
And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and put the bo2nets on them: and the priest's o2fice sha2l be theirs for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons. 
And thou shalt cause a bu2lock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons sha2l put their hands upon the head of the bu2lock. 
And thou shalt ki2l the bu2lock before the LORD, by the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
And thou shalt take of the bl2od of the bu2lock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour a2l the bl2od beside the bo2tom of the altar. 
And thou shalt take a2l the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar. 
But the flesh of the bu2lock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin o2fering. 
Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons sha2l put their hands upon the head of the ram. 
And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his bl2od, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar. 
And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his head. 
And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt o2fering unto the LORD: it is a sw2et savour, an o2fering made by fire unto the LORD. 
And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons sha2l put their hands upon the head of the ram. 
Then shalt thou ki2l the ram, and take of his bl2od, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right f2ot, and sprinkle the bl2od upon the altar round about. 
And thou shalt take of the bl2od that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he sha2l be ha2lowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him. 
Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration: 
And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the LORD: 
And thou shalt put a2l in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave o2fering before the LORD. 
And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon the altar for a burnt o2fering, for a sw2et savour before the LORD: it is an o2fering made by fire unto the LORD. 
And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration, and wave it for a wave o2fering before the LORD: and it sha2l be thy part. 
And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave o2fering, and the shoulder of the heave o2fering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons: 
And it sha2l be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is an heave o2fering: and it sha2l be an heave o2fering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace o2ferings, even their heave o2fering unto the LORD. 
And the holy garments of Aaron sha2l be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them. 
And that son that is priest in his stead sha2l put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place. 
And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and s2ethe his flesh in the holy place. 
And Aaron and his sons sha2l eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket by the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
And they sha2l eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger sha2l not eat thereof, because they are holy. 
And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it sha2l not be eaten, because it is holy. 
And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, a2cording to a2l things which I have co2manded th2e: seven days shalt thou consecrate them. 
And thou shalt o2fer every day a bu2lock for a sin o2fering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it. 
Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it sha2l be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar sha2l be holy. 
Now this is that which thou shalt o2fer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continua2ly. 
The one lamb thou shalt o2fer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt o2fer at even: 
And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink o2fering. 
And the other lamb thou shalt o2fer at even, and shalt do thereto a2cording to the meat o2fering of the morning, and a2cording to the drink o2fering thereof, for a sw2et savour, an o2fering made by fire unto the LORD. 
This sha2l be a continual burnt o2fering throughout your generations at the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I wi2l m2et you, to speak there unto th2e. 
And there I wi2l m2et with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle sha2l be sanctified by my glory. 
And I wi2l sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I wi2l sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's o2fice. 
And I wi2l dwe2l among the children of Israel, and wi2l be their God. 
And they sha2l know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwe2l among them: I am the LORD their God. 
And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shi2tim w2od shalt thou make it. 
A cubit sha2l be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare sha2l it be: and two cubits sha2l be the height thereof: the horns thereof sha2l be of the same. 
And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about. 
And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and they sha2l be for places for the staves to bear it withal. 
And thou shalt make the staves of shi2tim w2od, and overlay them with gold. 
And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I wi2l m2et with th2e. 
And Aaron sha2l burn thereon sw2et incense every morning: when he dre2seth the lamps, he sha2l burn incense upon it. 
And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he sha2l burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations. 
Ye sha2l o2fer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat o2fering; neither sha2l ye pour drink o2fering thereon. 
And Aaron sha2l make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the bl2od of the sin o2fering of atonements: once in the year sha2l he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto the LORD. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then sha2l they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them. 
This they sha2l give, every one that pa2seth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel sha2l be the o2fering of the LORD. 
Every one that pa2seth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, sha2l give an o2fering unto the LORD. 
The rich sha2l not give more, and the p2or sha2l not give le2s than half a shekel, when they give an o2fering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. 
And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt a2point it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Thou shalt also make a laver of bra2s, and his f2ot also of bra2s, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it betw2en the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein. 
For Aaron and his sons sha2l wash their hands and their f2et thereat: 
When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they sha2l wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn o2fering made by fire unto the LORD: 
So they sha2l wash their hands and their f2et, that they die not: and it sha2l be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his s2ed throughout their generations. 
Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Take thou also unto th2e principal spices, of pure my2rh five hundred shekels, and of sw2et ci2namon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sw2et calamus two hundred and fifty shekels, 
And of ca2sia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin: 
And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it sha2l be an holy anointing oil. 
And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony, 
And the table and a2l his ve2sels, and the candlestick and his ve2sels, and the altar of incense, 
And the altar of burnt o2fering with a2l his ve2sels, and the laver and his f2ot. 
And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them sha2l be holy. 
And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's o2fice. 
And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This sha2l be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations. 
Upon man's flesh sha2l it not be poured, neither sha2l ye make any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it sha2l be holy unto you. 
Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever pu2teth any of it upon a stranger, sha2l even be cut o2f from his people. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto th2e sw2et spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sw2et spices with pure frankincense: of each sha2l there be a like weight: 
And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy: 
And thou shalt beat some of it very sma2l, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I wi2l m2et with th2e: it sha2l be unto you most holy. 
And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye sha2l not make to yourselves a2cording to the composition thereof: it sha2l be unto th2e holy for the LORD. 
Whosoever sha2l make like unto that, to sme2l thereto, sha2l even be cut o2f from his people. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
S2e, I have ca2led by name Bezal2el the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: 
And I have fi2led him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in a2l ma2ner of workmanship, 
To devise cu2ning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in bra2s, 
And in cu2ting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in a2l ma2ner of workmanship. 
And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of a2l that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make a2l that I have co2manded th2e; 
The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and a2l the furniture of the tabernacle, 
And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with a2l his furniture, and the altar of incense, 
And the altar of burnt o2fering with a2l his furniture, and the laver and his f2ot, 
And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's o2fice, 
And the anointing oil, and sw2et incense for the holy place: a2cording to a2l that I have co2manded th2e sha2l they do. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sa2baths ye sha2l k2ep: for it is a sign betw2en me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you. 
Ye sha2l k2ep the sa2bath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it sha2l surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul sha2l be cut o2f from among his people. 
Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sa2bath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sa2bath day, he sha2l surely be put to death. 
Wherefore the children of Israel sha2l k2ep the sa2bath, to observe the sa2bath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. 
It is a sign betw2en me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. 
And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of co2muning with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, wri2ten with the finger of God. 
And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which sha2l go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. 
And Aaron said unto them, Break o2f the golden ea2rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me. 
And a2l the people brake o2f the golden ea2rings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron. 
And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving t2ol, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought th2e up out of the land of Egypt. 
And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To mo2row is a feast to the LORD. 
And they rose up early on the mo2row, and o2fered burnt o2ferings, and brought peace o2ferings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get th2e down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have co2rupted themselves: 
They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I co2manded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshi2ped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought th2e up out of the land of Egypt. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, I have s2en this people, and, behold, it is a sti2fnecked people: 
Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I wi2l make of th2e a great nation. 
And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand? 
Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. 
Remember Abraham, Is2ac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I wi2l multiply your s2ed as the stars of heaven, and a2l this land that I have spoken of wi2l I give unto your s2ed, and they sha2l inherit it for ever. 
And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people. 
And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were wri2ten on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they wri2ten. 
And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables. 
And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp. 
And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear. 
And it came to pa2s, as s2on as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount. 
And he t2ok the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it. 
And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto th2e, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them? 
And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief. 
For they said unto me, Make us gods, which sha2l go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. 
And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it o2f. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf. 
And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:) 
Then Moses st2od in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD's side? let him come unto me. And a2l the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him. 
And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour. 
And the children of Levi did a2cording to the word of Moses: and there fe2l of the people that day about thr2e thousand men. 
For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a ble2sing this day. 
And it came to pa2s on the mo2row, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have si2ned a great sin: and now I wi2l go up unto the LORD; peradventure I sha2l make an atonement for your sin. 
And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have si2ned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. 
Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin2-; and if not, blot me, I pray th2e, out of thy b2ok which thou hast wri2ten. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath si2ned against me, him wi2l I blot out of my b2ok. 
Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto th2e: behold, mine Angel sha2l go before th2e: neverthele2s in the day when I visit I wi2l visit their sin upon them. 
And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Is2ac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy s2ed wi2l I give it: 
And I wi2l send an angel before th2e; and I wi2l drive out the Can2anite, the Amorite, and the Hi2tite, and the Peri2zite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 
Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I wi2l not go up in the midst of th2e; for thou art a sti2fnecked people: lest I consume th2e in the way. 
And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments. 
For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a sti2fnecked people: I wi2l come up into the midst of th2e in a moment, and consume th2e: therefore now put o2f thy ornaments from th2e, that I may know what to do unto th2e. 
And the children of Israel stri2ped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb. 
And Moses t2ok the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar o2f from the camp, and ca2led it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pa2s, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp. 
And it came to pa2s, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that a2l the people rose up, and st2od every man at his tent d2or, and l2oked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle. 
And it came to pa2s, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pi2lar descended, and st2od at the d2or of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses. 
And a2l the people saw the cloudy pi2lar stand at the tabernacle d2or: and a2l the people rose up and worshi2ped, every man in his tent d2or. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle. 
And Moses said unto the LORD, S2e, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know th2e by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight. 
Now therefore, I pray th2e, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know th2e, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people. 
And he said, My presence sha2l go with th2e, and I wi2l give th2e rest. 
And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, ca2ry us not up hence. 
For wherein sha2l it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so sha2l we be separated, I and thy people, from a2l the people that are upon the face of the earth. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, I wi2l do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know th2e by name. 
And he said, I bes2ech th2e, shew me thy glory. 
And he said, I wi2l make a2l my g2odne2s pa2s before th2e, and I wi2l proclaim the name of the LORD before th2e; and wi2l be gracious to whom I wi2l be gracious, and wi2l shew mercy on whom I wi2l shew mercy. 
And he said, Thou canst not s2e my face: for there sha2l no man s2e me, and live. 
And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock: 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, while my glory pa2seth by, that I wi2l put th2e in a clift of the rock, and wi2l cover th2e with my hand while I pa2s by: 
And I wi2l take away mine hand, and thou shalt s2e my back parts: but my face sha2l not be s2en. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew th2e two tables of stone like unto the first: and I wi2l write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest. 
And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount. 
And no man sha2l come up with th2e, neither let any man be s2en throughout a2l the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds f2ed before that mount. 
And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had co2manded him, and t2ok in his hand the two tables of stone. 
And the LORD descended in the cloud, and st2od with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. 
And the LORD pa2sed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsu2fering, and abundant in g2odne2s and truth, 
K2eping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgre2sion and sin, and that wi2l by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation. 
And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshi2ped. 
And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray th2e, go among us; for it is a sti2fnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance. 
And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before a2l thy people I wi2l do marvels, such as have not b2en done in a2l the earth, nor in any nation: and a2l the people among which thou art sha2l s2e the work of the LORD: for it is a te2rible thing that I wi2l do with th2e. 
Observe thou that which I co2mand th2e this day: behold, I drive out before th2e the Amorite, and the Can2anite, and the Hi2tite, and the Peri2zite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
Take h2ed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of th2e: 
But ye sha2l destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves: 
For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God: 
Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one ca2l th2e, and thou eat of his sacrifice; 
And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods. 
Thou shalt make th2e no molten gods. 
The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou k2ep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I co2manded th2e, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt. 
A2l that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy ca2tle, whether ox or sh2ep, that is male. 
But the firstling of an a2s thou shalt red2em with a lamb: and if thou red2em him not, then shalt thou break his neck. A2l the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt red2em. And none sha2l a2pear before me empty. 
Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest. 
And thou shalt observe the feast of w2eks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end. 
Thrice in the year sha2l a2l your menchildren a2pear before the LORD God, the God of Israel. 
For I wi2l cast out the nations before th2e, and enlarge thy borders: neither sha2l any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to a2pear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year. 
Thou shalt not o2fer the bl2od of my sacrifice with leaven; neither sha2l the sacrifice of the feast of the pa2sover be left unto the morning. 
The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not s2ethe a kid in his mother's milk. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with th2e and with Israel. 
And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten co2mandments. 
And it came to pa2s, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him. 
And when Aaron and a2l the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him. 
And Moses ca2led unto them; and Aaron and a2l the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them. 
And afterward a2l the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in co2mandment a2l that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai. 
And ti2l Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face. 
But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he t2ok the vail o2f, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was co2manded. 
And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him. 
And Moses gathered a2l the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hath co2manded, that ye should do them. 
Six days sha2l work be done, but on the seventh day there sha2l be to you an holy day, a sa2bath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work therein sha2l be put to death. 
Ye sha2l kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sa2bath day. 
And Moses spake unto a2l the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD co2manded, saying, 
Take ye from among you an o2fering unto the LORD: whosoever is of a wi2ling heart, let him bring it, an o2fering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and bra2s, 
And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, 
And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shi2tim w2od, 
And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sw2et incense, 
And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate. 
And every wise hearted among you sha2l come, and make a2l that the LORD hath co2manded; 
The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pi2lars, and his sockets, 
The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the vail of the covering, 
The table, and his staves, and a2l his ve2sels, and the shewbread, 
The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light, 
And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil, and the sw2et incense, and the hanging for the d2or at the entering in of the tabernacle, 
The altar of burnt o2fering, with his brasen grate, his staves, and a2l his ve2sels, the laver and his f2ot, 
The hangings of the court, his pi2lars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the d2or of the court, 
The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords, 
The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's o2fice. 
And a2l the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. 
And they came, every one whose heart sti2red him up, and every one whom his spirit made wi2ling, and they brought the LORD's o2fering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for a2l his service, and for the holy garments. 
And they came, both men and women, as many as were wi2ling hearted, and brought bracelets, and ea2rings, and rings, and tablets, a2l jewels of gold: and every man that o2fered o2fered an o2fering of gold unto the LORD. 
And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them. 
Every one that did o2fer an o2fering of silver and bra2s brought the LORD's o2fering: and every man, with whom was found shi2tim w2od for any work of the service, brought it. 
And a2l the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen. 
And a2l the women whose heart sti2red them up in wisdom spun goats' hair. 
And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate; 
And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sw2et incense. 
The children of Israel brought a wi2ling o2fering unto the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them wi2ling to bring for a2l ma2ner of work, which the LORD had co2manded to be made by the hand of Moses. 
And Moses said unto the children of Israel, S2e, the LORD hath ca2led by name Bezal2el the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; 
And he hath fi2led him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in a2l ma2ner of workmanship; 
And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in bra2s, 
And in the cu2ting of stones, to set them, and in carving of w2od, to make any ma2ner of cu2ning work. 
And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 
Them hath he fi2led with wisdom of heart, to work a2l ma2ner of work, of the engraver, and of the cu2ning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise cu2ning work. 
Then wrought Bezal2el and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work a2l ma2ner of work for the service of the sanctuary, a2cording to a2l that the LORD had co2manded. 
And Moses ca2led Bezal2el and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart sti2red him up to come unto the work to do it: 
And they received of Moses a2l the o2fering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him fr2e o2ferings every morning. 
And a2l the wise men, that wrought a2l the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made; 
And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD co2manded to make. 
And Moses gave co2mandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the o2fering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing. 
For the stu2f they had was su2ficient for a2l the work to make it, and t2o much. 
And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cu2ning work made he them. 
The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were a2l of one size. 
And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another. 
And he made l2ops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the u2termost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second. 
Fifty l2ops made he in one curtain, and fifty l2ops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the l2ops held one curtain to another. 
And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle. 
And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them. 
The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size. 
And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. 
And he made fifty l2ops upon the u2termost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty l2ops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second. 
And he made fifty taches of bra2s to couple the tent together, that it might be one. 
And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers' skins above that. 
And he made boards for the tabernacle of shi2tim w2od, standing up. 
The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half. 
One board had two tenons, equa2ly distant one from another: thus did he make for a2l the boards of the tabernacle. 
And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward: 
And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons. 
And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards, 
And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. 
And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards. 
And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides. 
And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners. 
And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixt2en sockets of silver, under every board two sockets. 
And he made bars of shi2tim w2od; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, 
And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward. 
And he made the mi2dle bar to sh2ot through the boards from the one end to the other. 
And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold. 
And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cu2ning work. 
And he made thereunto four pi2lars of shi2tim w2od, and overlaid them with gold: their h2oks were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver. 
And he made an hanging for the tabernacle d2or of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of n2edlework; 
And the five pi2lars of it with their h2oks: and he overlaid their chapiters and their fi2lets with gold: but their five sockets were of bra2s. 
And Bezal2el made the ark of shi2tim w2od: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it: 
And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about. 
And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it. 
And he made staves of shi2tim w2od, and overlaid them with gold. 
And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark. 
And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof. 
And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat; 
One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof. 
And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims. 
And he made the table of shi2tim w2od: two cubits was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof: 
And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of gold round about. 
Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about. 
And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four f2et thereof. 
Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table. 
And he made the staves of shi2tim w2od, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table. 
And he made the ve2sels which were upon the table, his dishes, and his sp2ons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, of pure gold. 
And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, were of the same: 
And six branches going out of the sides thereof; thr2e branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and thr2e branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof: 
Thr2e bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knop and a flower; and thr2e bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick. 
And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his flowers: 
And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, a2cording to the six branches going out of it. 
Their knops and their branches were of the same: a2l of it was one beaten work of pure gold. 
And he made his seven lamps, and his snu2fers, and his snu2fdishes, of pure gold. 
Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and a2l the ve2sels thereof. 
And he made the incense altar of shi2tim w2od: the length of it was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was foursquare; and two cubits was the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same. 
And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a crown of gold round about. 
And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to bear it withal. 
And he made the staves of shi2tim w2od, and overlaid them with gold. 
And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sw2et spices, a2cording to the work of the apothecary. 
And he made the altar of burnt o2fering of shi2tim w2od: five cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; it was foursquare; and thr2e cubits the height thereof. 
And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with bra2s. 
And he made a2l the ve2sels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basons, and the fles2h2oks, and the firepans: a2l the ve2sels thereof made he of bra2s. 
And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compa2s thereof beneath unto the midst of it. 
And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of bra2s, to be places for the staves. 
And he made the staves of shi2tim w2od, and overlaid them with bra2s. 
And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear it withal; he made the altar ho2low with boards. 
And he made the laver of bra2s, and the f2ot of it of bra2s, of the l2okin2gla2ses of the women a2sembling, which a2sembled at the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred cubits: 
Their pi2lars were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty; the h2oks of the pi2lars and their fi2lets were of silver. 
And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits, their pi2lars were twenty, and their sockets of bra2s twenty; the h2oks of the pi2lars and their fi2lets of silver. 
And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pi2lars ten, and their sockets ten; the h2oks of the pi2lars and their fi2lets of silver. 
And for the east side eastward fifty cubits. 
The hangings of the one side of the gate were fift2en cubits; their pi2lars thr2e, and their sockets thr2e. 
And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that hand, were hangings of fift2en cubits; their pi2lars thr2e, and their sockets thr2e. 
A2l the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen. 
And the sockets for the pi2lars were of bra2s; the h2oks of the pi2lars and their fi2lets of silver; and the overlaying of their chapiters of silver; and a2l the pi2lars of the court were fi2leted with silver. 
And the hanging for the gate of the court was n2edlework, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court. 
And their pi2lars were four, and their sockets of bra2s four; their h2oks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fi2lets of silver. 
And a2l the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of bra2s. 
This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, a2cording to the co2mandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest. 
And Bezal2el the son Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made a2l that the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cu2ning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen. 
A2l the gold that was o2cupied for the work in a2l the work of the holy place, even the gold of the o2fering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 
And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and thr2escore and fift2en shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 
A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and thr2e thousand and five hundred and fifty men. 
And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket. 
And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made h2oks for the pi2lars, and overlaid their chapiters, and fi2leted them. 
And the bra2s of the o2fering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels. 
And therewith he made the sockets to the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate for it, and a2l the ve2sels of the altar, 
And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and a2l the pins of the tabernacle, and a2l the pins of the court round about. 
And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 
And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cu2ning work. 
They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the two edges was it coupled together. 
And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same, a2cording to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel. 
And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And he made the breastplate of cu2ning work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 
It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled. 
And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row. 
And the second row, an emerald, a sa2phire, and a diamond. 
And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst. 
And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings. 
And the stones were a2cording to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, a2cording to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, a2cording to the twelve tribes. 
And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen work of pure gold. 
And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate. 
And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate. 
And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it. 
And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward. 
And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod. 
And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be l2osed from the ephod; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, a2l of blue. 
And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend. 
And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen. 
And they made be2ls of pure gold, and put the be2ls betw2en the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about betw2en the pomegranates; 
A be2l and a pomegranate, a be2l and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons, 
And a mitre of fine linen, and g2odly bo2nets of fine linen, and linen br2eches of fine twined linen, 
And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of n2edlework; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINE2S TO THE LORD. 
And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the mitre; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
Thus was a2l the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did a2cording to a2l that the LORD co2manded Moses, so did they. 
And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and a2l his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pi2lars, and his sockets, 
And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering, 
The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat, 
The table, and a2l the ve2sels thereof, and the shewbread, 
The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to be set in order, and a2l the ve2sels thereof, and the oil for light, 
And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sw2et incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle d2or, 
The brasen altar, and his grate of bra2s, his staves, and a2l his ve2sels, the laver and his f2ot, 
The hangings of the court, his pi2lars, and his sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and a2l the ve2sels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation, 
The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's o2fice. 
A2cording to a2l that the LORD co2manded Moses, so the children of Israel made a2l the work. 
And Moses did l2ok upon a2l the work, and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had co2manded, even so had they done it: and Moses ble2sed them. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. 
And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail. 
And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof. 
And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the d2or to the tabernacle. 
And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt o2fering before the d2or of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. 
And thou shalt set the laver betw2en the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein. 
And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate. 
And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and a2l that is therein, and shalt ha2low it, and a2l the ve2sels thereof: and it sha2l be holy. 
And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt o2fering, and a2l his ve2sels, and sanctify the altar: and it sha2l be an altar most holy. 
And thou shalt anoint the laver and his f2ot, and sanctify it. 
And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water. 
And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's o2fice. 
And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: 
And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's o2fice: for their anointing sha2l surely be an everlasting priesth2od throughout their generations. 
Thus did Moses: a2cording to a2l that the LORD co2manded him, so did he. 
And it came to pa2s in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up. 
And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pi2lars. 
And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And he t2ok and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: 
And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail. 
And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had co2manded Moses. 
And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. 
And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail: 
And he burnt sw2et incense thereon; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And he set up the hanging at the d2or of the tabernacle. 
And he put the altar of burnt o2fering by the d2or of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and o2fered upon it the burnt o2fering and the meat o2fering; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And he set the laver betw2en the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal. 
And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their f2et thereat: 
When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work. 
Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD fi2led the tabernacle. 
And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD fi2led the tabernacle. 
And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in a2l their journeys: 
But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not ti2l the day that it was taken up. 
For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of a2l the house of Israel, throughout a2l their journeys. 
And the LORD ca2led unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an o2fering unto the LORD, ye sha2l bring your o2fering of the ca2tle, even of the herd, and of the flock. 
If his o2fering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him o2fer a male without blemish: he sha2l o2fer it of his own voluntary wi2l at the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD. 
And he sha2l put his hand upon the head of the burnt o2fering; and it sha2l be a2cepted for him to make atonement for him. 
And he sha2l ki2l the bu2lock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, sha2l bring the bl2od, and sprinkle the bl2od round about upon the altar that is by the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
And he sha2l flay the burnt o2fering, and cut it into his pieces. 
And the sons of Aaron the priest sha2l put fire upon the altar, and lay the w2od in order upon the fire: 
And the priests, Aaron's sons, sha2l lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the w2od that is on the fire which is upon the altar: 
But his inwards and his legs sha2l he wash in water: and the priest sha2l burn a2l on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an o2fering made by fire, of a sw2et savour unto the LORD. 
And if his o2fering be of the flocks, namely, of the sh2ep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he sha2l bring it a male without blemish. 
And he sha2l ki2l it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, sha2l sprinkle his bl2od round about upon the altar. 
And he sha2l cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest sha2l lay them in order on the w2od that is on the fire which is upon the altar: 
But he sha2l wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest sha2l bring it a2l, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an o2fering made by fire, of a sw2et savour unto the LORD. 
And if the burnt sacrifice for his o2fering to the LORD be of fowls, then he sha2l bring his o2fering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons. 
And the priest sha2l bring it unto the altar, and wring o2f his head, and burn it on the altar; and the bl2od thereof sha2l be wrung out at the side of the altar: 
And he sha2l pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes: 
And he sha2l cleave it with the wings thereof, but sha2l not divide it asunder: and the priest sha2l burn it upon the altar, upon the w2od that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an o2fering made by fire, of a sw2et savour unto the LORD. 
And when any wi2l o2fer a meat o2fering unto the LORD, his o2fering sha2l be of fine flour; and he sha2l pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon: 
And he sha2l bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he sha2l take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with a2l the frankincense thereof; and the priest sha2l burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an o2fering made by fire, of a sw2et savour unto the LORD: 
And the remnant of the meat o2fering sha2l be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the o2ferings of the LORD made by fire. 
And if thou bring an oblation of a meat o2fering baken in the oven, it sha2l be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil. 
And if thy oblation be a meat o2fering baken in a pan, it sha2l be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil. 
Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat o2fering. 
And if thy oblation be a meat o2fering baken in the fryingpan, it sha2l be made of fine flour with oil. 
And thou shalt bring the meat o2fering that is made of these things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he sha2l bring it unto the altar. 
And the priest sha2l take from the meat o2fering a memorial thereof, and sha2l burn it upon the altar: it is an o2fering made by fire, of a sw2et savour unto the LORD. 
And that which is left of the meat o2fering sha2l be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the o2ferings of the LORD made by fire. 
No meat o2fering, which ye sha2l bring unto the LORD, sha2l be made with leaven: for ye sha2l burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any o2fering of the LORD made by fire. 
As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye sha2l o2fer them unto the LORD: but they sha2l not be burnt on the altar for a sw2et savour. 
And every oblation of thy meat o2fering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou su2fer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat o2fering: with a2l thine o2ferings thou shalt o2fer salt. 
And if thou o2fer a meat o2fering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD, thou shalt o2fer for the meat o2fering of thy firstfruits gr2en ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of fu2l ears. 
And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meat o2fering. 
And the priest sha2l burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with a2l the frankincense thereof: it is an o2fering made by fire unto the LORD. 
And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace o2fering, if he o2fer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he sha2l o2fer it without blemish before the LORD. 
And he sha2l lay his hand upon the head of his o2fering, and ki2l it at the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons the priests sha2l sprinkle the bl2od upon the altar round about. 
And he sha2l o2fer of the sacrifice of the peace o2fering an o2fering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and a2l the fat that is upon the inwards, 
And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it sha2l he take away. 
And Aaron's sons sha2l burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice, which is upon the w2od that is on the fire: it is an o2fering made by fire, of a sw2et savour unto the LORD. 
And if his o2fering for a sacrifice of peace o2fering unto the LORD be of the flock; male or female, he sha2l o2fer it without blemish. 
If he o2fer a lamb for his o2fering, then sha2l he o2fer it before the LORD. 
And he sha2l lay his hand upon the head of his o2fering, and ki2l it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons sha2l sprinkle the bl2od thereof round about upon the altar. 
And he sha2l o2fer of the sacrifice of the peace o2fering an o2fering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the whole rump, it sha2l he take o2f hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and a2l the fat that is upon the inwards, 
And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it sha2l he take away. 
And the priest sha2l burn it upon the altar: it is the f2od of the o2fering made by fire unto the LORD. 
And if his o2fering be a goat, then he sha2l o2fer it before the LORD. 
And he sha2l lay his hand upon the head of it, and ki2l it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron sha2l sprinkle the bl2od thereof upon the altar round about. 
And he sha2l o2fer thereof his o2fering, even an o2fering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and a2l the fat that is upon the inwards, 
And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it sha2l he take away. 
And the priest sha2l burn them upon the altar: it is the f2od of the o2fering made by fire for a sw2et savour: a2l the fat is the LORD's. 
It sha2l be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout a2l your dwe2lings, that ye eat neither fat nor bl2od. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul sha2l sin through ignorance against any of the co2mandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and sha2l do against any of them: 
If the priest that is anointed do sin a2cording to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath si2ned, a young bu2lock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin o2fering. 
And he sha2l bring the bu2lock unto the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and sha2l lay his hand upon the bu2lock's head, and ki2l the bu2lock before the LORD. 
And the priest that is anointed sha2l take of the bu2lock's bl2od, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation: 
And the priest sha2l dip his finger in the bl2od, and sprinkle of the bl2od seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary. 
And the priest sha2l put some of the bl2od upon the horns of the altar of sw2et incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and sha2l pour a2l the bl2od of the bu2lock at the bo2tom of the altar of the burnt o2fering, which is at the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
And he sha2l take o2f from it a2l the fat of the bu2lock for the sin o2fering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and a2l the fat that is upon the inwards, 
And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it sha2l he take away, 
As it was taken o2f from the bu2lock of the sacrifice of peace o2ferings: and the priest sha2l burn them upon the altar of the burnt o2fering. 
And the skin of the bu2lock, and a2l his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, 
Even the whole bu2lock sha2l he ca2ry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the w2od with fire: where the ashes are poured out sha2l he be burnt. 
And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the a2sembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the co2mandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty; 
When the sin, which they have si2ned against it, is known, then the congregation sha2l o2fer a young bu2lock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation. 
And the elders of the congregation sha2l lay their hands upon the head of the bu2lock before the LORD: and the bu2lock sha2l be ki2led before the LORD. 
And the priest that is anointed sha2l bring of the bu2lock's bl2od to the tabernacle of the congregation: 
And the priest sha2l dip his finger in some of the bl2od, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail. 
And he sha2l put some of the bl2od upon the horns of the altar which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and sha2l pour out a2l the bl2od at the bo2tom of the altar of the burnt o2fering, which is at the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
And he sha2l take a2l his fat from him, and burn it upon the altar. 
And he sha2l do with the bu2lock as he did with the bu2lock for a sin o2fering, so sha2l he do with this: and the priest sha2l make an atonement for them, and it sha2l be forgiven them. 
And he sha2l ca2ry forth the bu2lock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bu2lock: it is a sin o2fering for the congregation. 
When a ruler hath si2ned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the co2mandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty; 
Or if his sin, wherein he hath si2ned, come to his knowledge; he sha2l bring his o2fering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish: 
And he sha2l lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and ki2l it in the place where they ki2l the burnt o2fering before the LORD: it is a sin o2fering. 
And the priest sha2l take of the bl2od of the sin o2fering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt o2fering, and sha2l pour out his bl2od at the bo2tom of the altar of burnt o2fering. 
And he sha2l burn a2l his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace o2ferings: and the priest sha2l make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it sha2l be forgiven him. 
And if any one of the co2mon people sin through ignorance, while he doeth somewhat against any of the co2mandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty; 
Or if his sin, which he hath si2ned, come to his knowledge: then he sha2l bring his o2fering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath si2ned. 
And he sha2l lay his hand upon the head of the sin o2fering, and slay the sin o2fering in the place of the burnt o2fering. 
And the priest sha2l take of the bl2od thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt o2fering, and sha2l pour out a2l the bl2od thereof at the bo2tom of the altar. 
And he sha2l take away a2l the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from o2f the sacrifice of peace o2ferings; and the priest sha2l burn it upon the altar for a sw2et savour unto the LORD; and the priest sha2l make an atonement for him, and it sha2l be forgiven him. 
And if he bring a lamb for a sin o2fering, he sha2l bring it a female without blemish. 
And he sha2l lay his hand upon the head of the sin o2fering, and slay it for a sin o2fering in the place where they ki2l the burnt o2fering. 
And the priest sha2l take of the bl2od of the sin o2fering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt o2fering, and sha2l pour out a2l the bl2od thereof at the bo2tom of the altar: 
And he sha2l take away a2l the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace o2ferings; and the priest sha2l burn them upon the altar, a2cording to the o2ferings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest sha2l make an atonement for his sin that he hath co2mi2ted, and it sha2l be forgiven him. 
And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witne2s, whether he hath s2en or known of it; if he do not u2ter it, then he sha2l bear his iniquity. 
Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean ca2tle, or the carcase of unclean cr2eping things, and if it be hi2den from him; he also sha2l be unclean, and guilty. 
Or if he touch the unclea2ne2s of man, whatsoever unclea2ne2s it be that a man sha2l be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he sha2l be guilty. 
Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do g2od, whatsoever it be that a man sha2l pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he sha2l be guilty in one of these. 
And it sha2l be, when he sha2l be guilty in one of these things, that he sha2l confe2s that he hath si2ned in that thing: 
And he sha2l bring his trespa2s o2fering unto the LORD for his sin which he hath si2ned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a sin o2fering; and the priest sha2l make an atonement for him concerning his sin. 
And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he sha2l bring for his trespa2s, which he hath co2mi2ted, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin o2fering, and the other for a burnt o2fering. 
And he sha2l bring them unto the priest, who sha2l o2fer that which is for the sin o2fering first, and wring o2f his head from his neck, but sha2l not divide it asunder: 
And he sha2l sprinkle of the bl2od of the sin o2fering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the bl2od sha2l be wrung out at the bo2tom of the altar: it is a sin o2fering. 
And he sha2l o2fer the second for a burnt o2fering, a2cording to the ma2ner: and the priest sha2l make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath si2ned, and it sha2l be forgiven him. 
But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he that si2ned sha2l bring for his o2fering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin o2fering; he sha2l put no oil upon it, neither sha2l he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a sin o2fering. 
Then sha2l he bring it to the priest, and the priest sha2l take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, a2cording to the o2ferings made by fire unto the LORD: it is a sin o2fering. 
And the priest sha2l make an atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath si2ned in one of these, and it sha2l be forgiven him: and the remnant sha2l be the priest's, as a meat o2fering. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
If a soul co2mit a trespa2s, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD; then he sha2l bring for his trespa2s unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespa2s o2fering. 
And he sha2l make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and sha2l a2d the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest: and the priest sha2l make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespa2s o2fering, and it sha2l be forgiven him. 
And if a soul sin, and co2mit any of these things which are forbi2den to be done by the co2mandments of the LORD; though he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and sha2l bear his iniquity. 
And he sha2l bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespa2s o2fering, unto the priest: and the priest sha2l make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he e2red and wist it not, and it sha2l be forgiven him. 
It is a trespa2s o2fering: he hath certainly trespa2sed against the LORD. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
If a soul sin, and co2mit a trespa2s against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to k2ep, or in fe2lowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour; 
Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of a2l these that a man doeth, si2ning therein: 
Then it sha2l be, because he hath si2ned, and is guilty, that he sha2l restore that which he t2ok violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfu2ly go2ten, or that which was delivered him to k2ep, or the lost thing which he found, 
Or a2l that about which he hath sworn falsely; he sha2l even restore it in the principal, and sha2l a2d the fifth part more thereto, and give it unto him to whom it a2pertaineth, in the day of his trespa2s o2fering. 
And he sha2l bring his trespa2s o2fering unto the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespa2s o2fering, unto the priest: 
And the priest sha2l make an atonement for him before the LORD: and it sha2l be forgiven him for any thing of a2l that he hath done in trespa2sing therein. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Co2mand Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt o2fering: It is the burnt o2fering, because of the burning upon the altar a2l night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar sha2l be burning in it. 
And the priest sha2l put on his linen garment, and his linen br2eches sha2l he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt o2fering on the altar, and he sha2l put them beside the altar. 
And he sha2l put o2f his garments, and put on other garments, and ca2ry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place. 
And the fire upon the altar sha2l be burning in it; it sha2l not be put out: and the priest sha2l burn w2od on it every morning, and lay the burnt o2fering in order upon it; and he sha2l burn thereon the fat of the peace o2ferings. 
The fire sha2l ever be burning upon the altar; it sha2l never go out. 
And this is the law of the meat o2fering: the sons of Aaron sha2l o2fer it before the LORD, before the altar. 
And he sha2l take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat o2fering, and of the oil thereof, and a2l the frankincense which is upon the meat o2fering, and sha2l burn it upon the altar for a sw2et savour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD. 
And the remainder thereof sha2l Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread sha2l it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they sha2l eat it. 
It sha2l not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for their portion of my o2ferings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the sin o2fering, and as the trespa2s o2fering. 
A2l the males among the children of Aaron sha2l eat of it. It sha2l be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the o2ferings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them sha2l be holy. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
This is the o2fering of Aaron and of his sons, which they sha2l o2fer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat o2fering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night. 
In a pan it sha2l be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat o2fering shalt thou o2fer for a sw2et savour unto the LORD. 
And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead sha2l o2fer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it sha2l be who2ly burnt. 
For every meat o2fering for the priest sha2l be who2ly burnt: it sha2l not be eaten. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin o2fering: In the place where the burnt o2fering is ki2led sha2l the sin o2fering be ki2led before the LORD: it is most holy. 
The priest that o2fereth it for sin sha2l eat it: in the holy place sha2l it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
Whatsoever sha2l touch the flesh thereof sha2l be holy: and when there is sprinkled of the bl2od thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place. 
But the earthen ve2sel wherein it is so2den sha2l be broken: and if it be so2den in a brasen pot, it sha2l be both scoured, and rinsed in water. 
A2l the males among the priests sha2l eat thereof: it is most holy. 
And no sin o2fering, whereof any of the bl2od is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place, sha2l be eaten: it sha2l be burnt in the fire. 
Likewise this is the law of the trespa2s o2fering: it is most holy. 
In the place where they ki2l the burnt o2fering sha2l they ki2l the trespa2s o2fering: and the bl2od thereof sha2l he sprinkle round about upon the altar. 
And he sha2l o2fer of it a2l the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, 
And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it sha2l he take away: 
And the priest sha2l burn them upon the altar for an o2fering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespa2s o2fering. 
Every male among the priests sha2l eat thereof: it sha2l be eaten in the holy place: it is most holy. 
As the sin o2fering is, so is the trespa2s o2fering: there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith sha2l have it. 
And the priest that o2fereth any man's burnt o2fering, even the priest sha2l have to himself the skin of the burnt o2fering which he hath o2fered. 
And a2l the meat o2fering that is baken in the oven, and a2l that is dre2sed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, sha2l be the priest's that o2fereth it. 
And every meat o2fering, mingled with oil, and dry, sha2l a2l the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another. 
And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace o2ferings, which he sha2l o2fer unto the LORD. 
If he o2fer it for a thanksgiving, then he sha2l o2fer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried. 
Besides the cakes, he sha2l o2fer for his o2fering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace o2ferings. 
And of it he sha2l o2fer one out of the whole oblation for an heave o2fering unto the LORD, and it sha2l be the priest's that sprinkleth the bl2od of the peace o2ferings. 
And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace o2ferings for thanksgiving sha2l be eaten the same day that it is o2fered; he sha2l not leave any of it until the morning. 
But if the sacrifice of his o2fering be a vow, or a voluntary o2fering, it sha2l be eaten the same day that he o2fereth his sacrifice: and on the mo2row also the remainder of it sha2l be eaten: 
But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day sha2l be burnt with fire. 
And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace o2ferings be eaten at a2l on the third day, it sha2l not be a2cepted, neither sha2l it be imputed unto him that o2fereth it: it sha2l be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it sha2l bear his iniquity. 
And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing sha2l not be eaten; it sha2l be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, a2l that be clean sha2l eat thereof. 
But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace o2ferings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his unclea2ne2s upon him, even that soul sha2l be cut o2f from his people. 
Moreover the soul that sha2l touch any unclean thing, as the unclea2ne2s of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace o2ferings, which pertain unto the LORD, even that soul sha2l be cut o2f from his people. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye sha2l eat no ma2ner of fat, of ox, or of sh2ep, or of goat. 
And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye sha2l in no wise eat of it. 
For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men o2fer an o2fering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it sha2l be cut o2f from his people. 
Moreover ye sha2l eat no ma2ner of bl2od, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwe2lings. 
Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any ma2ner of bl2od, even that soul sha2l be cut o2f from his people. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that o2fereth the sacrifice of his peace o2ferings unto the LORD sha2l bring his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace o2ferings. 
His own hands sha2l bring the o2ferings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it sha2l he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave o2fering before the LORD. 
And the priest sha2l burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast sha2l be Aaron's and his sons'. 
And the right shoulder sha2l ye give unto the priest for an heave o2fering of the sacrifices of your peace o2ferings. 
He among the sons of Aaron, that o2fereth the bl2od of the peace o2ferings, and the fat, sha2l have the right shoulder for his part. 
For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from o2f the sacrifices of their peace o2ferings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel. 
This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the o2ferings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest's o2fice; 
Which the LORD co2manded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations. 
This is the law of the burnt o2fering, of the meat o2fering, and of the sin o2fering, and of the trespa2s o2fering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace o2ferings; 
Which the LORD co2manded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he co2manded the children of Israel to o2fer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderne2s of Sinai. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bu2lock for the sin o2fering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread; 
And gather thou a2l the congregation together unto the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
And Moses did as the LORD co2manded him; and the a2sembly was gathered together unto the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the LORD co2manded to be done. 
And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water. 
And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith. 
And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thu2mim. 
And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And Moses t2ok the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and a2l that was therein, and sanctified them. 
And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and a2l his ve2sels, both the laver and his f2ot, to sanctify them. 
And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him. 
And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bo2nets upon them; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And he brought the bu2lock for the sin o2fering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bu2lock for the sin o2fering. 
And he slew it; and Moses t2ok the bl2od, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the bl2od at the bo2tom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it. 
And he t2ok a2l the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar. 
But the bu2lock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And he brought the ram for the burnt o2fering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 
And he ki2led it; and Moses sprinkled the bl2od upon the altar round about. 
And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat. 
And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sw2et savour, and an o2fering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 
And he slew it; and Moses t2ok of the bl2od of it, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right f2ot. 
And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the bl2od upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right f2et: and Moses sprinkled the bl2od upon the altar round about. 
And he t2ok the fat, and the rump, and a2l the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder: 
And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he t2ok one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right shoulder: 
And he put a2l upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave o2fering before the LORD. 
And Moses t2ok them from o2f their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt o2fering: they were consecrations for a sw2et savour: it is an o2fering made by fire unto the LORD. 
And Moses t2ok the breast, and waved it for a wave o2fering before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And Moses t2ok of the anointing oil, and of the bl2od which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him. 
And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I co2manded, saying, Aaron and his sons sha2l eat it. 
And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread sha2l ye burn with fire. 
And ye sha2l not go out of the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days sha2l he consecrate you. 
As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath co2manded to do, to make an atonement for you. 
Therefore sha2l ye abide at the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and k2ep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am co2manded. 
So Aaron and his sons did a2l things which the LORD co2manded by the hand of Moses. 
And it came to pa2s on the eighth day, that Moses ca2led Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel; 
And he said unto Aaron, Take th2e a young calf for a sin o2fering, and a ram for a burnt o2fering, without blemish, and o2fer them before the LORD. 
And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin o2fering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt o2fering; 
Also a bu2lock and a ram for peace o2ferings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat o2fering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD wi2l a2pear unto you. 
And they brought that which Moses co2manded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and a2l the congregation drew near and st2od before the LORD. 
And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD co2manded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD sha2l a2pear unto you. 
And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and o2fer thy sin o2fering, and thy burnt o2fering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and o2fer the o2fering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD co2manded. 
Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin o2fering, which was for himself. 
And the sons of Aaron brought the bl2od unto him: and he di2ped his finger in the bl2od, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the bl2od at the bo2tom of the altar: 
But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin o2fering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp. 
And he slew the burnt o2fering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the bl2od, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar. 
And they presented the burnt o2fering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar. 
And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt o2fering on the altar. 
And he brought the people's o2fering, and t2ok the goat, which was the sin o2fering for the people, and slew it, and o2fered it for sin, as the first. 
And he brought the burnt o2fering, and o2fered it a2cording to the ma2ner. 
And he brought the meat o2fering, and t2ok an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning. 
He slew also the bu2lock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace o2ferings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the bl2od, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about, 
And the fat of the bu2lock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver: 
And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar: 
And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave o2fering before the LORD; as Moses co2manded. 
And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and ble2sed them, and came down from o2fering of the sin o2fering, and the burnt o2fering, and peace o2ferings. 
And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and ble2sed the people: and the glory of the LORD a2peared unto a2l the people. 
And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt o2fering and the fat: which when a2l the people saw, they shouted, and fe2l on their faces. 
And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, t2ok either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and o2fered strange fire before the LORD, which he co2manded them not. 
And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD. 
Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake, saying, I wi2l be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before a2l the people I wi2l be glorified. And Aaron held his peace. 
And Moses ca2led Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of U2ziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, ca2ry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp. 
So they went near, and ca2ried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said. 
And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon a2l the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled. 
And ye sha2l not go out from the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you. And they did a2cording to the word of Moses. 
And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying, 
Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with th2e, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it sha2l be a statute for ever throughout your generations: 
And that ye may put di2ference betw2en holy and unholy, and betw2en unclean and clean; 
And that ye may teach the children of Israel a2l the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses. 
And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat o2fering that remaineth of the o2ferings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy: 
And ye sha2l eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am co2manded. 
And the wave breast and heave shoulder sha2l ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with th2e: for they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace o2ferings of the children of Israel. 
The heave shoulder and the wave breast sha2l they bring with the o2ferings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave o2fering before the LORD; and it sha2l be thine, and thy sons' with th2e, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath co2manded. 
And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin o2fering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying, 
Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin o2fering in the holy place, s2eing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD? 
Behold, the bl2od of it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should ind2ed have eaten it in the holy place, as I co2manded. 
And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they o2fered their sin o2fering and their burnt o2fering before the LORD; and such things have befa2len me: and if I had eaten the sin o2fering to day, should it have b2en a2cepted in the sight of the LORD? 
And when Moses heard that, he was content. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye sha2l eat among a2l the beasts that are on the earth. 
Whatsoever parteth the h2of, and is clovenf2oted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that sha2l ye eat. 
Neverthele2s these sha2l ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the h2of: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the h2of; he is unclean unto you. 
And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the h2of; he is unclean unto you. 
And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the h2of; he is unclean unto you. 
And the swine, though he divide the h2of, and be clovenf2oted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you. 
Of their flesh sha2l ye not eat, and their carcase sha2l ye not touch; they are unclean to you. 
These sha2l ye eat of a2l that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them sha2l ye eat. 
And a2l that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of a2l that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they sha2l be an abomination unto you: 
They sha2l be even an abomination unto you; ye sha2l not eat of their flesh, but ye sha2l have their carcases in abomination. 
Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that sha2l be an abomination unto you. 
And these are they which ye sha2l have in abomination among the fowls; they sha2l not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the o2sifrage, and the ospray, 
And the vulture, and the kite after his kind; 
Every raven after his kind; 
And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, 
And the li2tle owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl, 
And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle, 
And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat. 
A2l fowls that cr2ep, going upon a2l four, sha2l be an abomination unto you. 
Yet these may ye eat of every flying cr2eping thing that goeth upon a2l four, which have legs above their f2et, to leap withal upon the earth; 
Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the b2etle after his kind, and the gra2sho2per after his kind. 
But a2l other flying cr2eping things, which have four f2et, sha2l be an abomination unto you. 
And for these ye sha2l be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them sha2l be unclean until the even. 
And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them sha2l wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even. 
The carcases of every beast which divideth the h2of, and is not clovenf2oted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them sha2l be unclean. 
And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among a2l ma2ner of beasts that go on a2l four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase sha2l be unclean until the even. 
And he that beareth the carcase of them sha2l wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you. 
These also sha2l be unclean unto you among the cr2eping things that cr2ep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind, 
And the fe2ret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole. 
These are unclean to you among a2l that cr2ep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, sha2l be unclean until the even. 
And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fa2l, it sha2l be unclean; whether it be any ve2sel of w2od, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever ve2sel it be, wherein any work is done, it must be put into water, and it sha2l be unclean until the even; so it sha2l be cleansed. 
And every earthen ve2sel, whereinto any of them fa2leth, whatsoever is in it sha2l be unclean; and ye sha2l break it. 
Of a2l meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh sha2l be unclean: and a2l drink that may be drunk in every such ve2sel sha2l be unclean. 
And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase fa2leth sha2l be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they sha2l be broken down: for they are unclean and sha2l be unclean unto you. 
Neverthele2s a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of water, sha2l be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase sha2l be unclean. 
And if any part of their carcase fa2l upon any sowing s2ed which is to be sown, it sha2l be clean. 
But if any water be put upon the s2ed, and any part of their carcase fa2l thereon, it sha2l be unclean unto you. 
And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof sha2l be unclean until the even. 
And he that eateth of the carcase of it sha2l wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it sha2l wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even. 
And every cr2eping thing that cr2epeth upon the earth sha2l be an abomination; it sha2l not be eaten. 
Whatsoever goeth upon the be2ly, and whatsoever goeth upon a2l four, or whatsoever hath more f2et among a2l cr2eping things that cr2ep upon the earth, them ye sha2l not eat; for they are an abomination. 
Ye sha2l not make yourselves abominable with any cr2eping thing that cr2epeth, neither sha2l ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby. 
For I am the LORD your God: ye sha2l therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye sha2l be holy; for I am holy: neither sha2l ye defile yourselves with any ma2ner of cr2eping thing that cr2epeth upon the earth. 
For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye sha2l therefore be holy, for I am holy. 
This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that cr2epeth upon the earth: 
To make a di2ference betw2en the unclean and the clean, and betw2en the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived s2ed, and born a man child: then she sha2l be unclean seven days; a2cording to the days of the separation for her infirmity sha2l she be unclean. 
And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin sha2l be circumcised. 
And she sha2l then continue in the bl2od of her purifying thr2e and thirty days; she sha2l touch no ha2lowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfi2led. 
But if she bear a maid child, then she sha2l be unclean two w2eks, as in her separation: and she sha2l continue in the bl2od of her purifying thr2escore and six days. 
And when the days of her purifying are fulfi2led, for a son, or for a daughter, she sha2l bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt o2fering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin o2fering, unto the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest: 
Who sha2l o2fer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and she sha2l be cleansed from the i2sue of her bl2od. This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female. 
And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she sha2l bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt o2fering, and the other for a sin o2fering: and the priest sha2l make an atonement for her, and she sha2l be clean. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, 
When a man sha2l have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he sha2l be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests: 
And the priest sha2l l2ok on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be d2eper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest sha2l l2ok on him, and pronounce him unclean. 
If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be not d2eper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest sha2l shut up him that hath the plague seven days: 
And the priest sha2l l2ok on him the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest sha2l shut him up seven days more: 
And the priest sha2l l2ok on him again the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in the skin, the priest sha2l pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and he sha2l wash his clothes, and be clean. 
But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath b2en s2en of the priest for his cleansing, he sha2l be s2en of the priest again. 
And if the priest s2e that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest sha2l pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy. 
When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he sha2l be brought unto the priest; 
And the priest sha2l s2e him: and, behold, if the rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising; 
It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest sha2l pronounce him unclean, and sha2l not shut him up: for he is unclean. 
And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover a2l the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his f2ot, wheresoever the priest l2oketh; 
Then the priest sha2l consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered a2l his flesh, he sha2l pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is a2l turned white: he is clean. 
But when raw flesh a2peareth in him, he sha2l be unclean. 
And the priest sha2l s2e the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy. 
Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he sha2l come unto the priest; 
And the priest sha2l s2e him: and, behold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest sha2l pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean. 
The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed, 
And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat re2dish, and it be shewed to the priest; 
And if, when the priest s2eth it, behold, it be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest sha2l pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil. 
But if the priest l2ok on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest sha2l shut him up seven days: 
And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest sha2l pronounce him unclean: it is a plague. 
But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is a burning boil; and the priest sha2l pronounce him clean. 
Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat re2dish, or white; 
Then the priest sha2l l2ok upon it: and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight d2eper than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest sha2l pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy. 
But if the priest l2ok on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest sha2l shut him up seven days: 
And the priest sha2l l2ok upon him the seventh day: and if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest sha2l pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy. 
And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the priest sha2l pronounce him clean: for it is an infla2mation of the burning. 
If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard; 
Then the priest sha2l s2e the plague: and, behold, if it be in sight d2eper than the skin; and there be in it a ye2low thin hair; then the priest sha2l pronounce him unclean: it is a dry sca2l, even a leprosy upon the head or beard. 
And if the priest l2ok on the plague of the sca2l, and, behold, it be not in sight d2eper than the skin, and that there is no black hair in it; then the priest sha2l shut up him that hath the plague of the sca2l seven days: 
And in the seventh day the priest sha2l l2ok on the plague: and, behold, if the sca2l spread not, and there be in it no ye2low hair, and the sca2l be not in sight d2eper than the skin; 
He sha2l be shaven, but the sca2l sha2l he not shave; and the priest sha2l shut up him that hath the sca2l seven days more: 
And in the seventh day the priest sha2l l2ok on the sca2l: and, behold, if the sca2l be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight d2eper than the skin; then the priest sha2l pronounce him clean: and he sha2l wash his clothes, and be clean. 
But if the sca2l spread much in the skin after his cleansing; 
Then the priest sha2l l2ok on him: and, behold, if the sca2l be spread in the skin, the priest sha2l not s2ek for ye2low hair; he is unclean. 
But if the sca2l be in his sight at a stay, and that there is black hair grown up therein; the sca2l is healed, he is clean: and the priest sha2l pronounce him clean. 
If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, even white bright spots; 
Then the priest sha2l l2ok: and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish white; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean. 
And the man whose hair is fa2len o2f his head, he is bald; yet is he clean. 
And he that hath his hair fa2len o2f from the part of his head toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean. 
And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white re2dish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead. 
Then the priest sha2l l2ok upon it: and, behold, if the rising of the sore be white re2dish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy a2peareth in the skin of the flesh; 
He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest sha2l pronounce him u2terly unclean; his plague is in his head. 
And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes sha2l be rent, and his head bare, and he sha2l put a covering upon his u2per lip, and sha2l cry, Unclean, unclean. 
A2l the days wherein the plague sha2l be in him he sha2l be defiled; he is unclean: he sha2l dwe2l alone; without the camp sha2l his habitation be. 
The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a w2o2len garment, or a linen garment; 
Whether it be in the warp, or w2of; of linen, or of w2o2len; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin; 
And if the plague be gr2enish or re2dish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the w2of, or in any thing of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and sha2l be shewed unto the priest: 
And the priest sha2l l2ok upon the plague, and shut up it that hath the plague seven days: 
And he sha2l l2ok on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the w2of, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the plague is a fre2ting leprosy; it is unclean. 
He sha2l therefore burn that garment, whether warp or w2of, in w2o2len or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fre2ting leprosy; it sha2l be burnt in the fire. 
And if the priest sha2l l2ok, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the w2of, or in any thing of skin; 
Then the priest sha2l co2mand that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he sha2l shut it up seven days more: 
And the priest sha2l l2ok on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without. 
And if the priest l2ok, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he sha2l rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the w2of: 
And if it a2pear sti2l in the garment, either in the warp, or in the w2of, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire. 
And the garment, either warp, or w2of, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it sha2l be washed the second time, and sha2l be clean. 
This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of w2o2len or linen, either in the warp, or w2of, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
This sha2l be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He sha2l be brought unto the priest: 
And the priest sha2l go forth out of the camp; and the priest sha2l l2ok, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper; 
Then sha2l the priest co2mand to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar w2od, and scarlet, and hy2sop: 
And the priest sha2l co2mand that one of the birds be ki2led in an earthen ve2sel over ru2ning water: 
As for the living bird, he sha2l take it, and the cedar w2od, and the scarlet, and the hy2sop, and sha2l dip them and the living bird in the bl2od of the bird that was ki2led over the ru2ning water: 
And he sha2l sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and sha2l pronounce him clean, and sha2l let the living bird l2ose into the open field. 
And he that is to be cleansed sha2l wash his clothes, and shave o2f a2l his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he sha2l come into the camp, and sha2l ta2ry abroad out of his tent seven days. 
But it sha2l be on the seventh day, that he sha2l shave a2l his hair o2f his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even a2l his hair he sha2l shave o2f: and he sha2l wash his clothes, also he sha2l wash his flesh in water, and he sha2l be clean. 
And on the eighth day he sha2l take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and thr2e tenth deals of fine flour for a meat o2fering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil. 
And the priest that maketh him clean sha2l present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation: 
And the priest sha2l take one he lamb, and o2fer him for a trespa2s o2fering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave o2fering before the LORD: 
And he sha2l slay the lamb in the place where he sha2l ki2l the sin o2fering and the burnt o2fering, in the holy place: for as the sin o2fering is the priest's, so is the trespa2s o2fering: it is most holy: 
And the priest sha2l take some of the bl2od of the trespa2s o2fering, and the priest sha2l put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right f2ot: 
And the priest sha2l take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand: 
And the priest sha2l dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and sha2l sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD: 
And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand sha2l the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right f2ot, upon the bl2od of the trespa2s o2fering: 
And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he sha2l pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest sha2l make an atonement for him before the LORD. 
And the priest sha2l o2fer the sin o2fering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his unclea2ne2s; and afterward he sha2l ki2l the burnt o2fering: 
And the priest sha2l o2fer the burnt o2fering and the meat o2fering upon the altar: and the priest sha2l make an atonement for him, and he sha2l be clean. 
And if he be p2or, and ca2not get so much; then he sha2l take one lamb for a trespa2s o2fering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat o2fering, and a log of oil; 
And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one sha2l be a sin o2fering, and the other a burnt o2fering. 
And he sha2l bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation, before the LORD. 
And the priest sha2l take the lamb of the trespa2s o2fering, and the log of oil, and the priest sha2l wave them for a wave o2fering before the LORD: 
And he sha2l ki2l the lamb of the trespa2s o2fering, and the priest sha2l take some of the bl2od of the trespa2s o2fering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right f2ot: 
And the priest sha2l pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand: 
And the priest sha2l sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD: 
And the priest sha2l put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right f2ot, upon the place of the bl2od of the trespa2s o2fering: 
And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he sha2l put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the LORD. 
And he sha2l o2fer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, such as he can get; 
Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin o2fering, and the other for a burnt o2fering, with the meat o2fering: and the priest sha2l make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD. 
This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
When ye be come into the land of Can2an, which I give to you for a po2se2sion, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your po2se2sion; 
And he that owneth the house sha2l come and te2l the priest, saying, It s2emeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house: 
Then the priest sha2l co2mand that they empty the house, before the priest go into it to s2e the plague, that a2l that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest sha2l go in to s2e the house: 
And he sha2l l2ok on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the wa2ls of the house with ho2low strakes, gr2enish or re2dish, which in sight are lower than the wa2l; 
Then the priest sha2l go out of the house to the d2or of the house, and shut up the house seven days: 
And the priest sha2l come again the seventh day, and sha2l l2ok: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the wa2ls of the house; 
Then the priest sha2l co2mand that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they sha2l cast them into an unclean place without the city: 
And he sha2l cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they sha2l pour out the dust that they scrape o2f without the city into an unclean place: 
And they sha2l take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he sha2l take other morter, and sha2l plaister the house. 
And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered; 
Then the priest sha2l come and l2ok, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fre2ting leprosy in the house; it is unclean. 
And he sha2l break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and a2l the morter of the house; and he sha2l ca2ry them forth out of the city into an unclean place. 
Moreover he that goeth into the house a2l the while that it is shut up sha2l be unclean until the even. 
And he that lieth in the house sha2l wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house sha2l wash his clothes. 
And if the priest sha2l come in, and l2ok upon it, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the priest sha2l pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed. 
And he sha2l take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar w2od, and scarlet, and hy2sop: 
And he sha2l ki2l the one of the birds in an earthen ve2sel over ru2ning water: 
And he sha2l take the cedar w2od, and the hy2sop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the bl2od of the slain bird, and in the ru2ning water, and sprinkle the house seven times: 
And he sha2l cleanse the house with the bl2od of the bird, and with the ru2ning water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar w2od, and with the hy2sop, and with the scarlet: 
But he sha2l let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it sha2l be clean. 
This is the law for a2l ma2ner of plague of leprosy, and sca2l, 
And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house, 
And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot: 
To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath a ru2ning i2sue out of his flesh, because of his i2sue he is unclean. 
And this sha2l be his unclea2ne2s in his i2sue: whether his flesh run with his i2sue, or his flesh be sto2ped from his i2sue, it is his unclea2ne2s. 
Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the i2sue, is unclean: and every thing, whereon he si2teth, sha2l be unclean. 
And whosoever toucheth his bed sha2l wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 
And he that si2teth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the i2sue sha2l wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 
And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the i2sue sha2l wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 
And if he that hath the i2sue spit upon him that is clean; then he sha2l wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 
And what sa2dle soever he rideth upon that hath the i2sue sha2l be unclean. 
And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him sha2l be unclean until the even: and he that beareth any of those things sha2l wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 
And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the i2sue, and hath not rinsed his hands in water, he sha2l wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 
And the ve2sel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the i2sue, sha2l be broken: and every ve2sel of w2od sha2l be rinsed in water. 
And when he that hath an i2sue is cleansed of his i2sue; then he sha2l number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in ru2ning water, and sha2l be clean. 
And on the eighth day he sha2l take to him two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, and come before the LORD unto the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation, and give them unto the priest: 
And the priest sha2l o2fer them, the one for a sin o2fering, and the other for a burnt o2fering; and the priest sha2l make an atonement for him before the LORD for his i2sue. 
And if any man's s2ed of copulation go out from him, then he sha2l wash a2l his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even. 
And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the s2ed of copulation, sha2l be washed with water, and be unclean until the even. 
The woman also with whom man sha2l lie with s2ed of copulation, they sha2l both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even. 
And if a woman have an i2sue, and her i2sue in her flesh be bl2od, she sha2l be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her sha2l be unclean until the even. 
And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation sha2l be unclean: every thing also that she si2teth upon sha2l be unclean. 
And whosoever toucheth her bed sha2l wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 
And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon sha2l wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 
And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she si2teth, when he toucheth it, he sha2l be unclean until the even. 
And if any man lie with her at a2l, and her flowers be upon him, he sha2l be unclean seven days; and a2l the bed whereon he lieth sha2l be unclean. 
And if a woman have an i2sue of her bl2od many days out of the time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her separation; a2l the days of the i2sue of her unclea2ne2s sha2l be as the days of her separation: she sha2l be unclean. 
Every bed whereon she lieth a2l the days of her i2sue sha2l be unto her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she si2teth upon sha2l be unclean, as the unclea2ne2s of her separation. 
And whosoever toucheth those things sha2l be unclean, and sha2l wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 
But if she be cleansed of her i2sue, then she sha2l number to herself seven days, and after that she sha2l be clean. 
And on the eighth day she sha2l take unto her two turtles, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
And the priest sha2l o2fer the one for a sin o2fering, and the other for a burnt o2fering; and the priest sha2l make an atonement for her before the LORD for the i2sue of her unclea2ne2s. 
Thus sha2l ye separate the children of Israel from their unclea2ne2s; that they die not in their unclea2ne2s, when they defile my tabernacle that is among them. 
This is the law of him that hath an i2sue, and of him whose s2ed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith; 
And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an i2sue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they o2fered before the LORD, and died; 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at a2l times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I wi2l a2pear in the cloud upon the mercy seat. 
Thus sha2l Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bu2lock for a sin o2fering, and a ram for a burnt o2fering. 
He sha2l put on the holy linen coat, and he sha2l have the linen br2eches upon his flesh, and sha2l be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre sha2l he be a2tired: these are holy garments; therefore sha2l he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on. 
And he sha2l take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin o2fering, and one ram for a burnt o2fering. 
And Aaron sha2l o2fer his bu2lock of the sin o2fering, which is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house. 
And he sha2l take the two goats, and present them before the LORD at the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
And Aaron sha2l cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat. 
And Aaron sha2l bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fe2l, and o2fer him for a sin o2fering. 
But the goat, on which the lot fe2l to be the scapegoat, sha2l be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderne2s. 
And Aaron sha2l bring the bu2lock of the sin o2fering, which is for himself, and sha2l make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and sha2l ki2l the bu2lock of the sin o2fering which is for himself: 
And he sha2l take a censer fu2l of burning coals of fire from o2f the altar before the LORD, and his hands fu2l of sw2et incense beaten sma2l, and bring it within the vail: 
And he sha2l put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not: 
And he sha2l take of the bl2od of the bu2lock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat sha2l he sprinkle of the bl2od with his finger seven times. 
Then sha2l he ki2l the goat of the sin o2fering, that is for the people, and bring his bl2od within the vail, and do with that bl2od as he did with the bl2od of the bu2lock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat: 
And he sha2l make an atonement for the holy place, because of the unclea2ne2s of the children of Israel, and because of their transgre2sions in a2l their sins: and so sha2l he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their unclea2ne2s. 
And there sha2l be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for a2l the congregation of Israel. 
And he sha2l go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and sha2l take of the bl2od of the bu2lock, and of the bl2od of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about. 
And he sha2l sprinkle of the bl2od upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and ha2low it from the unclea2ne2s of the children of Israel. 
And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he sha2l bring the live goat: 
And Aaron sha2l lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confe2s over him a2l the iniquities of the children of Israel, and a2l their transgre2sions in a2l their sins, pu2ting them upon the head of the goat, and sha2l send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderne2s: 
And the goat sha2l bear upon him a2l their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he sha2l let go the goat in the wilderne2s. 
And Aaron sha2l come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and sha2l put o2f the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and sha2l leave them there: 
And he sha2l wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and o2fer his burnt o2fering, and the burnt o2fering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people. 
And the fat of the sin o2fering sha2l he burn upon the altar. 
And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat sha2l wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp. 
And the bu2lock for the sin o2fering, and the goat for the sin o2fering, whose bl2od was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, sha2l one ca2ry forth without the camp; and they sha2l burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung. 
And he that burneth them sha2l wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he sha2l come into the camp. 
And this sha2l be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye sha2l a2flict your souls, and do no work at a2l, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you: 
For on that day sha2l the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from a2l your sins before the LORD. 
It sha2l be a sa2bath of rest unto you, and ye sha2l a2flict your souls, by a statute for ever. 
And the priest, whom he sha2l anoint, and whom he sha2l consecrate to minister in the priest's o2fice in his father's stead, sha2l make the atonement, and sha2l put on the linen clothes, even the holy garments: 
And he sha2l make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he sha2l make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and he sha2l make an atonement for the priests, and for a2l the people of the congregation. 
And this sha2l be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for a2l their sins once a year. And he did as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto a2l the children of Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the LORD hath co2manded, saying, 
What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that ki2leth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that ki2leth it out of the camp, 
And bringeth it not unto the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation, to o2fer an o2fering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; bl2od sha2l be imputed unto that man; he hath shed bl2od; and that man sha2l be cut o2f from among his people: 
To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they o2fer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD, unto the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and o2fer them for peace o2ferings unto the LORD. 
And the priest sha2l sprinkle the bl2od upon the altar of the LORD at the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sw2et savour unto the LORD. 
And they sha2l no more o2fer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This sha2l be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations. 
And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that o2fereth a burnt o2fering or sacrifice, 
And bringeth it not unto the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation, to o2fer it unto the LORD; even that man sha2l be cut o2f from among his people. 
And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any ma2ner of bl2od; I wi2l even set my face against that soul that eateth bl2od, and wi2l cut him o2f from among his people. 
For the life of the flesh is in the bl2od: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the bl2od that maketh an atonement for the soul. 
Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you sha2l eat bl2od, neither sha2l any stranger that sojourneth among you eat bl2od. 
And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he sha2l even pour out the bl2od thereof, and cover it with dust. 
For it is the life of a2l flesh; the bl2od of it is for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye sha2l eat the bl2od of no ma2ner of flesh: for the life of a2l flesh is the bl2od thereof: whosoever eateth it sha2l be cut o2f. 
And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he sha2l both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then sha2l he be clean. 
But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he sha2l bear his iniquity. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God. 
After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, sha2l ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Can2an, whither I bring you, sha2l ye not do: neither sha2l ye walk in their ordinances. 
Ye sha2l do my judgments, and k2ep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am the LORD your God. 
Ye sha2l therefore k2ep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he sha2l live in them: I am the LORD. 
None of you sha2l a2proach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedne2s: I am the LORD. 
The nakedne2s of thy father, or the nakedne2s of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedne2s. 
The nakedne2s of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father's nakedne2s. 
The nakedne2s of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedne2s thou shalt not uncover. 
The nakedne2s of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, even their nakedne2s thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedne2s. 
The nakedne2s of thy father's wife's daughter, bego2ten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedne2s. 
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedne2s of thy father's sister: she is thy father's near kinswoman. 
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedne2s of thy mother's sister: for she is thy mother's near kinswoman. 
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedne2s of thy father's brother, thou shalt not a2proach to his wife: she is thine aunt. 
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedne2s of thy daughter in law: she is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedne2s. 
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedne2s of thy brother's wife: it is thy brother's nakedne2s. 
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedne2s of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedne2s; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedne2s. 
Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedne2s, beside the other in her life time. 
Also thou shalt not a2proach unto a woman to uncover her nakedne2s, as long as she is put apart for her unclea2ne2s. 
Moreover thou shalt not lie carna2ly with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her. 
And thou shalt not let any of thy s2ed pa2s through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD. 
Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination. 
Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither sha2l any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion. 
Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in a2l these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you: 
And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants. 
Ye sha2l therefore k2ep my statutes and my judgments, and sha2l not co2mit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you: 
(For a2l these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;) 
That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you. 
For whosoever sha2l co2mit any of these abominations, even the souls that co2mit them sha2l be cut o2f from among their people. 
Therefore sha2l ye k2ep mine ordinance, that ye co2mit not any one of these abominable customs, which were co2mi2ted before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto a2l the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye sha2l be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy. 
Ye sha2l fear every man his mother, and his father, and k2ep my sa2baths: I am the LORD your God. 
Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God. 
And if ye o2fer a sacrifice of peace o2ferings unto the LORD, ye sha2l o2fer it at your own wi2l. 
It sha2l be eaten the same day ye o2fer it, and on the mo2row: and if ought remain until the third day, it sha2l be burnt in the fire. 
And if it be eaten at a2l on the third day, it is abominable; it sha2l not be a2cepted. 
Therefore every one that eateth it sha2l bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the ha2lowed thing of the LORD: and that soul sha2l be cut o2f from among his people. 
And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not who2ly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest. 
And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the p2or and stranger: I am the LORD your God. 
Ye sha2l not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another. 
And ye sha2l not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD. 
Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the wages of him that is hired sha2l not abide with th2e a2l night until the morning. 
Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD. 
Ye sha2l do no unrighteousne2s in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the p2or, nor honor the person of the mighty: but in righteousne2s shalt thou judge thy neighbour. 
Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the bl2od of thy neighbour; I am the LORD. 
Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not su2fer sin upon him. 
Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD. 
Ye sha2l k2ep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy ca2tle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled s2ed: neither sha2l a garment mingled of linen and w2o2len come upon th2e. 
And whosoever lieth carna2ly with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at a2l red2emed, nor fr2edom given her; she sha2l be scourged; they sha2l not be put to death, because she was not fr2e. 
And he sha2l bring his trespa2s o2fering unto the LORD, unto the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespa2s o2fering. 
And the priest sha2l make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespa2s o2fering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done sha2l be forgiven him. 
And when ye sha2l come into the land, and sha2l have planted a2l ma2ner of tr2es for f2od, then ye sha2l count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: thr2e years sha2l it be as uncircumcised unto you: it sha2l not be eaten of. 
But in the fourth year a2l the fruit thereof sha2l be holy to praise the LORD withal. 
And in the fifth year sha2l ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God. 
Ye sha2l not eat any thing with the bl2od: neither sha2l ye use enchantment, nor observe times. 
Ye sha2l not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard. 
Ye sha2l not make any cu2tings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD. 
Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fa2l to whoredom, and the land become fu2l of wickedne2s. 
Ye sha2l k2ep my sa2baths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD. 
Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither s2ek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God. 
Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD. 
And if a stranger sojourn with th2e in your land, ye sha2l not vex him. 
But the stranger that dwe2leth with you sha2l be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God. 
Ye sha2l do no unrighteousne2s in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure. 
Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, sha2l ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt. 
Therefore sha2l ye observe a2l my statutes, and a2l my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his s2ed unto Molech; he sha2l surely be put to death: the people of the land sha2l stone him with stones. 
And I wi2l set my face against that man, and wi2l cut him o2f from among his people; because he hath given of his s2ed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name. 
And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his s2ed unto Molech, and ki2l him not: 
Then I wi2l set my face against that man, and against his family, and wi2l cut him o2f, and a2l that go a whoring after him, to co2mit whoredom with Molech, from among their people. 
And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I wi2l even set my face against that soul, and wi2l cut him o2f from among his people. 
Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God. 
And ye sha2l k2ep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which sanctify you. 
For every one that curseth his father or his mother sha2l be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his bl2od sha2l be upon him. 
And the man that co2mi2teth adultery with another man's wife, even he that co2mi2teth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adultere2s sha2l surely be put to death. 
And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedne2s: both of them sha2l surely be put to death; their bl2od sha2l be upon them. 
And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them sha2l surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their bl2od sha2l be upon them. 
If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have co2mi2ted an abomination: they sha2l surely be put to death; their bl2od sha2l be upon them. 
And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedne2s: they sha2l be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedne2s among you. 
And if a man lie with a beast, he sha2l surely be put to death: and ye sha2l slay the beast. 
And if a woman a2proach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt ki2l the woman, and the beast: they sha2l surely be put to death; their bl2od sha2l be upon them. 
And if a man sha2l take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and s2e her nakedne2s, and she s2e his nakedne2s; it is a wicked thing; and they sha2l be cut o2f in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedne2s; he sha2l bear his iniquity. 
And if a man sha2l lie with a woman having her sickne2s, and sha2l uncover her nakedne2s; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her bl2od: and both of them sha2l be cut o2f from among their people. 
And thou shalt not uncover the nakedne2s of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they sha2l bear their iniquity. 
And if a man sha2l lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedne2s: they sha2l bear their sin; they sha2l die childle2s. 
And if a man sha2l take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedne2s; they sha2l be childle2s. 
Ye sha2l therefore k2ep a2l my statutes, and a2l my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwe2l therein, spue you not out. 
And ye sha2l not walk in the ma2ners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they co2mi2ted a2l these things, and therefore I abho2red them. 
But I have said unto you, Ye sha2l inherit their land, and I wi2l give it unto you to po2se2s it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from other people. 
Ye sha2l therefore put di2ference betw2en clean beasts and unclean, and betw2en unclean fowls and clean: and ye sha2l not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any ma2ner of living thing that cr2epeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean. 
And ye sha2l be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine. 
A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, sha2l surely be put to death: they sha2l stone them with stones: their bl2od sha2l be upon them. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There sha2l none be defiled for the dead among his people: 
But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother. 
And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled. 
But he sha2l not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself. 
They sha2l not make baldne2s upon their head, neither sha2l they shave o2f the corner of their beard, nor make any cu2tings in their flesh. 
They sha2l be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the o2ferings of the LORD made by fire, and the bread of their God, they do o2fer: therefore they sha2l be holy. 
They sha2l not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither sha2l they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God. 
Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he o2fereth the bread of thy God: he sha2l be holy unto th2e: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, am holy. 
And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she sha2l be burnt with fire. 
And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, sha2l not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes; 
Neither sha2l he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother; 
Neither sha2l he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD. 
And he sha2l take a wife in her virginity. 
A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these sha2l he not take: but he sha2l take a virgin of his own people to wife. 
Neither sha2l he profane his s2ed among his people: for I the LORD do sanctify him. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy s2ed in their generations that hath any blemish, let him not a2proach to o2fer the bread of his God. 
For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he sha2l not a2proach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous, 
Or a man that is brokenf2oted, or brokenhanded, 
Or cr2okbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or sca2bed, or hath his stones broken; 
No man that hath a blemish of the s2ed of Aaron the priest sha2l come nigh to o2fer the o2ferings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish; he sha2l not come nigh to o2fer the bread of his God. 
He sha2l eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy. 
Only he sha2l not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them. 
And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto a2l the children of Israel. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they ha2low unto me: I am the LORD. 
Say unto them, Whosoever he be of a2l your s2ed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel ha2low unto the LORD, having his unclea2ne2s upon him, that soul sha2l be cut o2f from my presence: I am the LORD. 
What man soever of the s2ed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a ru2ning i2sue; he sha2l not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose s2ed goeth from him; 
Or whosoever toucheth any cr2eping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take unclea2ne2s, whatsoever unclea2ne2s he hath; 
The soul which hath touched any such sha2l be unclean until even, and sha2l not eat of the holy things, unle2s he wash his flesh with water. 
And when the sun is down, he sha2l be clean, and sha2l afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his f2od. 
That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he sha2l not eat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD. 
They sha2l therefore k2ep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them. 
There sha2l no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, sha2l not eat of the holy thing. 
But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he sha2l eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they sha2l eat of his meat. 
If the priest's daughter also be ma2ried unto a stranger, she may not eat of an o2fering of the holy things. 
But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she sha2l eat of her father's meat: but there sha2l be no stranger eat thereof. 
And if a man eat of the holy thing unwi2tingly, then he sha2l put the fifth part thereof unto it, and sha2l give it unto the priest with the holy thing. 
And they sha2l not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they o2fer unto the LORD; 
Or su2fer them to bear the iniquity of trespa2s, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto a2l the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that wi2l o2fer his oblation for a2l his vows, and for a2l his fr2ewi2l o2ferings, which they wi2l o2fer unto the LORD for a burnt o2fering; 
Ye sha2l o2fer at your own wi2l a male without blemish, of the b2eves, of the sh2ep, or of the goats. 
But whatsoever hath a blemish, that sha2l ye not o2fer: for it sha2l not be a2ceptable for you. 
And whosoever o2fereth a sacrifice of peace o2ferings unto the LORD to a2complish his vow, or a fr2ewi2l o2fering in b2eves or sh2ep, it sha2l be perfect to be a2cepted; there sha2l be no blemish therein. 
Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or sca2bed, ye sha2l not o2fer these unto the LORD, nor make an o2fering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD. 
Either a bu2lock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou o2fer for a fr2ewi2l o2fering; but for a vow it sha2l not be a2cepted. 
Ye sha2l not o2fer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither sha2l ye make any o2fering thereof in your land. 
Neither from a stranger's hand sha2l ye o2fer the bread of your God of any of these; because their co2ruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they sha2l not be a2cepted for you. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
When a bu2lock, or a sh2ep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it sha2l be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it sha2l be a2cepted for an o2fering made by fire unto the LORD. 
And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye sha2l not ki2l it and her young both in one day. 
And when ye wi2l o2fer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, o2fer it at your own wi2l. 
On the same day it sha2l be eaten up; ye sha2l leave none of it until the mo2row: I am the LORD. 
Therefore sha2l ye k2ep my co2mandments, and do them: I am the LORD. 
Neither sha2l ye profane my holy name; but I wi2l be ha2lowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which ha2low you, 
That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye sha2l proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts. 
Six days sha2l work be done: but the seventh day is the sa2bath of rest, an holy convocation; ye sha2l do no work therein: it is the sa2bath of the LORD in a2l your dwe2lings. 
These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye sha2l proclaim in their seasons. 
In the fourt2enth day of the first month at even is the LORD's pa2sover. 
And on the fift2enth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread. 
In the first day ye sha2l have an holy convocation: ye sha2l do no servile work therein. 
But ye sha2l o2fer an o2fering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye sha2l do no servile work therein. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and sha2l reap the harvest thereof, then ye sha2l bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: 
And he sha2l wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be a2cepted for you: on the mo2row after the sa2bath the priest sha2l wave it. 
And ye sha2l o2fer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt o2fering unto the LORD. 
And the meat o2fering thereof sha2l be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an o2fering made by fire unto the LORD for a sw2et savour: and the drink o2fering thereof sha2l be of wine, the fourth part of an hin. 
And ye sha2l eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor gr2en ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an o2fering unto your God: it sha2l be a statute for ever throughout your generations in a2l your dwe2lings. 
And ye sha2l count unto you from the mo2row after the sa2bath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave o2fering; seven sa2baths sha2l be complete: 
Even unto the mo2row after the seventh sa2bath sha2l ye number fifty days; and ye sha2l o2fer a new meat o2fering unto the LORD. 
Ye sha2l bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals; they sha2l be of fine flour; they sha2l be baken with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD. 
And ye sha2l o2fer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bu2lock, and two rams: they sha2l be for a burnt o2fering unto the LORD, with their meat o2fering, and their drink o2ferings, even an o2fering made by fire, of sw2et savour unto the LORD. 
Then ye sha2l sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin o2fering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace o2ferings. 
And the priest sha2l wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave o2fering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they sha2l be holy to the LORD for the priest. 
And ye sha2l proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy convocation unto you: ye sha2l do no servile work therein: it sha2l be a statute for ever in a2l your dwe2lings throughout your generations. 
And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean ri2dance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the p2or, and to the stranger: I am the LORD your God. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, sha2l ye have a sa2bath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation. 
Ye sha2l do no servile work therein: but ye sha2l o2fer an o2fering made by fire unto the LORD. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there sha2l be a day of atonement: it sha2l be an holy convocation unto you; and ye sha2l a2flict your souls, and o2fer an o2fering made by fire unto the LORD. 
And ye sha2l do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God. 
For whatsoever soul it be that sha2l not be a2flicted in that same day, he sha2l be cut o2f from among his people. 
And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul wi2l I destroy from among his people. 
Ye sha2l do no ma2ner of work: it sha2l be a statute for ever throughout your generations in a2l your dwe2lings. 
It sha2l be unto you a sa2bath of rest, and ye sha2l a2flict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, sha2l ye celebrate your sa2bath. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fift2enth day of this seventh month sha2l be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD. 
On the first day sha2l be an holy convocation: ye sha2l do no servile work therein. 
Seven days ye sha2l o2fer an o2fering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day sha2l be an holy convocation unto you; and ye sha2l o2fer an o2fering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a solemn a2sembly; and ye sha2l do no servile work therein. 
These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye sha2l proclaim to be holy convocations, to o2fer an o2fering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt o2fering, and a meat o2fering, a sacrifice, and drink o2ferings, every thing upon his day: 
Beside the sa2baths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside a2l your vows, and beside a2l your fr2ewi2l o2ferings, which ye give unto the LORD. 
Also in the fift2enth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye sha2l k2ep a feast unto the LORD seven days: on the first day sha2l be a sa2bath, and on the eighth day sha2l be a sa2bath. 
And ye sha2l take you on the first day the boughs of g2odly tr2es, branches of palm tr2es, and the boughs of thick tr2es, and wi2lows of the br2ok; and ye sha2l rejoice before the LORD your God seven days. 
And ye sha2l k2ep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year. It sha2l be a statute for ever in your generations: ye sha2l celebrate it in the seventh month. 
Ye sha2l dwe2l in b2oths seven days; a2l that are Israelites born sha2l dwe2l in b2oths: 
That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwe2l in b2oths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God. 
And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Co2mand the children of Israel, that they bring unto th2e pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continua2ly. 
Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, sha2l Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continua2ly: it sha2l be a statute for ever in your generations. 
He sha2l order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continua2ly. 
And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals sha2l be in one cake. 
And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the LORD. 
And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an o2fering made by fire unto the LORD. 
Every sa2bath he sha2l set it in order before the LORD continua2ly, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant. 
And it sha2l be Aaron's and his sons'; and they sha2l eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the o2ferings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute. 
And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp; 
And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:) 
And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let a2l that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let a2l the congregation stone him. 
And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God sha2l bear his sin. 
And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he sha2l surely be put to death, and a2l the congregation sha2l certainly stone him: as we2l the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, sha2l be put to death. 
And he that ki2leth any man sha2l surely be put to death. 
And he that ki2leth a beast sha2l make it g2od; beast for beast. 
And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so sha2l it be done to him; 
Breach for breach, eye for eye, t2oth for t2oth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so sha2l it be done to him again. 
And he that ki2leth a beast, he sha2l restore it: and he that ki2leth a man, he sha2l be put to death. 
Ye sha2l have one ma2ner of law, as we2l for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God. 
And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then sha2l the land k2ep a sa2bath unto the LORD. 
Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof; 
But in the seventh year sha2l be a sa2bath of rest unto the land, a sa2bath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard. 
That which groweth of its own a2cord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undre2sed: for it is a year of rest unto the land. 
And the sa2bath of the land sha2l be meat for you; for th2e, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with th2e. 
And for thy ca2tle, and for the beast that are in thy land, sha2l a2l the increase thereof be meat. 
And thou shalt number seven sa2baths of years unto th2e, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sa2baths of years sha2l be unto th2e forty and nine years. 
Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement sha2l ye make the trumpet sound throughout a2l your land. 
And ye sha2l ha2low the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout a2l the land unto a2l the inhabitants thereof: it sha2l be a jubile unto you; and ye sha2l return every man unto his po2se2sion, and ye sha2l return every man unto his family. 
A jubile sha2l that fiftieth year be unto you: ye sha2l not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undre2sed. 
For it is the jubile; it sha2l be holy unto you: ye sha2l eat the increase thereof out of the field. 
In the year of this jubile ye sha2l return every man unto his po2se2sion. 
And if thou se2l ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand, ye sha2l not o2pre2s one another: 
A2cording to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and a2cording unto the number of years of the fruits he sha2l se2l unto th2e: 
A2cording to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and a2cording to the fewne2s of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for a2cording to the number of the years of the fruits doth he se2l unto th2e. 
Ye sha2l not therefore o2pre2s one another; but thou shalt fear thy God:for I am the LORD your God. 
Wherefore ye sha2l do my statutes, and k2ep my judgments, and do them; and ye sha2l dwe2l in the land in safety. 
And the land sha2l yield her fruit, and ye sha2l eat your fi2l, and dwe2l therein in safety. 
And if ye sha2l say, What sha2l we eat the seventh year? behold, we sha2l not sow, nor gather in our increase: 
Then I wi2l co2mand my ble2sing upon you in the sixth year, and it sha2l bring forth fruit for thr2e years. 
And ye sha2l sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye sha2l eat of the old store. 
The land sha2l not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for ye are strangers and sojourners with me. 
And in a2l the land of your po2se2sion ye sha2l grant a redemption for the land. 
If thy brother be waxen p2or, and hath sold away some of his po2se2sion, and if any of his kin come to red2em it, then sha2l he red2em that which his brother sold. 
And if the man have none to red2em it, and himself be able to red2em it; 
Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his po2se2sion. 
But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold sha2l remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it sha2l go out, and he sha2l return unto his po2se2sion. 
And if a man se2l a dwe2ling house in a wa2led city, then he may red2em it within a whole year after it is sold; within a fu2l year may he red2em it. 
And if it be not red2emed within the space of a fu2l year, then the house that is in the wa2led city sha2l be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it sha2l not go out in the jubile. 
But the houses of the vi2lages which have no wa2l round about them sha2l be counted as the fields of the country: they may be red2emed, and they sha2l go out in the jubile. 
Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their po2se2sion, may the Levites red2em at any time. 
And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his po2se2sion, sha2l go out in the year of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their po2se2sion among the children of Israel. 
But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual po2se2sion. 
And if thy brother be waxen p2or, and fa2len in decay with th2e; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with th2e. 
Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with th2e. 
Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase. 
I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Can2an, and to be your God. 
And if thy brother that dwe2leth by th2e be waxen p2or, and be sold unto th2e; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant: 
But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he sha2l be with th2e, and sha2l serve th2e unto the year of jubile. 
And then sha2l he depart from th2e, both he and his children with him, and sha2l return unto his own family, and unto the po2se2sion of his fathers sha2l he return. 
For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they sha2l not be sold as bondmen. 
Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God. 
Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, sha2l be of the heathen that are round about you; of them sha2l ye buy bondmen and bondmaids. 
Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them sha2l ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they sha2l be your po2se2sion. 
And ye sha2l take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a po2se2sion; they sha2l be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye sha2l not rule one over another with rigour. 
And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by th2e, and thy brother that dwe2leth by him wax p2or, and se2l himself unto the stranger or sojourner by th2e, or to the stock of the stranger's family: 
After that he is sold he may be red2emed again; one of his brethren may red2em him: 
Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may red2em him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may red2em him; or if he be able, he may red2em himself. 
And he sha2l reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale sha2l be a2cording unto the number of years, a2cording to the time of an hired servant sha2l it be with him. 
If there be yet many years behind, a2cording unto them he sha2l give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for. 
And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he sha2l count with him, and a2cording unto his years sha2l he give him again the price of his redemption. 
And as a yearly hired servant sha2l he be with him: and the other sha2l not rule with rigour over him in thy sight. 
And if he be not red2emed in these years, then he sha2l go out in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him. 
For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God. 
Ye sha2l make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither sha2l ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God. 
Ye sha2l k2ep my sa2baths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD. 
If ye walk in my statutes, and k2ep my co2mandments, and do them; 
Then I wi2l give you rain in due season, and the land sha2l yield her increase, and the tr2es of the field sha2l yield their fruit. 
And your threshing sha2l reach unto the vintage, and the vintage sha2l reach unto the sowing time: and ye sha2l eat your bread to the fu2l, and dwe2l in your land safely. 
And I wi2l give peace in the land, and ye sha2l lie down, and none sha2l make you afraid: and I wi2l rid evil beasts out of the land, neither sha2l the sword go through your land. 
And ye sha2l chase your enemies, and they sha2l fa2l before you by the sword. 
And five of you sha2l chase an hundred, and an hundred of you sha2l put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies sha2l fa2l before you by the sword. 
For I wi2l have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you. 
And ye sha2l eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new. 
And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul sha2l not abhor you. 
And I wi2l walk among you, and wi2l be your God, and ye sha2l be my people. 
I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright. 
But if ye wi2l not hearken unto me, and wi2l not do a2l these co2mandments; 
And if ye sha2l despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye wi2l not do a2l my co2mandments, but that ye break my covenant: 
I also wi2l do this unto you; I wi2l even a2point over you te2ror, consumption, and the burning ague, that sha2l consume the eyes, and cause so2row of heart: and ye sha2l sow your s2ed in vain, for your enemies sha2l eat it. 
And I wi2l set my face against you, and ye sha2l be slain before your enemies: they that hate you sha2l reign over you; and ye sha2l fl2e when none pursueth you. 
And if ye wi2l not yet for a2l this hearken unto me, then I wi2l punish you seven times more for your sins. 
And I wi2l break the pride of your power; and I wi2l make your heaven as iron, and your earth as bra2s: 
And your strength sha2l be spent in vain: for your land sha2l not yield her increase, neither sha2l the tr2es of the land yield their fruits. 
And if ye walk contrary unto me, and wi2l not hearken unto me; I wi2l bring seven times more plagues upon you a2cording to your sins. 
I wi2l also send wild beasts among you, which sha2l rob you of your children, and destroy your ca2tle, and make you few in number; and your high ways sha2l be desolate. 
And if ye wi2l not be reformed by me by these things, but wi2l walk contrary unto me; 
Then wi2l I also walk contrary unto you, and wi2l punish you yet seven times for your sins. 
And I wi2l bring a sword upon you, that sha2l avenge the qua2rel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I wi2l send the pestilence among you; and ye sha2l be delivered into the hand of the enemy. 
And when I have broken the sta2f of your bread, ten women sha2l bake your bread in one oven, and they sha2l deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye sha2l eat, and not be satisfied. 
And if ye wi2l not for a2l this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me; 
Then I wi2l walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, wi2l chastise you seven times for your sins. 
And ye sha2l eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters sha2l ye eat. 
And I wi2l destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul sha2l abhor you. 
And I wi2l make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I wi2l not sme2l the savour of your sw2et odours. 
And I wi2l bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwe2l therein sha2l be astonished at it. 
And I wi2l sca2ter you among the heathen, and wi2l draw out a sword after you: and your land sha2l be desolate, and your cities waste. 
Then sha2l the land enjoy her sa2baths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then sha2l the land rest, and enjoy her sa2baths. 
As long as it lieth desolate it sha2l rest; because it did not rest in your sa2baths, when ye dwelt upon it. 
And upon them that are left alive of you I wi2l send a faintne2s into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf sha2l chase them; and they sha2l fl2e, as fl2eing from a sword; and they sha2l fa2l when none pursueth. 
And they sha2l fa2l one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye sha2l have no power to stand before your enemies. 
And ye sha2l perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies sha2l eat you up. 
And they that are left of you sha2l pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers sha2l they pine away with them. 
If they sha2l confe2s their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespa2s which they trespa2sed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me; 
And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then a2cept of the punishment of their iniquity: 
Then wi2l I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Is2ac, and also my covenant with Abraham wi2l I remember; and I wi2l remember the land. 
The land also sha2l be left of them, and sha2l enjoy her sa2baths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they sha2l a2cept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abho2red my statutes. 
And yet for a2l that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I wi2l not cast them away, neither wi2l I abhor them, to destroy them u2terly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God. 
But I wi2l for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD. 
These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made betw2en him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man sha2l make a singular vow, the persons sha2l be for the LORD by thy estimation. 
And thy estimation sha2l be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation sha2l be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 
And if it be a female, then thy estimation sha2l be thirty shekels. 
And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation sha2l be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 
And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation sha2l be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation sha2l be thr2e shekels of silver. 
And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation sha2l be fift2en shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 
But if he be p2orer than thy estimation, then he sha2l present himself before the priest, and the priest sha2l value him; a2cording to his ability that vowed sha2l the priest value him. 
And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an o2fering unto the LORD, a2l that any man giveth of such unto the LORD sha2l be holy. 
He sha2l not alter it, nor change it, a g2od for a bad, or a bad for a g2od: and if he sha2l at a2l change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof sha2l be holy. 
And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not o2fer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he sha2l present the beast before the priest: 
And the priest sha2l value it, whether it be g2od or bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so sha2l it be. 
But if he wi2l at a2l red2em it, then he sha2l a2d a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation. 
And when a man sha2l sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest sha2l estimate it, whether it be g2od or bad: as the priest sha2l estimate it, so sha2l it stand. 
And if he that sanctified it wi2l red2em his house, then he sha2l a2d the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it sha2l be his. 
And if a man sha2l sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of his po2se2sion, then thy estimation sha2l be a2cording to the s2ed thereof: an homer of barley s2ed sha2l be valued at fifty shekels of silver. 
If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, a2cording to thy estimation it sha2l stand. 
But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest sha2l reckon unto him the money a2cording to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it sha2l be abated from thy estimation. 
And if he that sanctified the field wi2l in any wise red2em it, then he sha2l a2d the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it sha2l be a2sured to him. 
And if he wi2l not red2em the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it sha2l not be red2emed any more. 
But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, sha2l be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the po2se2sion thereof sha2l be the priest's. 
And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his po2se2sion; 
Then the priest sha2l reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he sha2l give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD. 
In the year of the jubile the field sha2l return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the po2se2sion of the land did belong. 
And a2l thy estimations sha2l be a2cording to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs sha2l be the shekel. 
Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's firstling, no man sha2l sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sh2ep: it is the LORD's. 
And if it be of an unclean beast, then he sha2l red2em it a2cording to thine estimation, and sha2l a2d a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not red2emed, then it sha2l be sold a2cording to thy estimation. 
Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man sha2l devote unto the LORD of a2l that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his po2se2sion, sha2l be sold or red2emed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD. 
None devoted, which sha2l be devoted of men, sha2l be red2emed; but sha2l surely be put to death. 
And a2l the tithe of the land, whether of the s2ed of the land, or of the fruit of the tr2e, is the LORD's: it is holy unto the LORD. 
And if a man wi2l at a2l red2em ought of his tithes, he sha2l a2d thereto the fifth part thereof. 
And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever pa2seth under the rod, the tenth sha2l be holy unto the LORD. 
He sha2l not search whether it be g2od or bad, neither sha2l he change it: and if he change it at a2l, then both it and the change thereof sha2l be holy; it sha2l not be red2emed. 
These are the co2mandments, which the LORD co2manded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderne2s of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, 
Take ye the sum of a2l the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by their po2ls; 
From twenty years old and upward, a2l that are able to go forth to war in Israel: thou and Aaron sha2l number them by their armies. 
And with you there sha2l be a man of every tribe; every one head of the house of his fathers. 
And these are the names of the men that sha2l stand with you: of the tribe of Reuben; Elizur the son of Shedeur. 
Of Simeon; Shelumiel the son of Zurisha2dai. 
Of Judah; Nahshon the son of A2minadab. 
Of I2sachar; Nethan2el the son of Zuar. 
Of Zebulun; Eliab the son of Helon. 
Of the children of Joseph: of Ephraim; Elishama the son of A2mihud: of Mana2seh; Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. 
Of Benjamin; Abidan the son of Gideoni. 
Of Dan; Ahiezer the son of A2misha2dai. 
Of Asher; Pagiel the son of Ocran. 
Of Gad; Eliasaph the son of Deuel. 
Of Naphtali; Ahira the son of Enan. 
These were the renowned of the congregation, princes of the tribes of their fathers, heads of thousands in Israel. 
And Moses and Aaron t2ok these men which are expre2sed by their names: 
And they a2sembled a2l the congregation together on the first day of the second month, and they declared their pedigr2es after their families, by the house of their fathers, a2cording to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their po2ls. 
As the LORD co2manded Moses, so he numbered them in the wilderne2s of Sinai. 
And the children of Reuben, Israel's eldest son, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, a2cording to the number of the names, by their po2ls, every male from twenty years old and upward, a2l that were able to go forth to war; 
Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Reuben, were forty and six thousand and five hundred. 
Of the children of Simeon, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, those that were numbered of them, a2cording to the number of the names, by their po2ls, every male from twenty years old and upward, a2l that were able to go forth to war; 
Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Simeon, were fifty and nine thousand and thr2e hundred. 
Of the children of Gad, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, a2cording to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, a2l that were able to go forth to war; 
Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Gad, were forty and five thousand six hundred and fifty. 
Of the children of Judah, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, a2cording to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, a2l that were able to go forth to war; 
Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Judah, were thr2escore and fourt2en thousand and six hundred. 
Of the children of I2sachar, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, a2cording to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, a2l that were able to go forth to war; 
Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of I2sachar, were fifty and four thousand and four hundred. 
Of the children of Zebulun, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, a2cording to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, a2l that were able to go forth to war; 
Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Zebulun, were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred. 
Of the children of Joseph, namely, of the children of Ephraim, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, a2cording to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, a2l that were able to go forth to war; 
Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Ephraim, were forty thousand and five hundred. 
Of the children of Mana2seh, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, a2cording to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, a2l that were able to go forth to war; 
Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Mana2seh, were thirty and two thousand and two hundred. 
Of the children of Benjamin, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, a2cording to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, a2l that were able to go forth to war; 
Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Benjamin, were thirty and five thousand and four hundred. 
Of the children of Dan, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, a2cording to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, a2l that were able to go forth to war; 
Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Dan, were thr2escore and two thousand and seven hundred. 
Of the children of Asher, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, a2cording to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, a2l that were able to go forth to war; 
Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Asher, were forty and one thousand and five hundred. 
Of the children of Naphtali, throughout their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, a2cording to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, a2l that were able to go forth to war; 
Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Naphtali, were fifty and thr2e thousand and four hundred. 
These are those that were numbered, which Moses and Aaron numbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men: each one was for the house of his fathers. 
So were a2l those that were numbered of the children of Israel, by the house of their fathers, from twenty years old and upward, a2l that were able to go forth to war in Israel; 
Even a2l they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and thr2e thousand and five hundred and fifty. 
But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them. 
For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying, 
Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel: 
But thou shalt a2point the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over a2l the ve2sels thereof, and over a2l things that belong to it: they sha2l bear the tabernacle, and a2l the ve2sels thereof; and they sha2l minister unto it, and sha2l encamp round about the tabernacle. 
And when the tabernacle se2teth forward, the Levites sha2l take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites sha2l set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh sha2l be put to death. 
And the children of Israel sha2l pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts. 
But the Levites sha2l pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites sha2l k2ep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony. 
And the children of Israel did a2cording to a2l that the LORD co2manded Moses, so did they. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
Every man of the children of Israel sha2l pitch by his own standard, with the ensign of their father's house: far o2f about the tabernacle of the congregation sha2l they pitch. 
And on the east side toward the rising of the sun sha2l they of the standard of the camp of Judah pitch throughout their armies: and Nahshon the son of A2minadab sha2l be captain of the children of Judah. 
And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were thr2escore and fourt2en thousand and six hundred. 
And those that do pitch next unto him sha2l be the tribe of I2sachar: and Nethan2el the son of Zuar sha2l be captain of the children of I2sachar. 
And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and four thousand and four hundred. 
Then the tribe of Zebulun: and Eliab the son of Helon sha2l be captain of the children of Zebulun. 
And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred. 
A2l that were numbered in the camp of Judah were an hundred thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four hundred, throughout their armies. These sha2l first set forth. 
On the south side sha2l be the standard of the camp of Reuben a2cording to their armies: and the captain of the children of Reuben sha2l be Elizur the son of Shedeur. 
And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were forty and six thousand and five hundred. 
And those which pitch by him sha2l be the tribe of Simeon: and the captain of the children of Simeon sha2l be Shelumiel the son of Zurisha2dai. 
And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty and nine thousand and thr2e hundred. 
Then the tribe of Gad: and the captain of the sons of Gad sha2l be Eliasaph the son of Reuel. 
And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty and five thousand and six hundred and fifty. 
A2l that were numbered in the camp of Reuben were an hundred thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and fifty, throughout their armies. And they sha2l set forth in the second rank. 
Then the tabernacle of the congregation sha2l set forward with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camp: as they encamp, so sha2l they set forward, every man in his place by their standards. 
On the west side sha2l be the standard of the camp of Ephraim a2cording to their armies: and the captain of the sons of Ephraim sha2l be Elishama the son of A2mihud. 
And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty thousand and five hundred. 
And by him sha2l be the tribe of Mana2seh: and the captain of the children of Mana2seh sha2l be Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. 
And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were thirty and two thousand and two hundred. 
Then the tribe of Benjamin: and the captain of the sons of Benjamin sha2l be Abidan the son of Gideoni. 
And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were thirty and five thousand and four hundred. 
A2l that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim were an hundred thousand and eight thousand and an hundred, throughout their armies. And they sha2l go forward in the third rank. 
The standard of the camp of Dan sha2l be on the north side by their armies: and the captain of the children of Dan sha2l be Ahiezer the son of A2misha2dai. 
And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were thr2escore and two thousand and seven hundred. 
And those that encamp by him sha2l be the tribe of Asher: and the captain of the children of Asher sha2l be Pagiel the son of Ocran. 
And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty and one thousand and five hundred. 
Then the tribe of Naphtali: and the captain of the children of Naphtali sha2l be Ahira the son of Enan. 
And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty and thr2e thousand and four hundred. 
A2l they that were numbered in the camp of Dan were an hundred thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred. They sha2l go hindmost with their standards. 
These are those which were numbered of the children of Israel by the house of their fathers: a2l those that were numbered of the camps throughout their hosts were six hundred thousand and thr2e thousand and five hundred and fifty. 
But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And the children of Israel did a2cording to a2l that the LORD co2manded Moses: so they pitched by their standards, and so they set forward, every one after their families, a2cording to the house of their fathers. 
These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that the LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai. 
And these are the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's o2fice. 
And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they o2fered strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderne2s of Sinai, and they had no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's o2fice in the sight of Aaron their father. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him. 
And they sha2l k2ep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the service of the tabernacle. 
And they sha2l k2ep a2l the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle. 
And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they are who2ly given unto him out of the children of Israel. 
And thou shalt a2point Aaron and his sons, and they sha2l wait on their priest's o2fice: and the stranger that cometh nigh sha2l be put to death. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of a2l the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites sha2l be mine; 
Because a2l the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I smote a2l the firstborn in the land of Egypt I ha2lowed unto me a2l the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast: mine sha2l they be: I am the LORD. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderne2s of Sinai, saying, 
Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them. 
And Moses numbered them a2cording to the word of the LORD, as he was co2manded. 
And these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. 
And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families; Libni, and Shimei. 
And the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar, Hebron, and U2ziel. 
And the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites a2cording to the house of their fathers. 
Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family of the Shimites: these are the families of the Gershonites. 
Those that were numbered of them, a2cording to the number of a2l the males, from a month old and upward, even those that were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred. 
The families of the Gershonites sha2l pitch behind the tabernacle westward. 
And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites sha2l be Eliasaph the son of Lael. 
And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation sha2l be the tabernacle, and the tent, the covering thereof, and the hanging for the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation, 
And the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the d2or of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about, and the cords of it for a2l the service thereof. 
And of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family of the Izeharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the U2zielites: these are the families of the Kohathites. 
In the number of a2l the males, from a month old and upward, were eight thousand and six hundred, k2eping the charge of the sanctuary. 
The families of the sons of Kohath sha2l pitch on the side of the tabernacle southward. 
And the chief of the house of the father of the families of the Kohathites sha2l be Elizaphan the son of U2ziel. 
And their charge sha2l be the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the ve2sels of the sanctuary wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and a2l the service thereof. 
And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest sha2l be chief over the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them that k2ep the charge of the sanctuary. 
Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites, and the family of the Mushites: these are the families of Merari. 
And those that were numbered of them, a2cording to the number of a2l the males, from a month old and upward, were six thousand and two hundred. 
And the chief of the house of the father of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail: these sha2l pitch on the side of the tabernacle northward. 
And under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari sha2l be the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pi2lars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and a2l the ve2sels thereof, and a2l that serveth thereto, 
And the pi2lars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords. 
But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east, even before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, sha2l be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, k2eping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the stranger that cometh nigh sha2l be put to death. 
A2l that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron numbered at the co2mandment of the LORD, throughout their families, a2l the males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two thousand. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Number a2l the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names. 
And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the LORD) instead of a2l the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the ca2tle of the Levites instead of a2l the firstlings among the ca2tle of the children of Israel. 
And Moses numbered, as the LORD co2manded him, a2l the firstborn among the children of Israel. 
And a2l the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and thr2escore and thirt2en. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Take the Levites instead of a2l the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the ca2tle of the Levites instead of their ca2tle; and the Levites sha2l be mine: I am the LORD. 
And for those that are to be red2emed of the two hundred and thr2escore and thirt2en of the firstborn of the children of Israel, which are more than the Levites; 
Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the po2l, after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them: (the shekel is twenty gerahs:) 
And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the o2d number of them is to be red2emed, unto Aaron and to his sons. 
And Moses t2ok the redemption money of them that were over and above them that were red2emed by the Levites: 
Of the firstborn of the children of Israel t2ok he the money; a thousand thr2e hundred and thr2escore and five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 
And Moses gave the money of them that were red2emed unto Aaron and to his sons, a2cording to the word of the LORD, as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, after their families, by the house of their fathers, 
From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, a2l that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation. 
This sha2l be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation, about the most holy things: 
And when the camp se2teth forward, Aaron sha2l come, and his sons, and they sha2l take down the covering vail, and cover the ark of testimony with it: 
And sha2l put thereon the covering of badgers' skins, and sha2l spread over it a cloth who2ly of blue, and sha2l put in the staves thereof. 
And upon the table of shewbread they sha2l spread a cloth of blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the sp2ons, and the bowls, and covers to cover withal: and the continual bread sha2l be thereon: 
And they sha2l spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the same with a covering of badgers' skins, and sha2l put in the staves thereof. 
And they sha2l take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snu2fdishes, and a2l the oil ve2sels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it: 
And they sha2l put it and a2l the ve2sels thereof within a covering of badgers' skins, and sha2l put it upon a bar. 
And upon the golden altar they sha2l spread a cloth of blue, and cover it with a covering of badgers' skins, and sha2l put to the staves thereof: 
And they sha2l take a2l the instruments of ministry, wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers' skins, and sha2l put them on a bar: 
And they sha2l take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon: 
And they sha2l put upon it a2l the ve2sels thereof, wherewith they minister about it, even the censers, the fles2h2oks, and the shovels, and the basons, a2l the ve2sels of the altar; and they sha2l spread upon it a covering of badgers' skins, and put to the staves of it. 
And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and a2l the ve2sels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath sha2l come to bear it: but they sha2l not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation. 
And to the o2fice of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sw2et incense, and the daily meat o2fering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of a2l the tabernacle, and of a2l that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the ve2sels thereof. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying, 
Cut ye not o2f the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites: 
But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they a2proach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons sha2l go in, and a2point them every one to his service and to his burden: 
But they sha2l not go in to s2e when the holy things are covered, lest they die. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses of their fathers, by their families; 
From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them; a2l that enter in to perform the service, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation. 
This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to serve, and for burdens: 
And they sha2l bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the badgers' skins that is above upon it, and the hanging for the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation, 
And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the d2or of the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, and their cords, and a2l the instruments of their service, and a2l that is made for them: so sha2l they serve. 
At the a2pointment of Aaron and his sons sha2l be a2l the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in a2l their burdens, and in a2l their service: and ye sha2l a2point unto them in charge a2l their burdens. 
This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge sha2l be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 
As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their families, by the house of their fathers; 
From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them, every one that entereth into the service, to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
And this is the charge of their burden, a2cording to a2l their service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pi2lars thereof, and sockets thereof, 
And the pi2lars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords, with a2l their instruments, and with a2l their service: and by name ye sha2l reckon the instruments of the charge of their burden. 
This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, a2cording to a2l their service, in the tabernacle of the congregation, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 
And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites after their families, and after the house of their fathers, 
From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation: 
And those that were numbered of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred and fifty. 
These were they that were numbered of the families of the Kohathites, a2l that might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation, which Moses and Aaron did number a2cording to the co2mandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses. 
And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon, throughout their families, and by the house of their fathers, 
From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation, 
Even those that were numbered of them, throughout their families, by the house of their fathers, were two thousand and six hundred and thirty. 
These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon, of a2l that might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation, whom Moses and Aaron did number a2cording to the co2mandment of the LORD. 
And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, throughout their families, by the house of their fathers, 
From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation, 
Even those that were numbered of them after their families, were thr2e thousand and two hundred. 
These be those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered a2cording to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses. 
A2l those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the chief of Israel numbered, after their families, and after the house of their fathers, 
From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that came to do the service of the ministry, and the service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation. 
Even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore, 
A2cording to the co2mandment of the LORD they were numbered by the hand of Moses, every one a2cording to his service, and a2cording to his burden: thus were they numbered of him, as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Co2mand the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an i2sue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead: 
Both male and female sha2l ye put out, without the camp sha2l ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwe2l. 
And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman sha2l co2mit any sin that men co2mit, to do a trespa2s against the LORD, and that person be guilty; 
Then they sha2l confe2s their sin which they have done: and he sha2l recompense his trespa2s with the principal thereof, and a2d unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hath trespa2sed. 
But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespa2s unto, let the trespa2s be recompensed unto the LORD, even to the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement sha2l be made for him. 
And every o2fering of a2l the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring unto the priest, sha2l be his. 
And every man's ha2lowed things sha2l be his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it sha2l be his. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man's wife go aside, and co2mit a trespa2s against him, 
And a man lie with her carna2ly, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witne2s against her, neither she be taken with the ma2ner; 
And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled: 
Then sha2l the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he sha2l bring her o2fering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he sha2l pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an o2fering of jealousy, an o2fering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance. 
And the priest sha2l bring her near, and set her before the LORD: 
And the priest sha2l take holy water in an earthen ve2sel; and of the dust that is in the fl2or of the tabernacle the priest sha2l take, and put it into the water: 
And the priest sha2l set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman's head, and put the o2fering of memorial in her hands, which is the jealousy o2fering: and the priest sha2l have in his hand the bi2ter water that causeth the curse: 
And the priest sha2l charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, If no man have lain with th2e, and if thou hast not gone aside to unclea2ne2s with another instead of thy husband, be thou fr2e from this bi2ter water that causeth the curse: 
But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with th2e beside thine husband: 
Then the priest sha2l charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest sha2l say unto the woman, The LORD make th2e a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy be2ly to swe2l; 
And this water that causeth the curse sha2l go into thy bowels, to make thy be2ly to swe2l, and thy thigh to rot: And the woman sha2l say, Amen, amen. 
And the priest sha2l write these curses in a b2ok, and he sha2l blot them out with the bi2ter water: 
And he sha2l cause the woman to drink the bi2ter water that causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse sha2l enter into her, and become bi2ter. 
Then the priest sha2l take the jealousy o2fering out of the woman's hand, and sha2l wave the o2fering before the LORD, and o2fer it upon the altar: 
And the priest sha2l take an handful of the o2fering, even the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward sha2l cause the woman to drink the water. 
And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it sha2l come to pa2s, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespa2s against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse sha2l enter into her, and become bi2ter, and her be2ly sha2l swe2l, and her thigh sha2l rot: and the woman sha2l be a curse among her people. 
And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she sha2l be fr2e, and sha2l conceive s2ed. 
This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband, and is defiled; 
Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and sha2l set the woman before the LORD, and the priest sha2l execute upon her a2l this law. 
Then sha2l the man be guiltle2s from iniquity, and this woman sha2l bear her iniquity. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman sha2l separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate themselves unto the LORD: 
He sha2l separate himself from wine and strong drink, and sha2l drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither sha2l he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried. 
A2l the days of his separation sha2l he eat nothing that is made of the vine tr2e, from the kernels even to the husk. 
A2l the days of the vow of his separation there sha2l no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfi2led, in the which he separateth himself unto the LORD, he sha2l be holy, and sha2l let the locks of the hair of his head grow. 
A2l the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he sha2l come at no dead body. 
He sha2l not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God is upon his head. 
A2l the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD. 
And if any man die very su2denly by him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration; then he sha2l shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day sha2l he shave it. 
And on the eighth day he sha2l bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation: 
And the priest sha2l o2fer the one for a sin o2fering, and the other for a burnt o2fering, and make an atonement for him, for that he si2ned by the dead, and sha2l ha2low his head that same day. 
And he sha2l consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation, and sha2l bring a lamb of the first year for a trespa2s o2fering: but the days that were before sha2l be lost, because his separation was defiled. 
And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation are fulfi2led: he sha2l be brought unto the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation: 
And he sha2l o2fer his o2fering unto the LORD, one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt o2fering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin o2fering, and one ram without blemish for peace o2ferings, 
And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat o2fering, and their drink o2ferings. 
And the priest sha2l bring them before the LORD, and sha2l o2fer his sin o2fering, and his burnt o2fering: 
And he sha2l o2fer the ram for a sacrifice of peace o2ferings unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest sha2l o2fer also his meat o2fering, and his drink o2fering. 
And the Nazarite sha2l shave the head of his separation at the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation, and sha2l take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace o2ferings. 
And the priest sha2l take the so2den shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and sha2l put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his separation is shaven: 
And the priest sha2l wave them for a wave o2fering before the LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and heave shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine. 
This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his o2fering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand sha2l get: a2cording to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye sha2l ble2s the children of Israel, saying unto them, 
The LORD ble2s th2e, and k2ep th2e: 
The LORD make his face shine upon th2e, and be gracious unto th2e: 
The LORD lift up his countenance upon th2e, and give th2e peace. 
And they sha2l put my name upon the children of Israel, and I wi2l ble2s them. 
And it came to pa2s on the day that Moses had fu2ly set up the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and a2l the instruments thereof, both the altar and a2l the ve2sels thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them; 
That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who were the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered, o2fered: 
And they brought their o2fering before the LORD, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they brought them before the tabernacle. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man a2cording to his service. 
And Moses t2ok the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites. 
Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, a2cording to their service: 
And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, a2cording unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 
But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders. 
And the princes o2fered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes o2fered their o2fering before the altar. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, They sha2l o2fer their o2fering, each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.

His o2fering was one silver charger of the weight of an hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them fu2l of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat o2fering: 
One golden sp2on of ten shekels, fu2l of incense:

Each charger of silver weighing an hundred and thirty shekels, each bowl seventy: a2l the silver ve2sels weighed two thousand and four hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:

And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation to speak with him, then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him from o2f the mercy seat that was upon the ark of testimony, from betw2en the two cherubims: and he spake unto him. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto Aaron and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps sha2l give light over against the candlestick. 
And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick, as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work: a2cording unto the pa2tern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so he made the candlestick. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them. 
And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of purifying upon them, and let them shave a2l their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean. 
Then let them take a young bu2lock with his meat o2fering, even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bu2lock shalt thou take for a sin o2fering. 
And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole a2sembly of the children of Israel together: 
And thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the children of Israel sha2l put their hands upon the Levites: 
And Aaron sha2l o2fer the Levites before the LORD for an o2fering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the service of the LORD. 
And the Levites sha2l lay their hands upon the heads of the bu2locks: and thou shalt o2fer the one for a sin o2fering, and the other for a burnt o2fering, unto the LORD, to make an atonement for the Levites. 
And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and o2fer them for an o2fering unto the LORD. 
Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel: and the Levites sha2l be mine. 
And after that sha2l the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse them, and o2fer them for an o2fering. 
For they are who2ly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the firstborn of a2l the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me. 
For a2l the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself. 
And I have taken the Levites for a2l the firstborn of the children of Israel. 
And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary. 
And Moses, and Aaron, and a2l the congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites a2cording unto a2l that the LORD co2manded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them. 
And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron o2fered them as an o2fering before the LORD; and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them. 
And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as the LORD had co2manded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
This is it that belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they sha2l go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: 
And from the age of fifty years they sha2l cease waiting upon the service thereof, and sha2l serve no more: 
But sha2l minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation, to k2ep the charge, and sha2l do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderne2s of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, 
Let the children of Israel also k2ep the pa2sover at his a2pointed season. 
In the fourt2enth day of this month, at even, ye sha2l k2ep it in his a2pointed season: a2cording to a2l the rites of it, and a2cording to a2l the ceremonies thereof, sha2l ye k2ep it. 
And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should k2ep the pa2sover. 
And they kept the pa2sover on the fourt2enth day of the first month at even in the wilderne2s of Sinai: a2cording to a2l that the LORD co2manded Moses, so did the children of Israel. 
And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not k2ep the pa2sover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day: 
And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not o2fer an o2fering of the LORD in his a2pointed season among the children of Israel? 
And Moses said unto them, Stand sti2l, and I wi2l hear what the LORD wi2l co2mand concerning you. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity sha2l be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar o2f, yet he sha2l k2ep the pa2sover unto the LORD. 
The fourt2enth day of the second month at even they sha2l k2ep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bi2ter herbs. 
They sha2l leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: a2cording to a2l the ordinances of the pa2sover they sha2l k2ep it. 
But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to k2ep the pa2sover, even the same soul sha2l be cut o2f from among his people: because he brought not the o2fering of the LORD in his a2pointed season, that man sha2l bear his sin. 
And if a stranger sha2l sojourn among you, and wi2l k2ep the pa2sover unto the LORD; a2cording to the ordinance of the pa2sover, and a2cording to the ma2ner thereof, so sha2l he do: ye sha2l have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land. 
And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the a2pearance of fire, until the morning. 
So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the a2pearance of fire by night. 
And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents. 
At the co2mandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the co2mandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents. 
And when the cloud ta2ried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not. 
And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; a2cording to the co2mandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and a2cording to the co2mandment of the LORD they journeyed. 
And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed. 
Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud ta2ried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed. 
At the co2mandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the co2mandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the co2mandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Make th2e two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them for the ca2ling of the a2sembly, and for the journeying of the camps. 
And when they sha2l blow with them, a2l the a2sembly sha2l a2semble themselves to th2e at the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are heads of the thousands of Israel, sha2l gather themselves unto th2e. 
When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts sha2l go forward. 
When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side sha2l take their journey: they sha2l blow an alarm for their journeys. 
But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye sha2l blow, but ye sha2l not sound an alarm. 
And the sons of Aaron, the priests, sha2l blow with the trumpets; and they sha2l be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations. 
And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that o2pre2seth you, then ye sha2l blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye sha2l be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye sha2l be saved from your enemies. 
Also in the day of your gladne2s, and in your solemn days, and in the begi2nings of your months, ye sha2l blow with the trumpets over your burnt o2ferings, and over the sacrifices of your peace o2ferings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God. 
And it came to pa2s on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from o2f the tabernacle of the testimony. 
And the children of Israel t2ok their journeys out of the wilderne2s of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderne2s of Paran. 
And they first t2ok their journey a2cording to the co2mandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses. 
In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah a2cording to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the son of A2minadab. 
And over the host of the tribe of the children of I2sachar was Nethan2el the son of Zuar. 
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon. 
And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle. 
And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward a2cording to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur. 
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurisha2dai. 
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel. 
And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the other did set up the tabernacle against they came. 
And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward a2cording to their armies: and over his host was Elishama the son of A2mihud. 
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Mana2seh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. 
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni. 
And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward, which was the rereward of a2l the camps throughout their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of A2misha2dai. 
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran. 
And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan. 
Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel a2cording to their armies, when they set forward. 
And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said, I wi2l give it you: come thou with us, and we wi2l do th2e g2od: for the LORD hath spoken g2od concerning Israel. 
And he said unto him, I wi2l not go; but I wi2l depart to mine own land, and to my kindred. 
And he said, Leave us not, I pray th2e; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderne2s, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes. 
And it sha2l be, if thou go with us, yea, it sha2l be, that what g2odne2s the LORD sha2l do unto us, the same wi2l we do unto th2e. 
And they departed from the mount of the LORD thr2e days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the thr2e days' journey, to search out a resting place for them. 
And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went out of the camp. 
And it came to pa2s, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be sca2tered; and let them that hate th2e fl2e before th2e. 
And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands of Israel. 
And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the u2termost parts of the camp. 
And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched. 
And he ca2led the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them. 
And the mixt multitude that was among them fe2l a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who sha2l give us flesh to eat? 
We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt fr2ely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the l2eks, and the onions, and the garlick: 
But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at a2l, beside this ma2na, before our eyes. 
And the ma2na was as coriander s2ed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bde2lium. 
And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mi2ls, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil. 
And when the dew fe2l upon the camp in the night, the ma2na fe2l upon it. 
Then Moses heard the people w2ep throughout their families, every man in the d2or of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased. 
And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou a2flicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of a2l this people upon me? 
Have I conceived a2l this people? have I bego2ten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Ca2ry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers? 
Whence should I have flesh to give unto a2l this people? for they w2ep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat. 
I am not able to bear a2l this people alone, because it is t2o heavy for me. 
And if thou deal thus with me, ki2l me, I pray th2e, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not s2e my wretchedne2s. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and o2ficers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with th2e. 
And I wi2l come down and talk with th2e there: and I wi2l take of the spirit which is upon th2e, and wi2l put it upon them; and they sha2l bear the burden of the people with th2e, that thou bear it not thyself alone. 
And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to mo2row, and ye sha2l eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who sha2l give us flesh to eat? for it was we2l with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD wi2l give you flesh, and ye sha2l eat. 
Ye sha2l not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days; 
But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt? 
And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand f2otmen; and thou hast said, I wi2l give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month. 
Sha2l the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to su2fice them? or sha2l a2l the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to su2fice them? 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD'S hand waxed short? thou shalt s2e now whether my word sha2l come to pa2s unto th2e or not. 
And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle. 
And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and t2ok of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pa2s, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease. 
But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were wri2ten, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp. 
And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp. 
And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them. 
And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that a2l the LORD'S people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them! 
And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel. 
And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fa2l by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth. 
And the people st2od up a2l that day, and a2l that night, and a2l the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them a2l abroad for themselves round about the camp. 
And while the flesh was yet betw2en their t2eth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague. 
And he ca2led the name of that place Kibrot2ha2t2avah: because there they buried the people that lusted. 
And the people journeyed from Kibrot2ha2t2avah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth. 
And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had ma2ried: for he had ma2ried an Ethiopian woman. 
And they said, Hath the LORD ind2ed spoken only by Moses? hath he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it. 
(Now the man Moses was very m2ek, above a2l the men which were upon the face of the earth.) 
And the LORD spake su2denly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye thr2e unto the tabernacle of the congregation. And they thr2e came out. 
And the LORD came down in the pi2lar of the cloud, and st2od in the d2or of the tabernacle, and ca2led Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth. 
And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD wi2l make myself known unto him in a vision, and wi2l speak unto him in a dream. 
My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in a2l mine house. 
With him wi2l I speak mouth to mouth, even a2parently, and not in dark sp2eches; and the similitude of the LORD sha2l he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses? 
And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed. 
And the cloud departed from o2f the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron l2oked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous. 
And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I bes2ech th2e, lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done f2olishly, and wherein we have si2ned. 
Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb. 
And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I bes2ech th2e. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again. 
And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not ti2l Miriam was brought in again. 
And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderne2s of Paran. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Send thou men, that they may search the land of Can2an, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers sha2l ye send a man, every one a ruler among them. 
And Moses by the co2mandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderne2s of Paran: a2l those men were heads of the children of Israel. 
And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Sha2mua the son of Za2cur. 
Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. 
Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephu2neh. 
Of the tribe of I2sachar, Igal the son of Joseph. 
Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun. 
Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu. 
Of the tribe of Zebulun, Ga2diel the son of Sodi. 
Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Mana2seh, Ga2di the son of Susi. 
Of the tribe of Dan, A2miel the son of Gema2li. 
Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael. 
Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi. 
Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. 
These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses ca2led Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua. 
And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Can2an, and said unto them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain: 
And s2e the land, what it is, and the people that dwe2leth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many; 
And what the land is that they dwe2l in, whether it be g2od or bad; and what cities they be that they dwe2l in, whether in tents, or in strong holds; 
And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be w2od therein, or not. And be ye of g2od courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes. 
So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderne2s of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath. 
And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 
And they came unto the br2ok of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it betw2en two upon a sta2f; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs. 
The place was ca2led the br2ok Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence. 
And they returned from searching of the land after forty days. 
And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to a2l the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderne2s of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto a2l the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land. 
And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it. 
Neverthele2s the people be strong that dwe2l in the land, and the cities are wa2led, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there. 
The Amalekites dwe2l in the land of the south: and the Hi2tites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwe2l in the mountains: and the Can2anites dwe2l by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan. 
And Caleb sti2led the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and po2se2s it; for we are we2l able to overcome it. 
But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we. 
And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and a2l the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature. 
And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as gra2sho2pers, and so we were in their sight. 
And a2l the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night. 
And a2l the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderne2s! 
And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fa2l by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not be2ter for us to return into Egypt? 
And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt. 
Then Moses and Aaron fe2l on their faces before a2l the a2sembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. 
And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephu2neh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: 
And they spake unto a2l the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we pa2sed through to search it, is an exc2eding g2od land. 
If the LORD delight in us, then he wi2l bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey. 
Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not. 
But a2l the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD a2peared in the tabernacle of the congregation before a2l the children of Israel. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, How long wi2l this people provoke me? and how long wi2l it be ere they believe me, for a2l the signs which I have shewed among them? 
I wi2l smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and wi2l make of th2e a greater nation and mightier than they. 
And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians sha2l hear it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;) 
And they wi2l te2l it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art s2en face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a pi2lar of a cloud, and in a pi2lar of fire by night. 
Now if thou shalt ki2l a2l this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of th2e wi2l speak, saying, 
Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderne2s. 
And now, I bes2ech th2e, let the power of my lord be great, a2cording as thou hast spoken, saying, 
The LORD is longsu2fering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgre2sion, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation. 
Pardon, I bes2ech th2e, the iniquity of this people a2cording unto the greatne2s of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now. 
And the LORD said, I have pardoned a2cording to thy word: 
But as truly as I live, a2l the earth sha2l be fi2led with the glory of the LORD. 
Because a2l those men which have s2en my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderne2s, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; 
Surely they sha2l not s2e the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither sha2l any of them that provoked me s2e it: 
But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath fo2lowed me fu2ly, him wi2l I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his s2ed sha2l po2se2s it. 
(Now the Amalekites and the Can2anites dwelt in the va2ley.) Tomo2row turn you, and get you into the wilderne2s by the way of the Red sea. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
How long sha2l I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me. 
Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so wi2l I do to you: 
Your carcases sha2l fa2l in this wilderne2s; and a2l that were numbered of you, a2cording to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward which have murmured against me. 
Doubtle2s ye sha2l not come into the land, concerning which I sware to make you dwe2l therein, save Caleb the son of Jephu2neh, and Joshua the son of Nun. 
But your li2tle ones, which ye said should be a prey, them wi2l I bring in, and they sha2l know the land which ye have despised. 
But as for you, your carcases, they sha2l fa2l in this wilderne2s. 
And your children sha2l wander in the wilderne2s forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderne2s. 
After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, sha2l ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye sha2l know my breach of promise. 
I the LORD have said, I wi2l surely do it unto a2l this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderne2s they sha2l be consumed, and there they sha2l die. 
And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made a2l the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land, 
Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD. 
But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephu2neh, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived sti2l. 
And Moses told these sayings unto a2l the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly. 
And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and wi2l go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have si2ned. 
And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgre2s the co2mandment of the LORD? but it sha2l not prosper. 
Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smi2ten before your enemies. 
For the Amalekites and the Can2anites are there before you, and ye sha2l fa2l by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD wi2l not be with you. 
But they presumed to go up unto the hi2l top: neverthele2s the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. 
Then the Amalekites came down, and the Can2anites which dwelt in that hi2l, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you, 
And wi2l make an o2fering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt o2fering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a fr2ewi2l o2fering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sw2et savour unto the LORD, of the herd or of the flock: 
Then sha2l he that o2fereth his o2fering unto the LORD bring a meat o2fering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil. 
And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink o2fering shalt thou prepare with the burnt o2fering or sacrifice, for one lamb. 
Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat o2fering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil. 
And for a drink o2fering thou shalt o2fer the third part of an hin of wine, for a sw2et savour unto the LORD. 
And when thou preparest a bu2lock for a burnt o2fering, or for a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace o2ferings unto the LORD: 
Then sha2l he bring with a bu2lock a meat o2fering of thr2e tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil. 
And thou shalt bring for a drink o2fering half an hin of wine, for an o2fering made by fire, of a sw2et savour unto the LORD. 
Thus sha2l it be done for one bu2lock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid. 
A2cording to the number that ye sha2l prepare, so sha2l ye do to every one a2cording to their number. 
A2l that are born of the country sha2l do these things after this ma2ner, in o2fering an o2fering made by fire, of a sw2et savour unto the LORD. 
And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in your generations, and wi2l o2fer an o2fering made by fire, of a sw2et savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he sha2l do. 
One ordinance sha2l be both for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations: as ye are, so sha2l the stranger be before the LORD. 
One law and one ma2ner sha2l be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you, 
Then it sha2l be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye sha2l o2fer up an heave o2fering unto the LORD. 
Ye sha2l o2fer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave o2fering: as ye do the heave o2fering of the threshingfl2or, so sha2l ye heave it. 
Of the first of your dough ye sha2l give unto the LORD an heave o2fering in your generations. 
And if ye have e2red, and not observed a2l these co2mandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses, 
Even a2l that the LORD hath co2manded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD co2manded Moses, and henceforward among your generations; 
Then it sha2l be, if ought be co2mi2ted by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that a2l the congregation sha2l o2fer one young bu2lock for a burnt o2fering, for a sw2et savour unto the LORD, with his meat o2fering, and his drink o2fering, a2cording to the ma2ner, and one kid of the goats for a sin o2fering. 
And the priest sha2l make an atonement for a2l the congregation of the children of Israel, and it sha2l be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they sha2l bring their o2fering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin o2fering before the LORD, for their ignorance: 
And it sha2l be forgiven a2l the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; s2eing a2l the people were in ignorance. 
And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he sha2l bring a she goat of the first year for a sin o2fering. 
And the priest sha2l make an atonement for the soul that si2neth ignorantly, when he si2neth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it sha2l be forgiven him. 
Ye sha2l have one law for him that si2neth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them. 
But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that soul sha2l be cut o2f from among his people. 
Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his co2mandment, that soul sha2l u2terly be cut o2f; his iniquity sha2l be upon him. 
And while the children of Israel were in the wilderne2s, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sa2bath day. 
And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto a2l the congregation. 
And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, The man sha2l be surely put to death: a2l the congregation sha2l stone him with stones without the camp. 
And a2l the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ri2band of blue: 
And it sha2l be unto you for a fringe, that ye may l2ok upon it, and remember a2l the co2mandments of the LORD, and do them ; and that ye s2ek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring: 
That ye may remember, and do a2l my co2mandments, and be holy unto your God. 
I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God. 
Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, t2ok men: 
And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the a2sembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown: 
And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take t2o much upon you, s2eing a2l the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD? 
And when Moses heard it, he fe2l upon his face: 
And he spake unto Korah and unto a2l his company, saying, Even to mo2row the LORD wi2l shew who are his, and who is holy; and wi2l cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath chosen wi2l he cause to come near unto him. 
This do; Take you censers, Korah, and a2l his company; 
And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to mo2row: and it sha2l be that the man whom the LORD doth ch2ose, he sha2l be holy: ye take t2o much upon you, ye sons of Levi. 
And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi: 
S2emeth it but a sma2l thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them? 
And he hath brought th2e near to him, and a2l thy brethren the sons of Levi with th2e: and s2ek ye the priesth2od also? 
For which cause both thou and a2l thy company are gathered together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him? 
And Moses sent to ca2l Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We wi2l not come up: 
Is it a sma2l thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to ki2l us in the wilderne2s, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us? 
Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we wi2l not come up. 
And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not thou their o2fering: I have not taken one a2s from them, neither have I hurt one of them. 
And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and a2l thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to mo2row: 
And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each of you his censer. 
And they t2ok every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and st2od in the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron. 
And Korah gathered a2l the congregation against them unto the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD a2peared unto a2l the congregation. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. 
And they fe2l upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of a2l flesh, sha2l one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with a2l the congregation? 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. 
And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel fo2lowed him. 
And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of their's, lest ye be consumed in a2l their sins. 
So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and st2od in the d2or of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their li2tle children. 
And Moses said, Hereby ye sha2l know that the LORD hath sent me to do a2l these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind. 
If these men die the co2mon death of a2l men, or if they be visited after the visitation of a2l men; then the LORD hath not sent me. 
But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swa2low them up, with a2l that a2pertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye sha2l understand that these men have provoked the LORD. 
And it came to pa2s, as he had made an end of speaking a2l these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them: 
And the earth opened her mouth, and swa2lowed them up, and their houses, and a2l the men that a2pertained unto Korah, and a2l their g2ods. 
They, and a2l that a2pertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation. 
And a2l Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swa2low us up also. 
And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that o2fered incense. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and sca2ter thou the fire yonder; for they are ha2lowed. 
The censers of these si2ners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they o2fered them before the LORD, therefore they are ha2lowed: and they sha2l be a sign unto the children of Israel. 
And Eleazar the priest t2ok the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had o2fered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar: 
To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the s2ed of Aaron, come near to o2fer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses. 
But on the mo2row a2l the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have ki2led the people of the LORD. 
And it came to pa2s, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they l2oked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD a2peared. 
And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fe2l upon their faces. 
And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from o2f the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun. 
And Aaron t2ok as Moses co2manded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people. 
And he st2od betw2en the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed. 
Now they that died in the plague were fourt2en thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the ma2ter of Korah. 
And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod a2cording to the house of their fathers, of a2l their princes a2cording to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod. 
And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod sha2l be for the head of the house of their fathers. 
And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I wi2l m2et with you. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that the man's rod, whom I sha2l ch2ose, sha2l blo2som: and I wi2l make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you. 
And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, a2cording to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods. 
And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witne2s. 
And it came to pa2s, that on the mo2row Moses went into the tabernacle of witne2s; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was bu2ded, and brought forth buds, and bl2omed blo2soms, and yielded almonds. 
And Moses brought out a2l the rods from before the LORD unto a2l the children of Israel: and they l2oked, and t2ok every man his rod. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not. 
And Moses did so: as the LORD co2manded him, so did he. 
And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we a2l perish. 
Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD sha2l die: sha2l we be consumed with dying? 
And the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with th2e sha2l bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with th2e sha2l bear the iniquity of your priesth2od. 
And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with th2e, that they may be joined unto th2e, and minister unto th2e: but thou and thy sons with th2e sha2l minister before the tabernacle of witne2s. 
And they sha2l k2ep thy charge, and the charge of a2l the tabernacle: only they sha2l not come nigh the ve2sels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die. 
And they sha2l be joined unto th2e, and k2ep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for a2l the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger sha2l not come nigh unto you. 
And ye sha2l k2ep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel. 
And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
Therefore thou and thy sons with th2e sha2l k2ep your priest's o2fice for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and ye sha2l serve: I have given your priest's o2fice unto you as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh sha2l be put to death. 
And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given th2e the charge of mine heave o2ferings of a2l the ha2lowed things of the children of Israel; unto th2e have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever. 
This sha2l be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of their's, every meat o2fering of their's, and every sin o2fering of their's, and every trespa2s o2fering of their's which they sha2l render unto me, sha2l be most holy for th2e and for thy sons. 
In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male sha2l eat it: it sha2l be holy unto th2e. 
And this is thine; the heave o2fering of their gift, with a2l the wave o2ferings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto th2e, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with th2e, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house sha2l eat of it. 
A2l the best of the oil, and a2l the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they sha2l o2fer unto the LORD, them have I given th2e. 
And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they sha2l bring unto the LORD, sha2l be thine; every one that is clean in thine house sha2l eat of it. 
Every thing devoted in Israel sha2l be thine. 
Every thing that openeth the matrix in a2l flesh, which they bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, sha2l be thine: neverthele2s the firstborn of man shalt thou surely red2em, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou red2em. 
And those that are to be red2emed from a month old shalt thou red2em, a2cording to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs. 
But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sh2ep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not red2em; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their bl2od upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an o2fering made by fire, for a sw2et savour unto the LORD. 
And the flesh of them sha2l be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine. 
A2l the heave o2ferings of the holy things, which the children of Israel o2fer unto the LORD, have I given th2e, and thy sons and thy daughters with th2e, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto th2e and to thy s2ed with th2e. 
And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel. 
And, behold, I have given the children of Levi a2l the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die. 
But the Levites sha2l do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they sha2l bear their iniquity: it sha2l be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance. 
But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they o2fer as an heave o2fering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they sha2l have no inheritance. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye sha2l o2fer up an heave o2fering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe. 
And this your heave o2fering sha2l be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshingfl2or, and as the fulne2s of the winepre2s. 
Thus ye also sha2l o2fer an heave o2fering unto the LORD of a2l your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye sha2l give thereof the LORD'S heave o2fering to Aaron the priest. 
Out of a2l your gifts ye sha2l o2fer every heave o2fering of the LORD, of a2l the best thereof, even the ha2lowed part thereof out of it. 
Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it sha2l be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfl2or, and as the increase of the winepre2s. 
And ye sha2l eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation. 
And ye sha2l bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither sha2l ye po2lute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath co2manded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring th2e a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke: 
And ye sha2l give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one sha2l slay her before his face: 
And Eleazar the priest sha2l take of her bl2od with his finger, and sprinkle of her bl2od directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times: 
And one sha2l burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her bl2od, with her dung, sha2l he burn: 
And the priest sha2l take cedar w2od, and hy2sop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer. 
Then the priest sha2l wash his clothes, and he sha2l bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he sha2l come into the camp, and the priest sha2l be unclean until the even. 
And he that burneth her sha2l wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and sha2l be unclean until the even. 
And a man that is clean sha2l gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it sha2l be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin. 
And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer sha2l wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it sha2l be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever. 
He that toucheth the dead body of any man sha2l be unclean seven days. 
He sha2l purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he sha2l be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he sha2l not be clean. 
Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul sha2l be cut o2f from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he sha2l be unclean; his unclea2ne2s is yet upon him. 
This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: a2l that come into the tent, and a2l that is in the tent, sha2l be unclean seven days. 
And every open ve2sel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean. 
And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, sha2l be unclean seven days. 
And for an unclean person they sha2l take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and ru2ning water sha2l be put thereto in a ve2sel: 
And a clean person sha2l take hy2sop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon a2l the ve2sels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave: 
And the clean person sha2l sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he sha2l purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and sha2l be clean at even. 
But the man that sha2l be unclean, and sha2l not purify himself, that soul sha2l be cut o2f from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath not b2en sprinkled upon him; he is unclean. 
And it sha2l be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation sha2l wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation sha2l be unclean until even. 
And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth sha2l be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it sha2l be unclean until even. 
Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there. 
And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. 
And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD! 
And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderne2s, that we and our ca2tle should die there? 
And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of s2ed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink. 
And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the a2sembly unto the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fe2l upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD a2peared unto them. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Take the rod, and gather thou the a2sembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it sha2l give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink. 
And Moses t2ok the rod from before the LORD, as he co2manded him. 
And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock? 
And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye sha2l not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them. 
This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them. 
And Moses sent me2sengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest a2l the travail that hath befa2len us: 
How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers: 
And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the u2termost of thy border: 
Let us pa2s, I pray th2e, through thy country: we wi2l not pa2s through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither wi2l we drink of the water of the we2ls: we wi2l go by the king's high way, we wi2l not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have pa2sed thy borders. 
And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pa2s by me, lest I come out against th2e with the sword. 
And the children of Israel said unto him, We wi2l go by the high way: and if I and my ca2tle drink of thy water, then I wi2l pay for it: I wi2l only, without doing anything else, go through on my f2et. 
And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand. 
Thus Edom refused to give Israel pa2sage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him. 
And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying, 
Aaron sha2l be gathered unto his people: for he sha2l not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebe2led against my word at the water of Meribah. 
Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor: 
And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron sha2l be gathered unto his people, and sha2l die there. 
And Moses did as the LORD co2manded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of a2l the congregation. 
And Moses stri2ped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount. 
And when a2l the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even a2l the house of Israel. 
And when king Arad the Can2anite, which dwelt in the south, heard te2l that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and t2ok some of them prisoners. 
And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt ind2ed deliver this people into my hand, then I wi2l u2terly destroy their cities. 
And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Can2anites; and they u2terly destroyed them and their cities: and he ca2led the name of the place Hormah. 
And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compa2s the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way. 
And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderne2s? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread. 
And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died. 
Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have si2ned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against th2e; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Make th2e a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it sha2l come to pa2s, that every one that is bi2ten, when he l2oketh upon it, sha2l live. 
And Moses made a serpent of bra2s, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pa2s, that if a serpent had bi2ten any man, when he beheld the serpent of bra2s, he lived. 
And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth. 
And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderne2s which is before Moab, toward the sunrising. 
From thence they removed, and pitched in the va2ley of Zared. 
From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderne2s that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, betw2en Moab and the Amorites. 
Wherefore it is said in the b2ok of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the br2oks of Arnon, 
And at the stream of the br2oks that goeth down to the dwe2ling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab. 
And from thence they went to B2er: that is the we2l whereof the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I wi2l give them water. 
Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O we2l; sing ye unto it: 
The princes di2ged the we2l, the nobles of the people di2ged it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderne2s they went to Ma2tanah: 
And from Ma2tanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth: 
And from Bamoth in the va2ley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which l2oketh toward Jeshimon. 
And Israel sent me2sengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, 
Let me pa2s through thy land: we wi2l not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we wi2l not drink of the waters of the we2l: but we wi2l go along by the king's high way, until we be past thy borders. 
And Sihon would not su2fer Israel to pa2s through his border: but Sihon gathered a2l his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderne2s: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel. 
And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and po2se2sed his land from Arnon unto Ja2bok, even unto the children of A2mon: for the border of the children of A2mon was strong. 
And Israel t2ok a2l these cities: and Israel dwelt in a2l the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in a2l the vi2lages thereof. 
For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken a2l his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon. 
Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared: 
For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon. 
Woe to th2e, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites. 
We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba. 
Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites. 
And Moses sent to spy out J2azer, and they t2ok the vi2lages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there. 
And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and og the king of bashan went out against them, he, and a2l his people, to the ba2tle at edrei. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and a2l his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. 
So they smote him, and his sons, and a2l his people, until there was none left him alive: and they po2se2sed his land. 
And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho. 
And Balak the son of Zi2por saw a2l that Israel had done to the Amorites. 
And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distre2sed because of the children of Israel. 
And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now sha2l this company lick up a2l that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the gra2s of the field. And Balak the son of Zi2por was king of the Moabites at that time. 
He sent me2sengers therefore unto Bal2am the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to ca2l him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me: 
Come now therefore, I pray th2e, curse me this people; for they are t2o mighty for me: peradventure I sha2l prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou ble2sest is ble2sed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed. 
And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Bal2am, and spake unto him the words of Balak. 
And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I wi2l bring you word again, as the LORD sha2l speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Bal2am. 
And God came unto Bal2am, and said, What men are these with th2e? 
And Bal2am said unto God, Balak the son of Zi2por, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying, 
Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I sha2l be able to overcome them, and drive them out. 
And God said unto Bal2am, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they are ble2sed. 
And Bal2am rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you. 
And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Bal2am refuseth to come with us. 
And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they. 
And they came to Bal2am, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zi2por, Let nothing, I pray th2e, hinder th2e from coming unto me: 
For I wi2l promote th2e unto very great honour, and I wi2l do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray th2e, curse me this people. 
And Bal2am answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house fu2l of silver and gold, I ca2not go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do le2s or more. 
Now therefore, I pray you, ta2ry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD wi2l say unto me more. 
And God came unto Bal2am at night, and said unto him, If the men come to ca2l th2e, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I sha2l say unto th2e, that shalt thou do. 
And Bal2am rose up in the morning, and sa2dled his a2s, and went with the princes of Moab. 
And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD st2od in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his a2s, and his two servants were with him. 
And the a2s saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the a2s turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Bal2am smote the a2s, to turn her into the way. 
But the angel of the LORD st2od in a path of the vineyards, a wa2l being on this side, and a wa2l on that side. 
And when the a2s saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wa2l, and crushed Bal2am's f2ot against the wa2l: and he smote her again. 
And the angel of the LORD went further, and st2od in a na2row place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. 
And when the a2s saw the angel of the LORD, she fe2l down under Bal2am: and Bal2am's anger was kindled, and he smote the a2s with a sta2f. 
And the LORD opened the mouth of the a2s, and she said unto Bal2am, What have I done unto th2e, that thou hast smi2ten me these thr2e times? 
And Bal2am said unto the a2s, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I ki2l th2e. 
And the a2s said unto Bal2am, Am not I thine a2s, upon which thou hast ri2den ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto th2e? and he said, Nay. 
Then the LORD opened the eyes of Bal2am, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fe2l flat on his face. 
And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smi2ten thine a2s these thr2e times? behold, I went out to withstand th2e, because thy way is perverse before me: 
And the a2s saw me, and turned from me these thr2e times: unle2s she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain th2e, and saved her alive. 
And Bal2am said unto the angel of the LORD, I have si2ned; for I knew not that thou st2odest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease th2e, I wi2l get me back again. 
And the angel of the LORD said unto Bal2am, Go with the men: but only the word that I sha2l speak unto th2e, that thou shalt speak. So Bal2am went with the princes of Balak. 
And when Balak heard that Bal2am was come, he went out to m2et him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast. 
And Balak said unto Bal2am, Did I not earnestly send unto th2e to ca2l th2e? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able ind2ed to promote th2e to honour? 
And Bal2am said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto th2e: have I now any power at a2l to say any thing? the word that God pu2teth in my mouth, that sha2l I speak. 
And Bal2am went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjat2huzoth. 
And Balak o2fered oxen and sh2ep, and sent to Bal2am, and to the princes that were with him. 
And it came to pa2s on the mo2row, that Balak t2ok Bal2am, and brought him up into the high places of B2al, that thence he might s2e the utmost part of the people. 
And Bal2am said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams. 
And Balak did as Bal2am had spoken; and Balak and Bal2am o2fered on every altar a bu2lock and a ram. 
And Bal2am said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt o2fering, and I wi2l go: peradventure the LORD wi2l come to m2et me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I wi2l te2l th2e. And he went to an high place. 
And God met Bal2am: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have o2fered upon every altar a bu2lock and a ram. 
And the LORD put a word in Bal2am's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak. 
And he returned unto him, and, lo, he st2od by his burnt sacrifice, he, and a2l the princes of Moab. 
And he t2ok up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel. 
How sha2l I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how sha2l I defy, whom the LORD hath not defied? 
For from the top of the rocks I s2e him, and from the hi2ls I behold him: lo, the people sha2l dwe2l alone, and sha2l not be reckoned among the nations. 
Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his! 
And Balak said unto Bal2am, What hast thou done unto me? I t2ok th2e to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast ble2sed them altogether. 
And he answered and said, Must I not take h2ed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth? 
And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray th2e, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest s2e them: thou shalt s2e but the utmost part of them, and shalt not s2e them a2l: and curse me them from thence. 
And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and o2fered a bu2lock and a ram on every altar. 
And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt o2fering, while I m2et the LORD yonder. 
And the LORD met Bal2am, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus. 
And when he came to him, behold, he st2od by his burnt o2fering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken? 
And he t2ok up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zi2por: 
God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and sha2l he not do it? or hath he spoken, and sha2l he not make it g2od? 
Behold, I have received co2mandment to ble2s: and he hath ble2sed; and I ca2not reverse it. 
He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he s2en perversene2s in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them. 
God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn. 
Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: a2cording to this time it sha2l be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought! 
Behold, the people sha2l rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he sha2l not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the bl2od of the slain. 
And Balak said unto Bal2am, Neither curse them at a2l, nor ble2s them at a2l. 
But Bal2am answered and said unto Balak, Told not I th2e, saying, A2l that the LORD speaketh, that I must do? 
And Balak said unto Bal2am, Come, I pray th2e, I wi2l bring th2e unto another place; peradventure it wi2l please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence. 
And Balak brought Bal2am unto the top of Peor, that l2oketh toward jeshimon. 
And Bal2am said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bu2locks and seven rams. 
And Balak did as Bal2am had said, and o2fered a bu2lock and a ram on every altar. 
And when Bal2am saw that it pleased the LORD to ble2s Israel, he went not, as at other times, to s2ek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderne2s. 
And Bal2am lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents a2cording to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him. 
And he t2ok up his parable, and said, Bal2am the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 
He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, fa2ling into a trance, but having his eyes open: 
How g2odly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel! 
As the va2leys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the tr2es of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, and as cedar tr2es beside the waters. 
He sha2l pour the water out of his buckets, and his s2ed sha2l be in many waters, and his king sha2l be higher than Agag, and his kingdom sha2l be exalted. 
God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he sha2l eat up the nations his enemies, and sha2l break their bones, and pierce them through with his a2rows. 
He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who sha2l stir him up? Ble2sed is he that ble2seth th2e, and cursed is he that curseth th2e. 
And Balak's anger was kindled against Bal2am, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Bal2am, I ca2led th2e to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether ble2sed them these thr2e times. 
Therefore now fl2e thou to thy place: I thought to promote th2e unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept th2e back from honour. 
And Bal2am said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy me2sengers which thou sentest unto me, saying, 
If Balak would give me his house fu2l of silver and gold, I ca2not go beyond the co2mandment of the LORD, to do either g2od or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that wi2l I speak? 
And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I wi2l advertise th2e what this people sha2l do to thy people in the la2ter days. 
And he t2ok up his parable, and said, Bal2am the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 
He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, fa2ling into a trance, but having his eyes open: 
I sha2l s2e him, but not now: I sha2l behold him, but not nigh: there sha2l come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre sha2l rise out of Israel, and sha2l smite the corners of Moab, and destroy a2l the children of Sheth. 
And Edom sha2l be a po2se2sion, Seir also sha2l be a po2se2sion for his enemies; and Israel sha2l do valiantly. 
Out of Jacob sha2l come he that sha2l have dominion, and sha2l destroy him that remaineth of the city. 
And when he l2oked on Amalek, he t2ok up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his la2ter end sha2l be that he perish for ever. 
And he l2oked on the Kenites, and t2ok up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwe2lingplace, and thou pu2test thy nest in a rock. 
Neverthele2s the Kenite sha2l be wasted, until A2shur sha2l ca2ry th2e away captive. 
And he t2ok up his parable, and said, Alas, who sha2l live when God doeth this! 
And ships sha2l come from the coast of Chi2tim, and sha2l a2flict A2shur, and sha2l a2flict Eber, and he also sha2l perish for ever. 
And Bal2am rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way. 
And Israel abode in Shi2tim, and the people began to co2mit whoredom with the daughters of Moab. 
And they ca2led the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods. 
And Israel joined himself unto B2alpeor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Take a2l the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel. 
And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto B2alpeor. 
And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of a2l the congregation of the children of Israel, who were w2eping before the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and t2ok a javelin in his hand; 
And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her be2ly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel. 
And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy. 
Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace: 
And he sha2l have it, and his s2ed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesth2od; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel. 
Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites. 
And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Vex the Midianites, and smite them: 
For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the ma2ter of Peor, and in the ma2ter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake. 
And it came to pa2s after the plague, that the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying, 
Take the sum of a2l the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their fathers' house, a2l that are able to go to war in Israel. 
And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying, 
Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward; as the LORD co2manded Moses and the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt. 
Reuben, the eldest son of Israel: the children of Reuben; Hanoch, of whom cometh the family of the Hanochites: of Pa2lu, the family of the Pa2luites: 
Of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites: of Carmi, the family of the Carmites. 
These are the families of the Reubenites: and they that were numbered of them were forty and thr2e thousand and seven hundred and thirty. 
And the sons of Pa2lu; Eliab. 
And the sons of Eliab; Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram. This is that Dathan and Abiram, which were famous in the congregation, who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they strove against the LORD: 
And the earth opened her mouth, and swa2lowed them up together with Korah, when that company died, what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men: and they became a sign. 
Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not. 
The sons of Simeon after their families: of Nemuel, the family of the Nemuelites: of Jamin, the family of the Jaminites: of Jachin, the family of the Jachinites: 
Of Zerah, the family of the Zarhites: of Shaul, the family of the Shaulites. 
These are the families of the Simeonites, twenty and two thousand and two hundred. 
The children of Gad after their families: of Zephon, the family of the Zephonites: of Ha2gi, the family of the Ha2gites: of Shuni, the family of the Shunites: 
Of Ozni, the family of the Oznites: of Eri, the family of the Erites: 
Of Arod, the family of the Arodites: of Areli, the family of the Arelites. 
These are the families of the children of Gad a2cording to those that were numbered of them, forty thousand and five hundred. 
The sons of Judah were Er and Onan: and Er and Onan died in the land of Can2an.

And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Unto these the land sha2l be divided for an inheritance a2cording to the number of names. 
To many thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to few thou shalt give the le2s inheritance: to every one sha2l his inheritance be given a2cording to those that were numbered of him. 
Notwithstanding the land sha2l be divided by lot: a2cording to the names of the tribes of their fathers they sha2l inherit. 
A2cording to the lot sha2l the po2se2sion thereof be divided betw2en many and few. 
And these are they that were numbered of the Levites after their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites: of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites: of Merari, the family of the Merarites.

And unto Aaron was born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
And Nadab and Abihu died, when they o2fered strange fire before the LORD. 
And those that were numbered of them were twenty and thr2e thousand, a2l males from a month old and upward: for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel. 
These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho. 
But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderne2s of Sinai. 
For the LORD had said of them, They sha2l surely die in the wilderne2s. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephu2neh, and Joshua the son of Nun. 
Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Mana2seh, of the families of Mana2seh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah. 
And they st2od before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and a2l the congregation, by the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, 
Our father died in the wilderne2s, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons. 
Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a po2se2sion among the brethren of our father. 
And Moses brought their cause before the LORD. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a po2se2sion of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pa2s unto them. 
And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye sha2l cause his inheritance to pa2s unto his daughter. 
And if he have no daughter, then ye sha2l give his inheritance unto his brethren. 
And if he have no brethren, then ye sha2l give his inheritance unto his father's brethren. 
And if his father have no brethren, then ye sha2l give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he sha2l po2se2s it: and it sha2l be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Get th2e up into this mount Abarim, and s2e the land which I have given unto the children of Israel. 
And when thou hast s2en it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered. 
For ye rebe2led against my co2mandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderne2s of Zin. 
And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying, 
Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of a2l flesh, set a man over the congregation, 
Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sh2ep which have no shepherd. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Take th2e Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him; 
And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before a2l the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight. 
And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that a2l the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient. 
And he sha2l stand before Eleazar the priest, who sha2l ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word sha2l they go out, and at his word they sha2l come in, both he, and a2l the children of Israel with him, even a2l the congregation. 
And Moses did as the LORD co2manded him: and he t2ok Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before a2l the congregation: 
And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD co2manded by the hand of Moses. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Co2mand the children of Israel, and say unto them, My o2fering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sw2et savour unto me, sha2l ye observe to o2fer unto me in their due season. 
And thou shalt say unto them, This is the o2fering made by fire which ye sha2l o2fer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt o2fering. 
The one lamb shalt thou o2fer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou o2fer at even; 
And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat o2fering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil. 
It is a continual burnt o2fering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sw2et savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD. 
And the drink o2fering thereof sha2l be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the LORD for a drink o2fering. 
And the other lamb shalt thou o2fer at even: as the meat o2fering of the morning, and as the drink o2fering thereof, thou shalt o2fer it, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sw2et savour unto the LORD. 
And on the sa2bath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a meat o2fering, mingled with oil, and the drink o2fering thereof: 
This is the burnt o2fering of every sa2bath, beside the continual burnt o2fering, and his drink o2fering. 
And in the begi2nings of your months ye sha2l o2fer a burnt o2fering unto the LORD; two young bu2locks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot; 
And thr2e tenth deals of flour for a meat o2fering, mingled with oil, for one bu2lock; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat o2fering, mingled with oil, for one ram; 
And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat o2fering unto one lamb; for a burnt o2fering of a sw2et savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD. 
And their drink o2ferings sha2l be half an hin of wine unto a bu2lock, and the third part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth part of an hin unto a lamb: this is the burnt o2fering of every month throughout the months of the year. 
And one kid of the goats for a sin o2fering unto the LORD sha2l be o2fered, beside the continual burnt o2fering, and his drink o2fering. 
And in the fourt2enth day of the first month is the pa2sover of the LORD. 
And in the fift2enth day of this month is the feast: seven days sha2l unleavened bread be eaten. 
In the first day sha2l be an holy convocation; ye sha2l do no ma2ner of servile work therein: 
But ye sha2l o2fer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt o2fering unto the LORD; two young bu2locks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year: they sha2l be unto you without blemish: 
And their meat o2fering sha2l be of flour mingled with oil: thr2e tenth deals sha2l ye o2fer for a bu2lock, and two tenth deals for a ram; 
A several tenth deal shalt thou o2fer for every lamb, throughout the seven lambs: 
And one goat for a sin o2fering, to make an atonement for you. 
Ye sha2l o2fer these beside the burnt o2fering in the morning, which is for a continual burnt o2fering. 
After this ma2ner ye sha2l o2fer daily, throughout the seven days, the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sw2et savour unto the LORD: it sha2l be o2fered beside the continual burnt o2fering, and his drink o2fering. 
And on the seventh day ye sha2l have an holy convocation; ye sha2l do no servile work. 
Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat o2fering unto the LORD, after your w2eks be out, ye sha2l have an holy convocation; ye sha2l do no servile work: 
But ye sha2l o2fer the burnt o2fering for a sw2et savour unto the LORD; two young bu2locks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year; 
And their meat o2fering of flour mingled with oil, thr2e tenth deals unto one bu2lock, two tenth deals unto one ram, 
A several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven lambs; 
And one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you. 
Ye sha2l o2fer them beside the continual burnt o2fering, and his meat o2fering, (they sha2l be unto you without blemish) and their drink o2ferings. 
And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye sha2l have an holy convocation; ye sha2l do no servile work: it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you. 
And ye sha2l o2fer a burnt o2fering for a sw2et savour unto the LORD; one young bu2lock, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year without blemish: 
And their meat o2fering sha2l be of flour mingled with oil, thr2e tenth deals for a bu2lock, and two tenth deals for a ram, 
And one tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs: 
And one kid of the goats for a sin o2fering, to make an atonement for you: 
Beside the burnt o2fering of the month, and his meat o2fering, and the daily burnt o2fering, and his meat o2fering, and their drink o2ferings, a2cording unto their ma2ner, for a sw2et savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD. 
And ye sha2l have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy convocation; and ye sha2l a2flict your souls: ye sha2l not do any work therein: 
But ye sha2l o2fer a burnt o2fering unto the LORD for a sw2et savour; one young bu2lock, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year; they sha2l be unto you without blemish: 
And their meat o2fering sha2l be of flour mingled with oil, thr2e tenth deals to a bu2lock, and two tenth deals to one ram, 
A several tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs: 
One kid of the goats for a sin o2fering; beside the sin o2fering of atonement, and the continual burnt o2fering, and the meat o2fering of it, and their drink o2ferings. 
And on the fift2enth day of the seventh month ye sha2l have an holy convocation; ye sha2l do no servile work, and ye sha2l k2ep a feast unto the LORD seven days: 
And ye sha2l o2fer a burnt o2fering, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sw2et savour unto the LORD; thirt2en young bu2locks, two rams, and fourt2en lambs of the first year; they sha2l be without blemish: 
And their meat o2fering sha2l be of flour mingled with oil, thr2e tenth deals unto every bu2lock of the thirt2en bu2locks, two tenth deals to each ram of the two rams, 
And a several tenth deal to each lamb of the fourt2en lambs: 
And one kid of the goats for a sin o2fering; beside the continual burnt o2fering, his meat o2fering, and his drink o2fering. 
And on the second day ye sha2l o2fer twelve young bu2locks, two rams, fourt2en lambs of the first year without spot: 
And their meat o2fering and their drink o2ferings for the bu2locks, for the rams, and for the lambs, sha2l be a2cording to their number, after the ma2ner: 
And one kid of the goats for a sin o2fering; beside the continual burnt o2fering, and the meat o2fering thereof, and their drink o2ferings. 
And on the third day eleven bu2locks, two rams, fourt2en lambs of the first year without blemish;

And one goat for a sin o2fering; beside the continual burnt o2fering, and his meat o2fering, and his drink o2fering. 
And on the fourth day ten bu2locks, two rams, and fourt2en lambs of the first year without blemish:

These things ye sha2l do unto the LORD in your set feasts, beside your vows, and your fr2ewi2l o2ferings, for your burnt o2ferings, and for your meat o2ferings, and for your drink o2ferings, and for your peace o2ferings. 
And Moses told the children of Israel a2cording to a2l that the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD hath co2manded. 
If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he sha2l not break his word, he sha2l do a2cording to a2l that proc2edeth out of his mouth. 
If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth; 
And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father sha2l hold his peace at her; then a2l her vows sha2l stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul sha2l stand. 
But if her father disa2low her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, sha2l stand: and the LORD sha2l forgive her, because her father disa2lowed her. 
And if she had at a2l an husband, when she vowed, or u2tered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul; 
And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her vows sha2l stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul sha2l stand. 
But if her husband disa2lowed her on the day that he heard it; then he sha2l make her vow which she vowed, and that which she u2tered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none e2fect: and the LORD sha2l forgive her. 
But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, sha2l stand against her. 
And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath; 
And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disa2lowed her not: then a2l her vows sha2l stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul sha2l stand. 
But if her husband hath u2terly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proc2eded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, sha2l not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD sha2l forgive her. 
Every vow, and every binding oath to a2flict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void. 
But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth a2l her vows, or a2l her bonds, which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them. 
But if he sha2l any ways make them void after that he hath heard them; then he sha2l bear her iniquity. 
These are the statutes, which the LORD co2manded Moses, betw2en a man and his wife, betw2en the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth in her father's house. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people. 
And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian. 
Of every tribe a thousand, throughout a2l the tribes of Israel, sha2l ye send to the war. 
So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. 
And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand. 
And they wa2red against the Midianites, as the LORD co2manded Moses; and they slew a2l the males. 
And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Bal2am also the son of Beor they slew with the sword. 
And the children of Israel t2ok a2l the women of Midian captives, and their li2tle ones, and t2ok the spoil of a2l their ca2tle, and a2l their flocks, and a2l their g2ods. 
And they burnt a2l their cities wherein they dwelt, and a2l their g2odly castles, with fire. 
And they t2ok a2l the spoil, and a2l the prey, both of men and of beasts. 
And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho. 
And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and a2l the princes of the congregation, went forth to m2et them without the camp. 
And Moses was wroth with the o2ficers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the ba2tle. 
And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved a2l the women alive? 
Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Bal2am, to co2mit trespa2s against the LORD in the ma2ter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD. 
Now therefore ki2l every male among the li2tle ones, and ki2l every woman that hath known man by lying with him. 
But a2l the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, k2ep alive for yourselves. 
And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath ki2led any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day. 
And purify a2l your raiment, and a2l that is made of skins, and a2l work of goats' hair, and a2l things made of w2od. 
And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the ba2tle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD co2manded Moses; 
Only the gold, and the silver, the bra2s, the iron, the tin, and the lead, 
Every thing that may abide the fire, ye sha2l make it go through the fire, and it sha2l be clean: neverthele2s it sha2l be purified with the water of separation: and a2l that abideth not the fire ye sha2l make go through the water. 
And ye sha2l wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye sha2l be clean, and afterward ye sha2l come into the camp. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation: 
And divide the prey into two parts; betw2en them that t2ok the war upon them, who went out to ba2tle, and betw2en a2l the congregation: 
And levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went out to ba2tle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the b2eves, and of the a2ses, and of the sh2ep: 
Take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for an heave o2fering of the LORD. 
And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the b2eves, of the a2ses, and of the flocks, of a2l ma2ner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which k2ep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD. 
And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And the b2oty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sh2ep, 
And thr2escore and twelve thousand b2eves, 
And thr2escore and one thousand a2ses, 
And thirty and two thousand persons in a2l, of women that had not known man by lying with him. 
And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number thr2e hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sh2ep: 
And the LORD'S tribute of the sh2ep was six hundred and thr2escore and fift2en. 
And the b2eves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD'S tribute was thr2escore and twelve. 
And the a2ses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD'S tribute was thr2escore and one. 
And the persons were sixt2en thousand; of which the LORD'S tribute was thirty and two persons. 
And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD'S heave o2fering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the men that wa2red, 
(Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was thr2e hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sh2ep, 
And thirty and six thousand b2eves, 
And thirty thousand a2ses and five hundred, 
And sixt2en thousand persons;) 
Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses t2ok one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And the o2ficers which were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses: 
And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us. 
We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath go2ten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, ea2rings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD. 
And Moses and Eleazar the priest t2ok the gold of them, even a2l wrought jewels. 
And a2l the gold of the o2fering that they o2fered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixt2en thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels. 
(For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.) 
And Moses and Eleazar the priest t2ok the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD. 
Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of ca2tle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for ca2tle; 
The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying, 
Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon, 
Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for ca2tle, and thy servants have ca2tle: 
Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a po2se2sion, and bring us not over Jordan. 
And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Sha2l your brethren go to war, and sha2l ye sit here? 
And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them? 
Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to s2e the land. 
For when they went up unto the va2ley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them. 
And the LORD'S anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying, 
Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, sha2l s2e the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Is2ac, and unto Jacob; because they have not who2ly fo2lowed me: 
Save Caleb the son of Jephu2neh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have who2ly fo2lowed the LORD. 
And the LORD'S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderne2s forty years, until a2l the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed. 
And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel. 
For if ye turn away from after him, he wi2l yet again leave them in the wilderne2s; and ye sha2l destroy a2l this people. 
And they came near unto him, and said, We wi2l build sh2epfolds here for our ca2tle, and cities for our li2tle ones: 
But we ourselves wi2l go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our li2tle ones sha2l dwe2l in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land. 
We wi2l not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance. 
For we wi2l not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fa2len to us on this side Jordan eastward. 
And Moses said unto them, If ye wi2l do this thing, if ye wi2l go armed before the LORD to war, 
And wi2l go a2l of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him, 
And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye sha2l return, and be guiltle2s before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land sha2l be your po2se2sion before the LORD. 
But if ye wi2l not do so, behold, ye have si2ned against the LORD: and be sure your sin wi2l find you out. 
Build you cities for your li2tle ones, and folds for your sh2ep; and do that which hath proc2eded out of your mouth. 
And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants wi2l do as my lord co2mandeth. 
Our li2tle ones, our wives, our flocks, and a2l our ca2tle, sha2l be there in the cities of Gilead: 
But thy servants wi2l pa2s over, every man armed for war, before the Lord to ba2tle, as my lord saith. 
So concerning them Moses co2manded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel: 
And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben wi2l pa2s with you over Jordan, every man armed to ba2tle, before the LORD, and the land sha2l be subdued before you; then ye sha2l give them the land of Gilead for a po2se2sion: 
But if they wi2l not pa2s over with you armed, they sha2l have po2se2sions among you in the land of Can2an. 
And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so wi2l we do. 
We wi2l pa2s over armed before the LORD into the land of Can2an, that the po2se2sion of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be our's. 
And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Mana2seh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country round about. 
And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer, 
And Atroth, Shophan, and J2azer, and Jogbehah, 
And Bethnimrah, and Bet2haran, fenced cities: and folds for sh2ep. 
And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim, 
And Nebo, and B2almeon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded. 
And the children of Machir the son of Mana2seh went to Gilead, and t2ok it, and dispo2se2sed the Amorite which was in it. 
And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Mana2seh; and he dwelt therein. 
And Jair the son of Mana2seh went and t2ok the sma2l towns thereof, and ca2led them Havothjair. 
And Nobah went and t2ok Kenath, and the vi2lages thereof, and ca2led it Nobah, after his own name. 
These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron. 
And Moses wrote their goings out a2cording to their journeys by the co2mandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys a2cording to their goings out. 
And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fift2enth day of the first month; on the mo2row after the pa2sover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of a2l the Egyptians. 
For the Egyptians buried a2l their firstborn, which the LORD had smi2ten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments. 
And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in Su2coth. 
And they departed from Su2coth, and pitched in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderne2s. 
And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pihahiroth, which is before B2alzephon: and they pitched before Migdol. 
And they departed from before Pihahiroth, and pa2sed through the midst of the sea into the wilderne2s, and went thr2e days'journey in the wilderne2s of Etham, and pitched in Marah. 
And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim were twelve fountains of water, and thr2escore and ten palm tr2es; and they pitched there. 
And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea. 
And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the wilderne2s of Sin. 
And they t2ok their journey out of the wilderne2s of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah. 
And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush. 
And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drink. 
And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderne2s of Sinai. 
And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and pitched at Kibrot2ha2t2avah. 
And they departed from Kibrot2ha2t2avah, and encamped at Hazeroth. 
And they departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah. 
And they departed from Rithmah, and pitched at Ri2monparez. 
And they departed from Ri2monparez, and pitched in Libnah. 
And they removed from Libnah, and pitched at Ri2sah. 
And they journeyed from Ri2sah, and pitched in Kehelathah. 
And they went from Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher. 
And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah. 
And they removed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth. 
And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath. 
And they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah. 
And they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah. 
And they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah. 
And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth. 
And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Benej2akan. 
And they removed from Benej2akan, and encamped at Horhagidgad. 
And they went from Horhagidgad, and pitched in Jotbathah. 
And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah. 
And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Eziongaber. 
And they removed from Eziongaber, and pitched in the wilderne2s of Zin, which is Kadesh. 
And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom. 
And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the co2mandment of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first day of the fifth month. 
And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and thr2e years old when he died in mount Hor. 
And king Arad the Can2anite, which dwelt in the south in the land of Can2an, heard of the coming of the children of Israel. 
And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah. 
And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon. 
And they departed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth. 
And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Ijeabarim, in the border of Moab. 
And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibongad. 
And they removed from Dibongad, and encamped in Almondiblathaim. 
And they removed from Almondiblathaim, and pitched in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo. 
And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho. 
And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even unto Abelshi2tim in the plains of Moab. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are pa2sed over Jordan into the land of Can2an; 
Then ye sha2l drive out a2l the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy a2l their pictures, and destroy a2l their molten images, and quite pluck down a2l their high places: 
And ye sha2l dispo2se2s the inhabitants of the land, and dwe2l therein: for I have given you the land to po2se2s it. 
And ye sha2l divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more ye sha2l give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye sha2l give the le2s inheritance: every man's inheritance sha2l be in the place where his lot fa2leth; a2cording to the tribes of your fathers ye sha2l inherit. 
But if ye wi2l not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it sha2l come to pa2s, that those which ye let remain of them sha2l be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and sha2l vex you in the land wherein ye dwe2l. 
Moreover it sha2l come to pa2s, that I sha2l do unto you, as I thought to do unto them. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Co2mand the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Can2an; (this is the land that sha2l fa2l unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Can2an with the coasts thereof:) 
Then your south quarter sha2l be from the wilderne2s of Zin along by the coast of Edom, and your south border sha2l be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward: 
And your border sha2l turn from the south to the ascent of Akra2bim, and pa2s on to Zin: and the going forth thereof sha2l be from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and sha2l go on to Hazara2dar, and pa2s on to Azmon: 
And the border sha2l fetch a compa2s from Azmon unto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it sha2l be at the sea. 
And as for the western border, ye sha2l even have the great sea for a border: this sha2l be your west border. 
And this sha2l be your north border: from the great sea ye sha2l point out for you mount Hor: 
From mount Hor ye sha2l point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border sha2l be to Zedad: 
And the border sha2l go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it sha2l be at Hazarenan: this sha2l be your north border. 
And ye sha2l point out your east border from Hazarenan to Shepham: 
And the coast sha2l go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border sha2l descend, and sha2l reach unto the side of the sea of Chi2nereth eastward: 
And the border sha2l go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it sha2l be at the salt sea: this sha2l be your land with the coasts thereof round about. 
And Moses co2manded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye sha2l inherit by lot, which the LORD co2manded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe: 
For the tribe of the children of Reuben a2cording to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad a2cording to the house of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of Mana2seh have received their inheritance: 
The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
These are the names of the men which sha2l divide the land unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun. 
And ye sha2l take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by inheritance. 
And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephu2neh. 
And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of A2mihud. 
Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon. 
And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bu2ki the son of Jogli. 
The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children of Mana2seh, Ha2niel the son of Ephod. 
And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan. 
And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach. 
And the prince of the tribe of the children of I2sachar, Paltiel the son of A2zan. 
And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi. 
And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son of A2mihud. 
These are they whom the LORD co2manded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Can2an. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying, 
Co2mand the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their po2se2sion cities to dwe2l in; and ye sha2l give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them. 
And the cities sha2l they have to dwe2l in; and the suburbs of them sha2l be for their ca2tle, and for their g2ods, and for a2l their beasts. 
And the suburbs of the cities, which ye sha2l give unto the Levites, sha2l reach from the wa2l of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about. 
And ye sha2l measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city sha2l be in the midst: this sha2l be to them the suburbs of the cities. 
And among the cities which ye sha2l give unto the Levites there sha2l be six cities for refuge, which ye sha2l a2point for the manslayer, that he may fl2e thither: and to them ye sha2l a2d forty and two cities. 
So a2l the cities which ye sha2l give to the Levites sha2l be forty and eight cities: them sha2l ye give with their suburbs. 
And the cities which ye sha2l give sha2l be of the po2se2sion of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye sha2l give many; but from them that have few ye sha2l give few: every one sha2l give of his cities unto the Levites a2cording to his inheritance which he inheriteth. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Can2an; 
Then ye sha2l a2point you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may fl2e thither, which ki2leth any person at unawares. 
And they sha2l be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment. 
And of these cities which ye sha2l give six cities sha2l ye have for refuge. 
Ye sha2l give thr2e cities on this side Jordan, and thr2e cities sha2l ye give in the land of Can2an, which sha2l be cities of refuge. 
These six cities sha2l be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that ki2leth any person unawares may fl2e thither. 
And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer sha2l surely be put to death. 
And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer sha2l surely be put to death. 
Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of w2od, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer sha2l surely be put to death. 
The revenger of bl2od himself sha2l slay the murderer: when he m2eteth him, he sha2l slay him. 
But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die; 
Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote him sha2l surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of bl2od sha2l slay the murderer, when he m2eteth him. 
But if he thrust him su2denly without enmity, or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait, 
Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, s2eing him not, and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm: 
Then the congregation sha2l judge betw2en the slayer and the revenger of bl2od a2cording to these judgments: 
And the congregation sha2l deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of bl2od, and the congregation sha2l restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he sha2l abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil. 
But if the slayer sha2l at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled; 
And the revenger of bl2od find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of bl2od ki2l the slayer; he sha2l not be guilty of bl2od: 
Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer sha2l return into the land of his po2se2sion. 
So these things sha2l be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in a2l your dwe2lings. 
Whoso ki2leth any person, the murderer sha2l be put to death by the mouth of witne2ses: but one witne2s sha2l not testify against any person to cause him to die. 
Moreover ye sha2l take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he sha2l be surely put to death. 
And ye sha2l take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwe2l in the land, until the death of the priest. 
So ye sha2l not po2lute the land wherein ye are: for bl2od it defileth the land: and the land ca2not be cleansed of the bl2od that is shed therein, but by the bl2od of him that shed it. 
Defile not therefore the land which ye sha2l inhabit, wherein I dwe2l: for I the LORD dwe2l among the children of Israel. 
And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Mana2seh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel: 
And they said, The LORD co2manded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was co2manded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters. 
And if they be ma2ried to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then sha2l their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and sha2l be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so sha2l it be taken from the lot of our inheritance. 
And when the jubile of the children of Israel sha2l be, then sha2l their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so sha2l their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers. 
And Moses co2manded the children of Israel a2cording to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said we2l. 
This is the thing which the LORD doth co2mand concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them ma2ry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father sha2l they ma2ry. 
So sha2l not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel sha2l k2ep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. 
And every daughter, that po2se2seth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, sha2l be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers. 
Neither sha2l the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel sha2l k2ep himself to his own inheritance. 
Even as the LORD co2manded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad: 
For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were ma2ried unto their fathers brothers' sons: 
And they were ma2ried into the families of the sons of Mana2seh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father. 
These are the co2mandments and the judgments, which the LORD co2manded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho. 
These be the words which Moses spake unto a2l Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderne2s, in the plain over against the Red sea, betw2en Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab. 
(There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.) 
And it came to pa2s in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, a2cording unto a2l that the LORD had given him in co2mandment unto them; 
After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei: 
On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying, 
The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount: 
Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto a2l the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hi2ls, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Can2anites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates. 
Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and po2se2s the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Is2ac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their s2ed after them. 
And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone: 
The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude. 
(The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and ble2s you, as he hath promised you!) 
How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife? 
Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I wi2l make them rulers over you. 
And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is g2od for us to do. 
So I t2ok the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and o2ficers among your tribes. 
And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes betw2en your brethren, and judge righteously betw2en every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him. 
Ye sha2l not respect persons in judgment; but ye sha2l hear the sma2l as we2l as the great; ye sha2l not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is t2o hard for you, bring it unto me, and I wi2l hear it. 
And I co2manded you at that time a2l the things which ye should do. 
And when we departed from Horeb, we went through a2l that great and te2rible wilderne2s, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God co2manded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea. 
And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us. 
Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before th2e: go up and po2se2s it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto th2e; fear not, neither be discouraged. 
And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We wi2l send men before us, and they sha2l search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we sha2l come. 
And the saying pleased me we2l: and I t2ok twelve men of you, one of a tribe: 
And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the va2ley of Eshcol, and searched it out. 
And they t2ok of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a g2od land which the LORD our God doth give us. 
Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebe2led against the co2mandment of the LORD your God: 
And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. 
Whither sha2l we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and ta2ler than we; the cities are great and wa2led up to heaven; and moreover we have s2en the sons of the Anakims there. 
Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them. 
The LORD your God which goeth before you, he sha2l fight for you, a2cording to a2l that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes; 
And in the wilderne2s, where thou hast s2en how that the LORD thy God bare th2e, as a man doth bear his son, in a2l the way that ye went, until ye came into this place. 
Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God, 
Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day. 
And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying, 
Surely there sha2l not one of these men of this evil generation s2e that g2od land, which I sware to give unto your fathers. 
Save Caleb the son of Jephu2neh; he sha2l s2e it, and to him wi2l I give the land that he hath tro2den upon, and to his children, because he hath who2ly fo2lowed the LORD. 
Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither. 
But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before th2e, he sha2l go in thither: encourage him: for he sha2l cause Israel to inherit it. 
Moreover your li2tle ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge betw2en g2od and evil, they sha2l go in thither, and unto them wi2l I give it, and they sha2l po2se2s it. 
But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderne2s by the way of the Red sea. 
Then ye answered and said unto me, We have si2ned against the LORD, we wi2l go up and fight, a2cording to a2l that the LORD our God co2manded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hi2l. 
And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smi2ten before your enemies. 
So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebe2led against the co2mandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hi2l. 
And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as b2es do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah. 
And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you. 
So ye abode in Kadesh many days, a2cording unto the days that ye abode there. 
Then we turned, and t2ok our journey into the wilderne2s by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compa2sed mount Seir many days. 
And the LORD spake unto me, saying, 
Ye have compa2sed this mountain long enough: turn you northward. 
And co2mand thou the people, saying, Ye are to pa2s through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwe2l in Seir; and they sha2l be afraid of you: take ye g2od h2ed unto yourselves therefore: 
Me2dle not with them; for I wi2l not give you of their land, no, not so much as a f2ot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a po2se2sion. 
Ye sha2l buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye sha2l also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink. 
For the LORD thy God hath ble2sed th2e in a2l the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderne2s: these forty years the LORD thy God hath b2en with th2e; thou hast lacked nothing. 
And when we pa2sed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and pa2sed by the way of the wilderne2s of Moab. 
And the LORD said unto me, Distre2s not the Moabites, neither contend with them in ba2tle: for I wi2l not give th2e of their land for a po2se2sion; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a po2se2sion. 
The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and ta2l, as the Anakims; 
Which also were a2counted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites ca2led them Emims. 
The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau su2c2eded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his po2se2sion, which the LORD gave unto them. 
Now rise up, said I, and get you over the br2ok Zered. And we went over the br2ok Zered. 
And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the br2ok Zered, was thirty and eight years; until a2l the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them. 
For ind2ed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed. 
So it came to pa2s, when a2l the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, 
That the LORD spake unto me, saying, 
Thou art to pa2s over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day: 
And when thou comest nigh over against the children of A2mon, distre2s them not, nor me2dle with them: for I wi2l not give th2e of the land of the children of A2mon any po2se2sion; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a po2se2sion. 
(That also was a2counted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the A2monites ca2l them Zamzu2mims; 
A people great, and many, and ta2l, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they su2c2eded them, and dwelt in their stead: 
As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they su2c2eded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day: 
And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto A2zah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.) 
Rise ye up, take your journey, and pa2s over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to po2se2s it, and contend with him in ba2tle. 
This day wi2l I begin to put the dread of th2e and the fear of th2e upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who sha2l hear report of th2e, and sha2l tremble, and be in anguish because of th2e. 
And I sent me2sengers out of the wilderne2s of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 
Let me pa2s through thy land: I wi2l go along by the high way, I wi2l neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left. 
Thou shalt se2l me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I wi2l pa2s through on my f2et; 
(As the children of Esau which dwe2l in Seir, and the Moabites which dwe2l in Ar, did unto me;) until I sha2l pa2s over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us. 
But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pa2s by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as a2peareth this day. 
And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before th2e: begin to po2se2s, that thou mayest inherit his land. 
Then Sihon came out against us, he and a2l his people, to fight at Jahaz. 
And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and a2l his people. 
And we t2ok a2l his cities at that time, and u2terly destroyed the men, and the women, and the li2tle ones, of every city, we left none to remain: 
Only the ca2tle we t2ok for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we t2ok. 
From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city t2o strong for us: the LORD our God delivered a2l unto us: 
Only unto the land of the children of A2mon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Ja2bok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us. 
Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and a2l his people, to ba2tle at Edrei. 
And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I wi2l deliver him, and a2l his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. 
So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and a2l his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining. 
And we t2ok a2l his cities at that time, there was not a city which we t2ok not from them, thr2escore cities, a2l the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
A2l these cities were fenced with high wa2ls, gates, and bars; beside unwa2led towns a great many. 
And we u2terly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, u2terly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city. 
But a2l the ca2tle, and the spoil of the cities, we t2ok for a prey to ourselves. 
And we t2ok at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon; 
(Which Hermon the Sidonians ca2l Sirion; and the Amorites ca2l it Shenir;) 
A2l the cities of the plain, and a2l Gilead, and a2l Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Ra2bath of the children of A2mon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man. 
And this land, which we po2se2sed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites. 
And the rest of Gilead, and a2l Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Mana2seh; a2l the region of Argob, with a2l Bashan, which was ca2led the land of giants. 
Jair the son of Mana2seh t2ok a2l the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and M2achathi; and ca2led them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day. 
And I gave Gilead unto Machir. 
And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the va2ley, and the border even unto the river Ja2bok, which is the border of the children of A2mon; 
The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chi2nereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward. 
And I co2manded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to po2se2s it: ye sha2l pa2s over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, a2l that are m2et for the war. 
But your wives, and your li2tle ones, and your ca2tle, (for I know that ye have much ca2tle,) sha2l abide in your cities which I have given you; 
Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as we2l as unto you, and until they also po2se2s the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then sha2l ye return every man unto his po2se2sion, which I have given you. 
And I co2manded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have s2en a2l that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so sha2l the LORD do unto a2l the kingdoms whither thou pa2sest. 
Ye sha2l not fear them: for the LORD your God he sha2l fight for you. 
And I besought the LORD at that time, saying, 
O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatne2s, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do a2cording to thy works, and a2cording to thy might? 
I pray th2e, let me go over, and s2e the g2od land that is beyond Jordan, that g2odly mountain, and Lebanon. 
But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it su2fice th2e; speak no more unto me of this ma2ter. 
Get th2e up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan. 
But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he sha2l go over before this people, and he sha2l cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt s2e. 
So we abode in the va2ley over against Bethpeor. 
Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and po2se2s the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you. 
Ye sha2l not a2d unto the word which I co2mand you, neither sha2l ye diminish ought from it, that ye may k2ep the co2mandments of the LORD your God which I co2mand you. 
Your eyes have s2en what the LORD did because of B2alpeor: for a2l the men that fo2lowed B2alpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you. 
But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day. 
Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God co2manded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to po2se2s it. 
K2ep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which sha2l hear a2l these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people. 
For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in a2l things that we ca2l upon him for? 
And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as a2l this law, which I set before you this day? 
Only take h2ed to thyself, and k2ep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have s2en, and lest they depart from thy heart a2l the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons; 
Specia2ly the day that thou st2odest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I wi2l make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me a2l the days that they sha2l live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children. 
And ye came near and st2od under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkne2s, clouds, and thick darkne2s. 
And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice. 
And he declared unto you his covenant, which he co2manded you to perform, even ten co2mandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone. 
And the LORD co2manded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to po2se2s it. 
Take ye therefore g2od h2ed unto yourselves; for ye saw no ma2ner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire: 
Lest ye co2rupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likene2s of male or female, 
The likene2s of any beast that is on the earth, the likene2s of any winged fowl that flieth in the air, 
The likene2s of any thing that cr2epeth on the ground, the likene2s of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth: 
And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou s2est the sun, and the m2on, and the stars, even a2l the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto a2l nations under the whole heaven. 
But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day. 
Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that g2od land, which the LORD thy God giveth th2e for an inheritance: 
But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye sha2l go over, and po2se2s that g2od land. 
Take h2ed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likene2s of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbi2den th2e. 
For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God. 
When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye sha2l have remained long in the land, and sha2l co2rupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likene2s of any thing, and sha2l do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger: 
I ca2l heaven and earth to witne2s against you this day, that ye sha2l s2on u2terly perish from o2f the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to po2se2s it; ye sha2l not prolong your days upon it, but sha2l u2terly be destroyed. 
And the LORD sha2l sca2ter you among the nations, and ye sha2l be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD sha2l lead you. 
And there ye sha2l serve gods, the work of men's hands, w2od and stone, which neither s2e, nor hear, nor eat, nor sme2l. 
But if from thence thou shalt s2ek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou s2ek him with a2l thy heart and with a2l thy soul. 
When thou art in tribulation, and a2l these things are come upon th2e, even in the la2ter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice; 
(For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he wi2l not forsake th2e, neither destroy th2e, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them. 
For ask now of the days that are past, which were before th2e, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath b2en any such thing as this great thing is, or hath b2en heard like it? 
Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? 
Or hath God a2sayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great te2rors, a2cording to a2l that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? 
Unto th2e it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him. 
Out of heaven he made th2e to hear his voice, that he might instruct th2e: and upon earth he shewed th2e his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire. 
And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their s2ed after them, and brought th2e out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt; 
To drive out nations from before th2e greater and mightier than thou art, to bring th2e in, to give th2e their land for an inheritance, as it is this day. 
Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else. 
Thou shalt k2ep therefore his statutes, and his co2mandments, which I co2mand th2e this day, that it may go we2l with th2e, and with thy children after th2e, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth th2e, for ever. 
Then Moses severed thr2e cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising; 
That the slayer might fl2e thither, which should ki2l his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fl2eing unto one of these cities he might live: 
Namely, Bezer in the wilderne2s, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Mana2sites. 
And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel: 
These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt. 
On this side Jordan, in the va2ley over against Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt: 
And they po2se2sed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising; 
From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon, 
And a2l the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah. 
And Moses ca2led a2l Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and k2ep, and do them. 
The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb. 
The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are a2l of us here alive this day. 
The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire, 
(I st2od betw2en the LORD and you at that time, to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying, 
I am the LORD thy God, which brought th2e out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. 
Thou shalt have none other gods before me. 
Thou shalt not make th2e any graven image, or any likene2s of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth: 
Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, 
And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and k2ep my co2mandments. 
Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD wi2l not hold him guiltle2s that taketh his name in vain. 
K2ep the sa2bath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath co2manded th2e. 
Six days thou shalt labour, and do a2l thy work: 
But the seventh day is the sa2bath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine a2s, nor any of thy ca2tle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as we2l as thou. 
And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy God brought th2e out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God co2manded th2e to k2ep the sa2bath day. 
Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath co2manded th2e; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go we2l with th2e, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth th2e. 
Thou shalt not ki2l. 
Neither shalt thou co2mit adultery. 
Neither shalt thou steal. 
Neither shalt thou bear false witne2s against thy neighbour. 
Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his a2s, or any thing that is thy neighbour's. 
These words the LORD spake unto a2l your a2sembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkne2s, with a great voice: and he a2ded no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me. 
And it came to pa2s, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkne2s, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, even a2l the heads of your tribes, and your elders; 
And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatne2s, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have s2en this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth. 
Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire wi2l consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we sha2l die. 
For who is there of a2l flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? 
Go thou near, and hear a2l that the LORD our God sha2l say: and speak thou unto us a2l that the LORD our God sha2l speak unto th2e; and we wi2l hear it, and do it. 
And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto th2e: they have we2l said a2l that they have spoken. 
O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and k2ep a2l my co2mandments always, that it might be we2l with them, and with their children for ever! 
Go say to them, Get you into your tents again. 
But as for th2e, stand thou here by me, and I wi2l speak unto th2e a2l the co2mandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to po2se2s it. 
Ye sha2l observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath co2manded you: ye sha2l not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. 
Ye sha2l walk in a2l the ways which the LORD your God hath co2manded you, that ye may live, and that it may be we2l with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye sha2l po2se2s. 
Now these are the co2mandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD your God co2manded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to po2se2s it: 
That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to k2ep a2l his statutes and his co2mandments, which I co2mand th2e, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, a2l the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged. 
Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be we2l with th2e, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised th2e, in the land that floweth with milk and honey. 
Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD: 
And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with a2l thine heart, and with a2l thy soul, and with a2l thy might. 
And these words, which I co2mand th2e this day, sha2l be in thine heart: 
And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou si2test in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. 
And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they sha2l be as frontlets betw2en thine eyes. 
And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates. 
And it sha2l be, when the LORD thy God sha2l have brought th2e into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Is2ac, and to Jacob, to give th2e great and g2odly cities, which thou buildedst not, 
And houses fu2l of a2l g2od things, which thou fi2ledst not, and we2ls di2ged, which thou di2gedst not, vineyards and olive tr2es, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be fu2l; 
Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought th2e forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. 
Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name. 
Ye sha2l not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are round about you; 
(For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against th2e, and destroy th2e from o2f the face of the earth. 
Ye sha2l not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in Ma2sah. 
Ye sha2l diligently k2ep the co2mandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath co2manded th2e. 
And thou shalt do that which is right and g2od in the sight of the LORD: that it may be we2l with th2e, and that thou mayest go in and po2se2s the g2od land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers. 
To cast out a2l thine enemies from before th2e, as the LORD hath spoken. 
And when thy son asketh th2e in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath co2manded you? 
Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand: 
And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon a2l his household, before our eyes: 
And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers. 
And the LORD co2manded us to do a2l these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our g2od always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day. 
And it sha2l be our righteousne2s, if we observe to do a2l these co2mandments before the LORD our God, as he hath co2manded us. 
When the LORD thy God sha2l bring th2e into the land whither thou goest to po2se2s it, and hath cast out many nations before th2e, the Hi2tites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Can2anites, and the Peri2zites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou; 
And when the LORD thy God sha2l deliver them before th2e; thou shalt smite them, and u2terly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them: 
Neither shalt thou make ma2riages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son. 
For they wi2l turn away thy son from fo2lowing me, that they may serve other gods: so wi2l the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy th2e su2denly. 
But thus sha2l ye deal with them; ye sha2l destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire. 
For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen th2e to be a special people unto himself, above a2l people that are upon the face of the earth. 
The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor ch2ose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of a2l people: 
But because the LORD loved you, and because he would k2ep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and red2emed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 
Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which k2epeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and k2ep his co2mandments to a thousand generations; 
And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he wi2l not be slack to him that hateth him, he wi2l repay him to his face. 
Thou shalt therefore k2ep the co2mandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I co2mand th2e this day, to do them. 
Wherefore it sha2l come to pa2s, if ye hearken to these judgments, and k2ep, and do them, that the LORD thy God sha2l k2ep unto th2e the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers: 
And he wi2l love th2e, and ble2s th2e, and multiply th2e: he wi2l also ble2s the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sh2ep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give th2e. 
Thou shalt be ble2sed above a2l people: there sha2l not be male or female ba2ren among you, or among your ca2tle. 
And the LORD wi2l take away from th2e a2l sickne2s, and wi2l put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon th2e; but wi2l lay them upon a2l them that hate th2e. 
And thou shalt consume a2l the people which the LORD thy God sha2l deliver th2e; thine eye sha2l have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that wi2l be a snare unto th2e. 
If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispo2se2s them? 
Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt we2l remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto a2l Egypt; 
The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought th2e out: so sha2l the LORD thy God do unto a2l the people of whom thou art afraid. 
Moreover the LORD thy God wi2l send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from th2e, be destroyed. 
Thou shalt not be a2frighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and te2rible. 
And the LORD thy God wi2l put out those nations before th2e by li2tle and li2tle: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon th2e. 
But the LORD thy God sha2l deliver them unto th2e, and sha2l destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed. 
And he sha2l deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there sha2l no man be able to stand before th2e, until thou have destroyed them. 
The graven images of their gods sha2l ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto th2e, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God. 
Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt u2terly detest it, and thou shalt u2terly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing. 
A2l the co2mandments which I co2mand th2e this day sha2l ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and po2se2s the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers. 
And thou shalt remember a2l the way which the LORD thy God led th2e these forty years in the wilderne2s, to humble th2e, and to prove th2e, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest k2ep his co2mandments, or no. 
And he humbled th2e, and su2fered th2e to hunger, and fed th2e with ma2na, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make th2e know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proc2edeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live. 
Thy raiment waxed not old upon th2e, neither did thy f2ot swe2l, these forty years. 
Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth th2e. 
Therefore thou shalt k2ep the co2mandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him. 
For the LORD thy God bringeth th2e into a g2od land, a land of br2oks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of va2leys and hi2ls; 
A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig tr2es, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; 
A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarcene2s, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hi2ls thou mayest dig bra2s. 
When thou hast eaten and art fu2l, then thou shalt ble2s the LORD thy God for the g2od land which he hath given th2e. 
Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not k2eping his co2mandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I co2mand th2e this day: 
Lest when thou hast eaten and art fu2l, and hast built g2odly houses, and dwelt therein; 
And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and a2l that thou hast is multiplied; 
Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought th2e forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage; 
Who led th2e through that great and te2rible wilderne2s, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought th2e forth water out of the rock of flint; 
Who fed th2e in the wilderne2s with ma2na, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble th2e, and that he might prove th2e, to do th2e g2od at thy la2ter end; 
And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath go2ten me this wealth. 
But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth th2e power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day. 
And it sha2l be, if thou do at a2l forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye sha2l surely perish. 
As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so sha2l ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD your God. 
Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pa2s over Jordan this day, to go in to po2se2s nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven, 
A people great and ta2l, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak! 
Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before th2e; as a consuming fire he sha2l destroy them, and he sha2l bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto th2e. 
Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before th2e, saying, For my righteousne2s the LORD hath brought me in to po2se2s this land: but for the wickedne2s of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before th2e. 
Not for thy righteousne2s, or for the uprightne2s of thine heart, dost thou go to po2se2s their land: but for the wickedne2s of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before th2e, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Is2ac, and Jacob. 
Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth th2e not this g2od land to po2se2s it for thy righteousne2s; for thou art a sti2fnecked people. 
Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderne2s: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have b2en rebe2lious against the LORD. 
Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you. 
When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water: 
And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone wri2ten with the finger of God; and on them was wri2ten a2cording to a2l the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the a2sembly. 
And it came to pa2s at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant. 
And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get th2e down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have co2rupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I co2manded them; they have made them a molten image. 
Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have s2en this people, and, behold, it is a sti2fnecked people: 
Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I wi2l make of th2e a nation mightier and greater than they. 
So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands. 
And I l2oked, and, behold, ye had si2ned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had co2manded you. 
And I t2ok the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes. 
And I fe2l down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of a2l your sins which ye si2ned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. 
For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also. 
And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time. 
And I t2ok your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very sma2l, even until it was as sma2l as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the br2ok that descended out of the mount. 
And at Taberah, and at Ma2sah, and at Kibrot2ha2t2avah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath. 
Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and po2se2s the land which I have given you; then ye rebe2led against the co2mandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice. 
Ye have b2en rebe2lious against the LORD from the day that I knew you. 
Thus I fe2l down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fe2l down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you. 
I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast red2emed through thy greatne2s, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 
Remember thy servants, Abraham, Is2ac, and Jacob; l2ok not unto the stu2bor2ne2s of this people, nor to their wickedne2s, nor to their sin: 
Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderne2s. 
Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm. 
At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew th2e two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make th2e an ark of w2od. 
And I wi2l write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark. 
And I made an ark of shi2tim w2od, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand. 
And he wrote on the tables, a2cording to the first writing, the ten co2mandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the a2sembly: and the LORD gave them unto me. 
And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD co2manded me. 
And the children of Israel t2ok their journey from B2eroth of the children of J2akan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's o2fice in his stead. 
From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters. 
At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto him, and to ble2s in his name, unto this day. 
Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD is his inheritance, a2cording as the LORD thy God promised him. 
And I stayed in the mount, a2cording to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy th2e. 
And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people, that they may go in and po2se2s the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them. 
And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of th2e, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in a2l his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with a2l thy heart and with a2l thy soul, 
To k2ep the co2mandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I co2mand th2e this day for thy g2od? 
Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's thy God, the earth also, with a2l that therein is. 
Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their s2ed after them, even you above a2l people, as it is this day. 
Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more sti2fnecked. 
For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a te2rible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward: 
He doth execute the judgment of the fatherle2s and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him f2od and raiment. 
Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 
Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name. 
He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for th2e these great and te2rible things, which thine eyes have s2en. 
Thy fathers went down into Egypt with thr2escore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made th2e as the stars of heaven for multitude. 
Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and k2ep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his co2mandments, alway. 
And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not s2en the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatne2s, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm, 
And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto a2l his land; 
And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day; 
And what he did unto you in the wilderne2s, until ye came into this place; 
And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swa2lowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and a2l the substance that was in their po2se2sion, in the midst of a2l Israel: 
But your eyes have s2en a2l the great acts of the LORD which he did. 
Therefore sha2l ye k2ep a2l the co2mandments which I co2mand you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and po2se2s the land, whither ye go to po2se2s it; 
And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their s2ed, a land that floweth with milk and honey. 
For the land, whither thou goest in to po2se2s it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy s2ed, and wateredst it with thy f2ot, as a garden of herbs: 
But the land, whither ye go to po2se2s it, is a land of hi2ls and va2leys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven: 
A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the begi2ning of the year even unto the end of the year. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, if ye sha2l hearken diligently unto my co2mandments which I co2mand you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with a2l your heart and with a2l your soul, 
That I wi2l give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the la2ter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. 
And I wi2l send gra2s in thy fields for thy ca2tle, that thou mayest eat and be fu2l. 
Take h2ed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; 
And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from o2f the g2od land which the LORD giveth you. 
Therefore sha2l ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets betw2en your eyes. 
And ye sha2l teach them your children, speaking of them when thou si2test in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. 
And thou shalt write them upon the d2or posts of thine house, and upon thy gates: 
That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth. 
For if ye sha2l diligently k2ep a2l these co2mandments which I co2mand you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in a2l his ways, and to cleave unto him; 
Then wi2l the LORD drive out a2l these nations from before you, and ye sha2l po2se2s greater nations and mightier than yourselves. 
Every place whereon the soles of your f2et sha2l tread sha2l be yours: from the wilderne2s and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the u2termost sea sha2l your coast be. 
There sha2l no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God sha2l lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon a2l the land that ye sha2l tread upon, as he hath said unto you. 
Behold, I set before you this day a ble2sing and a curse; 
A ble2sing, if ye obey the co2mandments of the LORD your God, which I co2mand you this day: 
And a curse, if ye wi2l not obey the co2mandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I co2mand you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, when the LORD thy God hath brought th2e in unto the land whither thou goest to po2se2s it, that thou shalt put the ble2sing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal. 
Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Can2anites, which dwe2l in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh? 
For ye sha2l pa2s over Jordan to go in to po2se2s the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye sha2l po2se2s it, and dwe2l therein. 
And ye sha2l observe to do a2l the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day. 
These are the statutes and judgments, which ye sha2l observe to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth th2e to po2se2s it, a2l the days that ye live upon the earth. 
Ye sha2l u2terly destroy a2l the places, wherein the nations which ye sha2l po2se2s served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hi2ls, and under every gr2en tr2e: 
And ye sha2l overthrow their altars, and break their pi2lars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye sha2l hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place. 
Ye sha2l not do so unto the LORD your God. 
But unto the place which the LORD your God sha2l ch2ose out of a2l your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation sha2l ye s2ek, and thither thou shalt come: 
And thither ye sha2l bring your burnt o2ferings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave o2ferings of your hand, and your vows, and your fr2ewi2l o2ferings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks: 
And there ye sha2l eat before the LORD your God, and ye sha2l rejoice in a2l that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy God hath ble2sed th2e. 
Ye sha2l not do after a2l the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes. 
For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God giveth you. 
But when ye go over Jordan, and dwe2l in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from a2l your enemies round about, so that ye dwe2l in safety; 
Then there sha2l be a place which the LORD your God sha2l ch2ose to cause his name to dwe2l there; thither sha2l ye bring a2l that I co2mand you; your burnt o2ferings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave o2fering of your hand, and a2l your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD: 
And ye sha2l rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you. 
Take h2ed to thyself that thou o2fer not thy burnt o2ferings in every place that thou s2est: 
But in the place which the LORD sha2l ch2ose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt o2fer thy burnt o2ferings, and there thou shalt do a2l that I co2mand th2e. 
Notwithstanding thou mayest ki2l and eat flesh in a2l thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, a2cording to the ble2sing of the LORD thy God which he hath given th2e: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart. 
Only ye sha2l not eat the bl2od; ye sha2l pour it upon the earth as water. 
Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy fr2ewi2l o2ferings, or heave o2fering of thine hand: 
But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God sha2l ch2ose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in a2l that thou pu2test thine hands unto. 
Take h2ed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth. 
When the LORD thy God sha2l enlarge thy border, as he hath promised th2e, and thou shalt say, I wi2l eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after. 
If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there be t2o far from th2e, then thou shalt ki2l of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given th2e, as I have co2manded th2e, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after. 
Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean sha2l eat of them alike. 
Only be sure that thou eat not the bl2od: for the bl2od is the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh. 
Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water. 
Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go we2l with th2e, and with thy children after th2e, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD. 
Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the LORD sha2l ch2ose: 
And thou shalt o2fer thy burnt o2ferings, the flesh and the bl2od, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the bl2od of thy sacrifices sha2l be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh. 
Observe and hear a2l these words which I co2mand th2e, that it may go we2l with th2e, and with thy children after th2e for ever, when thou doest that which is g2od and right in the sight of the LORD thy God. 
When the LORD thy God sha2l cut o2f the nations from before th2e, whither thou goest to po2se2s them, and thou su2c2edest them, and dwe2lest in their land; 
Take h2ed to thyself that thou be not snared by fo2lowing them, after that they be destroyed from before th2e; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so wi2l I do likewise. 
Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods. 
What thing soever I co2mand you, observe to do it: thou shalt not a2d thereto, nor diminish from it. 
If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth th2e a sign or a wonder, 
And the sign or the wonder come to pa2s, whereof he spake unto th2e, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; 
Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with a2l your heart and with a2l your soul. 
Ye sha2l walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and k2ep his co2mandments, and obey his voice, and ye sha2l serve him, and cleave unto him. 
And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, sha2l be put to death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and red2emed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust th2e out of the way which the LORD thy God co2manded th2e to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of th2e. 
If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice th2e secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; 
Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto th2e, or far o2f from th2e, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; 
Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither sha2l thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: 
But thou shalt surely ki2l him; thine hand sha2l be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of a2l the people. 
And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust th2e away from the LORD thy God, which brought th2e out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. 
And a2l Israel sha2l hear, and fear, and sha2l do no more any such wickedne2s as this is among you. 
If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the LORD thy God hath given th2e to dwe2l there, saying, 
Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known; 
Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought among you; 
Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it u2terly, and a2l that is therein, and the ca2tle thereof, with the edge of the sword. 
And thou shalt gather a2l the spoil of it into the midst of the str2et thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and a2l the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it sha2l be an heap for ever; it sha2l not be built again. 
And there sha2l cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: that the LORD may turn from the fiercene2s of his anger, and shew th2e mercy, and have compa2sion upon th2e, and multiply th2e, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers; 
When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to k2ep a2l his co2mandments which I co2mand th2e this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God. 
Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye sha2l not cut yourselves, nor make any baldne2s betw2en your eyes for the dead. 
For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORD hath chosen th2e to be a peculiar people unto himself, above a2l the nations that are upon the earth. 
Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing. 
These are the beasts which ye sha2l eat: the ox, the sh2ep, and the goat, 
The hart, and the roebuck, and the fa2low d2er, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois. 
And every beast that parteth the h2of, and cleaveth the cleft into two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye sha2l eat. 
Neverthele2s these ye sha2l not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven h2of; as the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the h2of; therefore they are unclean unto you. 
And the swine, because it divideth the h2of, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye sha2l not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase. 
These ye sha2l eat of a2l that are in the waters: a2l that have fins and scales sha2l ye eat: 
And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is unclean unto you. 
Of a2l clean birds ye sha2l eat. 
But these are they of which ye sha2l not eat: the eagle, and the o2sifrage, and the ospray, 
And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind, 
And every raven after his kind, 
And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, 
The li2tle owl, and the great owl, and the swan, 
And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant, 
And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat. 
And every cr2eping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: they sha2l not be eaten. 
But of a2l clean fowls ye may eat. 
Ye sha2l not eat of anything that dieth of itself: thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest se2l it unto an alien: for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not s2ethe a kid in his mother's milk. 
Thou shalt truly tithe a2l the increase of thy s2ed, that the field bringeth forth year by year. 
And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he sha2l ch2ose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always. 
And if the way be t2o long for th2e, so that thou art not able to ca2ry it; or if the place be t2o far from th2e, which the LORD thy God sha2l ch2ose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath ble2sed th2e: 
Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God sha2l ch2ose: 
And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sh2ep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household, 
And the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with th2e. 
At the end of thr2e years thou shalt bring forth a2l the tithe of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates: 
And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with th2e,) and the stranger, and the fatherle2s, and the widow, which are within thy gates, sha2l come, and sha2l eat and be satisfied; that the LORD thy God may ble2s th2e in a2l the work of thine hand which thou doest. 
At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release. 
And this is the ma2ner of the release: Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour sha2l release it; he sha2l not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is ca2led the LORD's release. 
Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand sha2l release; 
Save when there sha2l be no p2or among you; for the LORD sha2l greatly ble2s th2e in the land which the LORD thy God giveth th2e for an inheritance to po2se2s it: 
Only if thou carefu2ly hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do a2l these co2mandments which I co2mand th2e this day. 
For the LORD thy God ble2seth th2e, as he promised th2e: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not bo2row; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they sha2l not reign over th2e. 
If there be among you a p2or man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth th2e, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy p2or brother: 
But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him su2ficient for his n2ed, in that which he wanteth. 
Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy p2or brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against th2e, and it be sin unto th2e. 
Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart sha2l not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God sha2l ble2s th2e in a2l thy works, and in a2l that thou pu2test thine hand unto. 
For the p2or sha2l never cease out of the land: therefore I co2mand th2e, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy p2or, and to thy n2edy, in thy land. 
And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto th2e, and serve th2e six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go fr2e from th2e. 
And when thou sendest him out fr2e from th2e, thou shalt not let him go away empty: 
Thou shalt furnish him libera2ly out of thy flock, and out of thy fl2or, and out of thy winepre2s: of that wherewith the LORD thy God hath ble2sed th2e thou shalt give unto him. 
And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God red2emed th2e: therefore I co2mand th2e this thing to day. 
And it sha2l be, if he say unto th2e, I wi2l not go away from th2e; because he loveth th2e and thine house, because he is we2l with th2e; 
Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his ear unto the d2or, and he sha2l be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise. 
It sha2l not s2em hard unto th2e, when thou sendest him away fr2e from th2e; for he hath b2en worth a double hired servant to th2e, in serving th2e six years: and the LORD thy God sha2l ble2s th2e in a2l that thou doest. 
A2l the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bu2lock, nor shear the firstling of thy sh2ep. 
Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD sha2l ch2ose, thou and thy household. 
And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind, or have any i2l blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God. 
Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean person sha2l eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart. 
Only thou shalt not eat the bl2od thereof; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water. 
Observe the month of Abib, and k2ep the pa2sover unto the LORD thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought th2e forth out of Egypt by night. 
Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the pa2sover unto the LORD thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD sha2l ch2ose to place his name there. 
Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of a2fliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt a2l the days of thy life. 
And there sha2l be no leavened bread s2en with th2e in a2l thy coast seven days; neither sha2l there any thing of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain a2l night until the morning. 
Thou mayest not sacrifice the pa2sover within any of thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth th2e: 
But at the place which the LORD thy God sha2l ch2ose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the pa2sover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt. 
And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God sha2l ch2ose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents. 
Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day sha2l be a solemn a2sembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work therein. 
Seven w2eks shalt thou number unto th2e: begin to number the seven w2eks from such time as thou begi2nest to put the sickle to the corn. 
And thou shalt k2ep the feast of w2eks unto the LORD thy God with a tribute of a fr2ewi2l o2fering of thine hand, which thou shalt give unto the LORD thy God, a2cording as the LORD thy God hath ble2sed th2e: 
And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherle2s, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there. 
And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes. 
Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine: 
And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherle2s, and the widow, that are within thy gates. 
Seven days shalt thou k2ep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD sha2l ch2ose: because the LORD thy God sha2l ble2s th2e in a2l thine increase, and in a2l the works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice. 
Thr2e times in a year sha2l a2l thy males a2pear before the LORD thy God in the place which he sha2l ch2ose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of w2eks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they sha2l not a2pear before the LORD empty: 
Every man sha2l give as he is able, a2cording to the ble2sing of the LORD thy God which he hath given th2e. 
Judges and o2ficers shalt thou make th2e in a2l thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth th2e, throughout thy tribes: and they sha2l judge the people with just judgment. 
Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous. 
That which is altogether just shalt thou fo2low, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth th2e. 
Thou shalt not plant th2e a grove of any tr2es near unto the altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make th2e. 
Neither shalt thou set th2e up any image; which the LORD thy God hateth. 
Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God any bu2lock, or sh2ep, wherein is blemish, or any evilfavouredne2s: for that is an abomination unto the LORD thy God. 
If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth th2e, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedne2s in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgre2sing his covenant, 
And hath gone and served other gods, and worshi2ped them, either the sun, or m2on, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not co2manded; 
And it be told th2e, and thou hast heard of it, and enquired diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought in Israel: 
Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have co2mi2ted that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, ti2l they die. 
At the mouth of two witne2ses, or thr2e witne2ses, sha2l he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witne2s he sha2l not be put to death. 
The hands of the witne2ses sha2l be first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of a2l the people. So thou shalt put the evil away from among you. 
If there arise a ma2ter t2o hard for th2e in judgment, betw2en bl2od and bl2od, betw2en plea and plea, and betw2en stroke and stroke, being ma2ters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and get th2e up into the place which the LORD thy God sha2l ch2ose; 
And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that sha2l be in those days, and enquire; and they sha2l shew th2e the sentence of judgment: 
And thou shalt do a2cording to the sentence, which they of that place which the LORD sha2l ch2ose sha2l shew th2e; and thou shalt observe to do a2cording to a2l that they inform th2e: 
A2cording to the sentence of the law which they sha2l teach th2e, and a2cording to the judgment which they sha2l te2l th2e, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they sha2l shew th2e, to the right hand, nor to the left. 
And the man that wi2l do presumptuously, and wi2l not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God, or unto the judge, even that man sha2l die: and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel. 
And a2l the people sha2l hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously. 
When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth th2e, and shalt po2se2s it, and shalt dwe2l therein, and shalt say, I wi2l set a king over me, like as a2l the nations that are about me; 
Thou shalt in any wise set him king over th2e, whom the LORD thy God sha2l ch2ose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over th2e: thou mayest not set a stranger over th2e, which is not thy brother. 
But he sha2l not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye sha2l henceforth return no more that way. 
Neither sha2l he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither sha2l he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold. 
And it sha2l be, when he si2teth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he sha2l write him a copy of this law in a b2ok out of that which is before the priests the Levites: 
And it sha2l be with him, and he sha2l read therein a2l the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to k2ep a2l the words of this law and these statutes, to do them: 
That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the co2mandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel. 
The priests the Levites, and a2l the tribe of Levi, sha2l have no part nor inheritance with Israel: they sha2l eat the o2ferings of the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance. 
Therefore sha2l they have no inheritance among their brethren: the LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them. 
And this sha2l be the priest's due from the people, from them that o2fer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sh2ep; and they sha2l give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two ch2eks, and the maw. 
The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fl2ece of thy sh2ep, shalt thou give him. 
For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of a2l thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever. 
And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of a2l Israel, where he sojourned, and come with a2l the desire of his mind unto the place which the LORD sha2l ch2ose; 
Then he sha2l minister in the name of the LORD his God, as a2l his brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the LORD. 
They sha2l have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony. 
When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth th2e, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations. 
There sha2l not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pa2s through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch. 
Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. 
For a2l that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD: and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before th2e. 
Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God. 
For these nations, which thou shalt po2se2s, hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for th2e, the LORD thy God hath not su2fered th2e so to do. 
The LORD thy God wi2l raise up unto th2e a Prophet from the midst of th2e, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye sha2l hearken; 
A2cording to a2l that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the a2sembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me s2e this great fire any more, that I die not. 
And the LORD said unto me, They have we2l spoken that which they have spoken. 
I wi2l raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto th2e, and wi2l put my words in his mouth; and he sha2l speak unto them a2l that I sha2l co2mand him. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that whosoever wi2l not hearken unto my words which he sha2l speak in my name, I wi2l require it of him. 
But the prophet, which sha2l presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not co2manded him to speak, or that sha2l speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet sha2l die. 
And if thou say in thine heart, How sha2l we know the word which the LORD hath not spoken? 
When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing fo2low not, nor come to pa2s, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him. 
When the LORD thy God hath cut o2f the nations, whose land the LORD thy God giveth th2e, and thou su2c2edest them, and dwe2lest in their cities, and in their houses; 
Thou shalt separate thr2e cities for th2e in the midst of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth th2e to po2se2s it. 
Thou shalt prepare th2e a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth th2e to inherit, into thr2e parts, that every slayer may fl2e thither. 
And this is the case of the slayer, which sha2l fl2e thither, that he may live: Whoso ki2leth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past; 
As when a man goeth into the w2od with his neighbour to hew w2od, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tr2e, and the head sli2peth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he sha2l fl2e unto one of those cities, and live: 
Lest the avenger of the bl2od pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past. 
Wherefore I co2mand th2e, saying, Thou shalt separate thr2e cities for th2e. 
And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give th2e a2l the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers; 
If thou shalt k2ep a2l these co2mandments to do them, which I co2mand th2e this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou a2d thr2e cities more for th2e, beside these thr2e: 
That i2nocent bl2od be not shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth th2e for an inheritance, and so bl2od be upon th2e. 
But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him morta2ly that he die, and fl2eth into one of these cities: 
Then the elders of his city sha2l send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of bl2od, that he may die. 
Thine eye sha2l not pity him, but thou shalt put away the guilt of i2nocent bl2od from Israel, that it may go we2l with th2e. 
Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth th2e to po2se2s it. 
One witne2s sha2l not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he si2neth: at the mouth of two witne2ses, or at the mouth of thr2e witne2ses, sha2l the ma2ter be established. 
If a false witne2s rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong; 
Then both the men, betw2en whom the controversy is, sha2l stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which sha2l be in those days; 
And the judges sha2l make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witne2s be a false witne2s, and hath testified falsely against his brother; 
Then sha2l ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you. 
And those which remain sha2l hear, and fear, and sha2l henceforth co2mit no more any such evil among you. 
And thine eye sha2l not pity; but life sha2l go for life, eye for eye, t2oth for t2oth, hand for hand, f2ot for f2ot. 
When thou goest out to ba2tle against thine enemies, and s2est horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the LORD thy God is with th2e, which brought th2e up out of the land of Egypt. 
And it sha2l be, when ye are come nigh unto the ba2tle, that the priest sha2l a2proach and speak unto the people, 
And sha2l say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye a2proach this day unto ba2tle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye te2rified because of them; 
For the LORD your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you. 
And the o2ficers sha2l speak unto the people, saying, What man is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the ba2tle, and another man dedicate it. 
And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yet eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die in the ba2tle, and another man eat of it. 
And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the ba2tle, and another man take her. 
And the o2ficers sha2l speak further unto the people, and they sha2l say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's heart faint as we2l as his heart. 
And it sha2l be, when the o2ficers have made an end of speaking unto the people that they sha2l make captains of the armies to lead the people. 
When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it. 
And it sha2l be, if it make th2e answer of peace, and open unto th2e, then it sha2l be, that a2l the people that is found therein sha2l be tributaries unto th2e, and they sha2l serve th2e. 
And if it wi2l make no peace with th2e, but wi2l make war against th2e, then thou shalt besiege it: 
And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword: 
But the women, and the li2tle ones, and the ca2tle, and a2l that is in the city, even a2l the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given th2e. 
Thus shalt thou do unto a2l the cities which are very far o2f from th2e, which are not of the cities of these nations. 
But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth give th2e for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth: 
But thou shalt u2terly destroy them; namely, the Hi2tites, and the Amorites, the Can2anites, and the Peri2zites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath co2manded th2e: 
That they teach you not to do after a2l their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the LORD your God. 
When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the tr2es thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tr2e of the field is man's life) to employ them in the siege: 
Only the tr2es which thou knowest that they be not tr2es for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with th2e, until it be subdued. 
If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth th2e to po2se2s it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath slain him: 
Then thy elders and thy judges sha2l come forth, and they sha2l measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain: 
And it sha2l be, that the city which is next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city sha2l take an heifer, which hath not b2en wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke; 
And the elders of that city sha2l bring down the heifer unto a rough va2ley, which is neither eared nor sown, and sha2l strike o2f the heifer's neck there in the va2ley: 
And the priests the sons of Levi sha2l come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to ble2s in the name of the LORD; and by their word sha2l every controversy and every stroke be tried: 
And a2l the elders of that city, that are next unto the slain man, sha2l wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the va2ley: 
And they sha2l answer and say, Our hands have not shed this bl2od, neither have our eyes s2en it. 
Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast red2emed, and lay not i2nocent bl2od unto thy people of Israel's charge. And the bl2od sha2l be forgiven them. 
So shalt thou put away the guilt of i2nocent bl2od from among you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD. 
When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive, 
And s2est among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife; 
Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house, and she sha2l shave her head, and pare her nails; 
And she sha2l put the raiment of her captivity from o2f her, and sha2l remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a fu2l month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she sha2l be thy wife. 
And it sha2l be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she wi2l; but thou shalt not se2l her at a2l for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her. 
If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated: 
Then it sha2l be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which is ind2ed the firstborn: 
But he sha2l acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of a2l that he hath: for he is the begi2ning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his. 
If a man have a stu2born and rebe2lious son, which wi2l not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, wi2l not hearken unto them: 
Then sha2l his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; 
And they sha2l say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stu2born and rebe2lious, he wi2l not obey our voice; he is a glu2ton, and a drunkard. 
And a2l the men of his city sha2l stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and a2l Israel sha2l hear, and fear. 
And if a man have co2mi2ted a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tr2e: 
His body sha2l not remain a2l night upon the tr2e, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is a2cursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth th2e for an inheritance. 
Thou shalt not s2e thy brother's ox or his sh2ep go astray, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother. 
And if thy brother be not nigh unto th2e, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it sha2l be with th2e until thy brother s2ek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again. 
In like ma2ner shalt thou do with his a2s; and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with a2l lost thing of thy brother's, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself. 
Thou shalt not s2e thy brother's a2s or his ox fa2l down by the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again. 
The woman sha2l not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither sha2l a man put on a woman's garment: for a2l that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God. 
If a bird's nest chance to be before th2e in the way in any tr2e, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or e2gs, and the dam si2ting upon the young, or upon the e2gs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young: 
But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to th2e; that it may be we2l with th2e, and that thou mayest prolong thy days. 
When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a ba2tlement for thy r2of, that thou bring not bl2od upon thine house, if any man fa2l from thence. 
Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers s2eds: lest the fruit of thy s2ed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be defiled. 
Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an a2s together. 
Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of w2o2len and linen together. 
Thou shalt make th2e fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself. 
If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her, 
And give o2casions of sp2ech against her, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say, I t2ok this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid: 
Then sha2l the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate: 
And the damsel's father sha2l say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her; 
And, lo, he hath given o2casions of sp2ech against her, saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they sha2l spread the cloth before the elders of the city. 
And the elders of that city sha2l take that man and chastise him; 
And they sha2l amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she sha2l be his wife; he may not put her away a2l his days. 
But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel: 
Then they sha2l bring out the damsel to the d2or of her father's house, and the men of her city sha2l stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought fo2ly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you. 
If a man be found lying with a woman ma2ried to an husband, then they sha2l both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel. 
If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; 
Then ye sha2l bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye sha2l stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you. 
But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her sha2l die. 
But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this ma2ter: 
For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her. 
If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; 
Then the man that lay with her sha2l give unto the damsel's father fifty shekels of silver, and she sha2l be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away a2l his days. 
A man sha2l not take his father's wife, nor discover his father's skirt. 
He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut o2f, sha2l not enter into the congregation of the LORD. 
A bastard sha2l not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to his tenth generation sha2l he not enter into the congregation of the LORD. 
An A2monite or Moabite sha2l not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to their tenth generation sha2l they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever: 
Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against th2e Bal2am the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse th2e. 
Neverthele2s the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Bal2am; but the LORD thy God turned the curse into a ble2sing unto th2e, because the LORD thy God loved th2e. 
Thou shalt not s2ek their peace nor their prosperity a2l thy days for ever. 
Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land. 
The children that are bego2ten of them sha2l enter into the congregation of the LORD in their third generation. 
When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then k2ep th2e from every wicked thing. 
If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of unclea2ne2s that chanceth him by night, then sha2l he go abroad out of the camp, he sha2l not come within the camp: 
But it sha2l be, when evening cometh on, he sha2l wash himself with water: and when the sun is down, he sha2l come into the camp again. 
Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad: 
And thou shalt have a pa2dle upon thy weapon; and it sha2l be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from th2e: 
For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver th2e, and to give up thine enemies before th2e; therefore sha2l thy camp be holy: that he s2e no unclean thing in th2e, and turn away from th2e. 
Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto th2e: 
He sha2l dwe2l with th2e, even among you, in that place which he sha2l ch2ose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best: thou shalt not o2pre2s him. 
There sha2l be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel. 
Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow: for even both these are abomination unto the LORD thy God. 
Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury: 
Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the LORD thy God may ble2s th2e in a2l that thou se2test thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to po2se2s it. 
When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God wi2l surely require it of th2e; and it would be sin in th2e. 
But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it sha2l be no sin in th2e. 
That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt k2ep and perform; even a fr2ewi2l o2fering, a2cording as thou hast vowed unto the LORD thy God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth. 
When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard, then thou mayest eat grapes thy fi2l at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put any in thy ve2sel. 
When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour, then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour's standing corn. 
When a man hath taken a wife, and ma2ried her, and it come to pa2s that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some unclea2ne2s in her: then let him write her a bi2l of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house. 
And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's wife. 
And if the la2ter husband hate her, and write her a bi2l of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the la2ter husband die, which t2ok her to be his wife; 
Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth th2e for an inheritance. 
When a man hath taken a new wife, he sha2l not go out to war, neither sha2l he be charged with any busine2s: but he sha2l be fr2e at home one year, and sha2l ch2er up his wife which he hath taken. 
No man sha2l take the nether or the u2per mi2lstone to pledge: for he taketh a man's life to pledge. 
If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or se2leth him; then that thief sha2l die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you. 
Take h2ed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do a2cording to a2l that the priests the Levites sha2l teach you: as I co2manded them, so ye sha2l observe to do. 
Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that ye were come forth out of Egypt. 
When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge. 
Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend sha2l bring out the pledge abroad unto th2e. 
And if the man be p2or, thou shalt not sl2ep with his pledge: 
In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sl2ep in his own raiment, and ble2s th2e: and it sha2l be righteousne2s unto th2e before the LORD thy God. 
Thou shalt not o2pre2s an hired servant that is p2or and n2edy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates: 
At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither sha2l the sun go down upon it; for he is p2or, and se2teth his heart upon it: lest he cry against th2e unto the LORD, and it be sin unto th2e. 
The fathers sha2l not be put to death for the children, neither sha2l the children be put to death for the fathers: every man sha2l be put to death for his own sin. 
Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the fatherle2s; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge: 
But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God red2emed th2e thence: therefore I co2mand th2e to do this thing. 
When thou cu2test down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it sha2l be for the stranger, for the fatherle2s, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may ble2s th2e in a2l the work of thine hands. 
When thou beatest thine olive tr2e, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it sha2l be for the stranger, for the fatherle2s, and for the widow. 
When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it afterward: it sha2l be for the stranger, for the fatherle2s, and for the widow. 
And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I co2mand th2e to do this thing. 
If there be a controversy betw2en men, and they come unto judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they sha2l justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked. 
And it sha2l be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, that the judge sha2l cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face, a2cording to his fault, by a certain number. 
Forty stripes he may give him, and not exc2ed: lest, if he should exc2ed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should s2em vile unto th2e. 
Thou shalt not mu2zle the ox when he treadeth out the corn. 
If brethren dwe2l together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead sha2l not ma2ry without unto a stranger: her husband's brother sha2l go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her. 
And it sha2l be, that the firstborn which she beareth sha2l su2c2ed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his name be not put out of Israel. 
And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he wi2l not perform the duty of my husband's brother. 
Then the elders of his city sha2l ca2l him, and speak unto him: and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her; 
Then sha2l his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and l2ose his shoe from o2f his f2ot, and spit in his face, and sha2l answer and say, So sha2l it be done unto that man that wi2l not build up his brother's house. 
And his name sha2l be ca2led in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe l2osed. 
When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him, and pu2teth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets: 
Then thou shalt cut o2f her hand, thine eye sha2l not pity her. 
Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a sma2l. 
Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a sma2l. 
But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the LORD thy God giveth th2e. 
For a2l that do such things, and a2l that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto the LORD thy God. 
Remember what Amalek did unto th2e by the way, when ye were come forth out of Egypt; 
How he met th2e by the way, and smote the hindmost of th2e, even a2l that were f2eble behind th2e, when thou wast faint and weary; and he feared not God. 
Therefore it sha2l be, when the LORD thy God hath given th2e rest from a2l thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth th2e for an inheritance to po2se2s it, that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget it. 
And it sha2l be, when thou art come in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth th2e for an inheritance, and po2se2sest it, and dwe2lest therein; 
That thou shalt take of the first of a2l the fruit of the earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD thy God giveth th2e, and shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God sha2l ch2ose to place his name there. 
And thou shalt go unto the priest that sha2l be in those days, and say unto him, I profe2s this day unto the LORD thy God, that I am come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our fathers for to give us. 
And the priest sha2l take the basket out of thine hand, and set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God. 
And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous: 
And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and a2flicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage: 
And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD heard our voice, and l2oked on our a2fliction, and our labour, and our o2pre2sion: 
And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great te2riblene2s, and with signs, and with wonders: 
And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey. 
And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land, which thou, O LORD, hast given me. And thou shalt set it before the LORD thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God: 
And thou shalt rejoice in every g2od thing which the LORD thy God hath given unto th2e, and unto thine house, thou, and the Levite, and the stranger that is among you. 
When thou hast made an end of tithing a2l the tithes of thine increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and hast given it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherle2s, and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be fi2led; 
Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought away the ha2lowed things out of mine house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherle2s, and to the widow, a2cording to a2l thy co2mandments which thou hast co2manded me: I have not transgre2sed thy co2mandments, neither have I forgo2ten them. 
I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof for the dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, and have done a2cording to a2l that thou hast co2manded me. 
L2ok down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and ble2s thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey. 
This day the LORD thy God hath co2manded th2e to do these statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore k2ep and do them with a2l thine heart, and with a2l thy soul. 
Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to k2ep his statutes, and his co2mandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice: 
And the LORD hath avouched th2e this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised th2e, and that thou shouldest k2ep a2l his co2mandments; 
And to make th2e high above a2l nations which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the LORD thy God, as he hath spoken. 
And Moses with the elders of Israel co2manded the people, saying, K2ep a2l the co2mandments which I co2mand you this day. 
And it sha2l be on the day when ye sha2l pa2s over Jordan unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth th2e, that thou shalt set th2e up great stones, and plaister them with plaister: 
And thou shalt write upon them a2l the words of this law, when thou art pa2sed over, that thou mayest go in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth th2e, a land that floweth with milk and honey; as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised th2e. 
Therefore it sha2l be when ye be gone over Jordan, that ye sha2l set up these stones, which I co2mand you this day, in mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaister them with plaister. 
And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, an altar of stones: thou shalt not lift up any iron t2ol upon them. 
Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones: and thou shalt o2fer burnt o2ferings thereon unto the LORD thy God: 
And thou shalt o2fer peace o2ferings, and shalt eat there, and rejoice before the LORD thy God. 
And thou shalt write upon the stones a2l the words of this law very plainly. 
And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto a2l Israel, saying, Take h2ed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become the people of the LORD thy God. 
Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God, and do his co2mandments and his statutes, which I co2mand th2e this day. 
And Moses charged the people the same day, saying, 
These sha2l stand upon mount Gerizim to ble2s the people, when ye are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and I2sachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin: 
And these sha2l stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali. 
And the Levites sha2l speak, and say unto a2l the men of Israel with a loud voice, 
Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image, an abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and pu2teth it in a secret place. And a2l the people sha2l answer and say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that se2teth light by his father or his mother. And a2l the people sha2l say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour's landmark. And a2l the people sha2l say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way. And a2l the people sha2l say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger, fatherle2s, and widow. And a2l the people sha2l say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that lieth with his father's wife; because he uncovereth his father's skirt. And a2l the people sha2l say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that lieth with any ma2ner of beast. And a2l the people sha2l say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And a2l the people sha2l say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that lieth with his mother in law. And a2l the people sha2l say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly. And a2l the people sha2l say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an i2nocent person. And a2l the people sha2l say, Amen. 
Cursed be he that confirmeth not a2l the words of this law to do them. And a2l the people sha2l say, Amen. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do a2l his co2mandments which I co2mand th2e this day, that the LORD thy God wi2l set th2e on high above a2l nations of the earth: 
And a2l these ble2sings sha2l come on th2e, and overtake th2e, if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God. 
Ble2sed shalt thou be in the city, and ble2sed shalt thou be in the field. 
Ble2sed sha2l be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy ca2tle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sh2ep. 
Ble2sed sha2l be thy basket and thy store. 
Ble2sed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and ble2sed shalt thou be when thou goest out. 
The LORD sha2l cause thine enemies that rise up against th2e to be smi2ten before thy face: they sha2l come out against th2e one way, and fl2e before th2e seven ways. 
The LORD sha2l co2mand the ble2sing upon th2e in thy storehouses, and in a2l that thou se2test thine hand unto; and he sha2l ble2s th2e in the land which the LORD thy God giveth th2e. 
The LORD sha2l establish th2e an holy people unto himself, as he hath sworn unto th2e, if thou shalt k2ep the co2mandments of the LORD thy God, and walk in his ways. 
And a2l people of the earth sha2l s2e that thou art ca2led by the name of the LORD; and they sha2l be afraid of th2e. 
And the LORD sha2l make th2e plenteous in g2ods, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy ca2tle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give th2e. 
The LORD sha2l open unto th2e his g2od treasure, the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to ble2s a2l the work of thine hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not bo2row. 
And the LORD sha2l make th2e the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou hearken unto the co2mandments of the LORD thy God, which I co2mand th2e this day, to observe and to do them: 
And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I co2mand th2e this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them. 
But it sha2l come to pa2s, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do a2l his co2mandments and his statutes which I co2mand th2e this day; that a2l these curses sha2l come upon th2e, and overtake th2e: 
Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field. 
Cursed sha2l be thy basket and thy store. 
Cursed sha2l be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sh2ep. 
Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out. 
The LORD sha2l send upon th2e cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in a2l that thou se2test thine hand unto for to do, until thou be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedne2s of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me. 
The LORD sha2l make the pestilence cleave unto th2e, until he have consumed th2e from o2f the land, whither thou goest to po2se2s it. 
The LORD sha2l smite th2e with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an infla2mation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they sha2l pursue th2e until thou perish. 
And thy heaven that is over thy head sha2l be bra2s, and the earth that is under th2e sha2l be iron. 
The LORD sha2l make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from heaven sha2l it come down upon th2e, until thou be destroyed. 
The LORD sha2l cause th2e to be smi2ten before thine enemies: thou shalt go out one way against them, and fl2e seven ways before them: and shalt be removed into a2l the kingdoms of the earth. 
And thy carcase sha2l be meat unto a2l fowls of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth, and no man sha2l fray them away. 
The LORD wi2l smite th2e with the botch of Egypt, and with the emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be healed. 
The LORD sha2l smite th2e with madne2s, and blindne2s, and astonishment of heart: 
And thou shalt grope at n2onday, as the blind gropeth in darkne2s, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only o2pre2sed and spoiled evermore, and no man sha2l save th2e. 
Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man sha2l lie with her: thou shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwe2l therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes thereof. 
Thine ox sha2l be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof: thine a2s sha2l be violently taken away from before thy face, and sha2l not be restored to th2e: thy sh2ep sha2l be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to rescue them. 
Thy sons and thy daughters sha2l be given unto another people, and thine eyes sha2l l2ok, and fail with longing for them a2l the day long; and there sha2l be no might in thine hand. 
The fruit of thy land, and a2l thy labours, sha2l a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only o2pre2sed and crushed alway: 
So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt s2e. 
The LORD sha2l smite th2e in the kn2es, and in the legs, with a sore botch that ca2not be healed, from the sole of thy f2ot unto the top of thy head. 
The LORD sha2l bring th2e, and thy king which thou shalt set over th2e, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known; and there shalt thou serve other gods, w2od and stone. 
And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among a2l nations whither the LORD sha2l lead th2e. 
Thou shalt ca2ry much s2ed out into the field, and shalt gather but li2tle in; for the locust sha2l consume it. 
Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dre2s them, but shalt neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms sha2l eat them. 
Thou shalt have olive tr2es throughout a2l thy coasts, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive sha2l cast his fruit. 
Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them; for they sha2l go into captivity. 
A2l thy tr2es and fruit of thy land sha2l the locust consume. 
The stranger that is within th2e sha2l get up above th2e very high; and thou shalt come down very low. 
He sha2l lend to th2e, and thou shalt not lend to him: he sha2l be the head, and thou shalt be the tail. 
Moreover a2l these curses sha2l come upon th2e, and sha2l pursue th2e, and overtake th2e, ti2l thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to k2ep his co2mandments and his statutes which he co2manded th2e: 
And they sha2l be upon th2e for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy s2ed for ever. 
Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulne2s, and with gladne2s of heart, for the abundance of a2l things; 
Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD sha2l send against th2e, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedne2s, and in want of a2l things: and he sha2l put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed th2e. 
The LORD sha2l bring a nation against th2e from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand; 
A nation of fierce countenance, which sha2l not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young: 
And he sha2l eat the fruit of thy ca2tle, and the fruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed: which also sha2l not leave th2e either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sh2ep, until he have destroyed th2e. 
And he sha2l besiege th2e in a2l thy gates, until thy high and fenced wa2ls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout a2l thy land: and he sha2l besiege th2e in a2l thy gates throughout a2l thy land, which the LORD thy God hath given th2e. 
And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath given th2e, in the siege, and in the straitne2s, wherewith thine enemies sha2l distre2s th2e: 
So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye sha2l be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he sha2l leave: 
So that he wi2l not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he sha2l eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitne2s, wherewith thine enemies sha2l distre2s th2e in a2l thy gates. 
The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her f2ot upon the ground for delicatene2s and tenderne2s, her eye sha2l be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter, 
And toward her young one that cometh out from betw2en her f2et, and toward her children which she sha2l bear: for she sha2l eat them for want of a2l things secretly in the siege and straitne2s, wherewith thine enemy sha2l distre2s th2e in thy gates. 
If thou wilt not observe to do a2l the words of this law that are wri2ten in this b2ok, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD; 
Then the LORD wi2l make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy s2ed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sickne2ses, and of long continuance. 
Moreover he wi2l bring upon th2e a2l the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they sha2l cleave unto th2e. 
Also every sickne2s, and every plague, which is not wri2ten in the b2ok of this law, them wi2l the LORD bring upon th2e, until thou be destroyed. 
And ye sha2l be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you g2od, and to multiply you; so the LORD wi2l rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye sha2l be plucked from o2f the land whither thou goest to po2se2s it. 
And the LORD sha2l sca2ter th2e among a2l people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even w2od and stone. 
And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither sha2l the sole of thy f2ot have rest: but the LORD sha2l give th2e there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and so2row of mind: 
And thy life sha2l hang in doubt before th2e; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none a2surance of thy life: 
In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt s2e. 
And the LORD sha2l bring th2e into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto th2e, Thou shalt s2e it no more again: and there ye sha2l be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man sha2l buy you. 
These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD co2manded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb. 
And Moses ca2led unto a2l Israel, and said unto them, Ye have s2en a2l that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto a2l his servants, and unto a2l his land; 
The great temptations which thine eyes have s2en, the signs, and those great miracles: 
Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to s2e, and ears to hear, unto this day. 
And I have led you forty years in the wilderne2s: your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy f2ot. 
Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink: that ye might know that I am the LORD your God. 
And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto ba2tle, and we smote them: 
And we t2ok their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Mana2seh. 
K2ep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in a2l that ye do. 
Ye stand this day a2l of you before the LORD your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your o2ficers, with a2l the men of Israel, 
Your li2tle ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy camp, from the hewer of thy w2od unto the drawer of thy water: 
That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God, and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with th2e this day: 
That he may establish th2e to day for a people unto himself, and that he may be unto th2e a God, as he hath said unto th2e, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Is2ac, and to Jacob. 
Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath; 
But with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day: 
(For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which ye pa2sed by; 
And ye have s2en their abominations, and their idols, w2od and stone, silver and gold, which were among them:) 
Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a r2ot that beareth ga2l and wormw2od; 
And it come to pa2s, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he ble2s himself in his heart, saying, I sha2l have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to a2d drunke2ne2s to thirst: 
The LORD wi2l not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy sha2l smoke against that man, and a2l the curses that are wri2ten in this b2ok sha2l lie upon him, and the LORD sha2l blot out his name from under heaven. 
And the LORD sha2l separate him unto evil out of a2l the tribes of Israel, a2cording to a2l the curses of the covenant that are wri2ten in this b2ok of the law: 
So that the generation to come of your children that sha2l rise up after you, and the stranger that sha2l come from a far land, sha2l say, when they s2e the plagues of that land, and the sickne2ses which the LORD hath laid upon it; 
And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any gra2s groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomo2rah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath: 
Even a2l nations sha2l say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger? 
Then men sha2l say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt: 
For they went and served other gods, and worshi2ped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them: 
And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it a2l the curses that are wri2ten in this b2ok: 
And the LORD r2oted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day. 
The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do a2l the words of this law. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, when a2l these things are come upon th2e, the ble2sing and the curse, which I have set before th2e, and thou shalt ca2l them to mind among a2l the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath driven th2e, 
And shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his voice a2cording to a2l that I co2mand th2e this day, thou and thy children, with a2l thine heart, and with a2l thy soul; 
That then the LORD thy God wi2l turn thy captivity, and have compa2sion upon th2e, and wi2l return and gather th2e from a2l the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath sca2tered th2e. 
If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven, from thence wi2l the LORD thy God gather th2e, and from thence wi2l he fetch th2e: 
And the LORD thy God wi2l bring th2e into the land which thy fathers po2se2sed, and thou shalt po2se2s it; and he wi2l do th2e g2od, and multiply th2e above thy fathers. 
And the LORD thy God wi2l circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy s2ed, to love the LORD thy God with a2l thine heart, and with a2l thy soul, that thou mayest live. 
And the LORD thy God wi2l put a2l these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate th2e, which persecuted th2e. 
And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do a2l his co2mandments which I co2mand th2e this day. 
And the LORD thy God wi2l make th2e plenteous in every work of thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy ca2tle, and in the fruit of thy land, for g2od: for the LORD wi2l again rejoice over th2e for g2od, as he rejoiced over thy fathers: 
If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to k2ep his co2mandments and his statutes which are wri2ten in this b2ok of the law, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with a2l thine heart, and with a2l thy soul. 
For this co2mandment which I co2mand th2e this day, it is not hi2den from th2e, neither is it far o2f. 
It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who sha2l go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? 
Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who sha2l go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? 
But the word is very nigh unto th2e, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it. 
S2e, I have set before th2e this day life and g2od, and death and evil; 
In that I co2mand th2e this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to k2ep his co2mandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the LORD thy God sha2l ble2s th2e in the land whither thou goest to po2se2s it. 
But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them; 
I denounce unto you this day, that ye sha2l surely perish, and that ye sha2l not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou pa2sest over Jordan to go to po2se2s it. 
I ca2l heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, ble2sing and cursing: therefore ch2ose life, that both thou and thy s2ed may live: 
That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwe2l in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Is2ac, and to Jacob, to give them. 
And Moses went and spake these words unto a2l Israel. 
And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan. 
The LORD thy God, he wi2l go over before th2e, and he wi2l destroy these nations from before th2e, and thou shalt po2se2s them: and Joshua, he sha2l go over before th2e, as the LORD hath said. 
And the LORD sha2l do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed. 
And the LORD sha2l give them up before your face, that ye may do unto them a2cording unto a2l the co2mandments which I have co2manded you. 
Be strong and of a g2od courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with th2e; he wi2l not fail th2e, nor forsake th2e. 
And Moses ca2led unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of a2l Israel, Be strong and of a g2od courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it. 
And the LORD, he it is that doth go before th2e; he wi2l be with th2e, he wi2l not fail th2e, neither forsake th2e: fear not, neither be dismayed. 
And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto a2l the elders of Israel. 
And Moses co2manded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles, 
When a2l Israel is come to a2pear before the LORD thy God in the place which he sha2l ch2ose, thou shalt read this law before a2l Israel in their hearing. 
Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do a2l the words of this law: 
And that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to po2se2s it. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days a2proach that thou must die: ca2l Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation. 
And the LORD a2peared in the tabernacle in a pi2lar of a cloud: and the pi2lar of the cloud st2od over the d2or of the tabernacle. 
And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sl2ep with thy fathers; and this people wi2l rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and wi2l forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them. 
Then my anger sha2l be kindled against them in that day, and I wi2l forsake them, and I wi2l hide my face from them, and they sha2l be devoured, and many evils and troubles sha2l befa2l them; so that they wi2l say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God is not among us? 
And I wi2l surely hide my face in that day for a2l the evils which they sha2l have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods. 
Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witne2s for me against the children of Israel. 
For when I sha2l have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they sha2l have eaten and fi2led themselves, and waxen fat; then wi2l they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, when many evils and troubles are befa2len them, that this song sha2l testify against them as a witne2s; for it sha2l not be forgo2ten out of the mouths of their s2ed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware. 
Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel. 
And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a g2od courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I wi2l be with th2e. 
And it came to pa2s, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a b2ok, until they were finished, 
That Moses co2manded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying, 
Take this b2ok of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witne2s against th2e. 
For I know thy rebe2lion, and thy sti2f neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have b2en rebe2lious against the LORD; and how much more after my death? 
Gather unto me a2l the elders of your tribes, and your o2ficers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and ca2l heaven and earth to record against them. 
For I know that after my death ye wi2l u2terly co2rupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have co2manded you; and evil wi2l befa2l you in the la2ter days; because ye wi2l do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands. 
And Moses spake in the ears of a2l the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended. 
Give ear, O ye heavens, and I wi2l speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth. 
My doctrine sha2l drop as the rain, my sp2ech sha2l distil as the dew, as the sma2l rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the gra2s: 
Because I wi2l publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye greatne2s unto our God. 
He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for a2l his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he. 
They have co2rupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and cr2oked generation. 
Do ye thus requite the LORD, O f2olish people and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought th2e? hath he not made th2e, and established th2e? 
Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he wi2l shew th2e; thy elders, and they wi2l te2l th2e. 
When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people a2cording to the number of the children of Israel. 
For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance. 
He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderne2s; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the a2ple of his eye. 
As an eagle sti2reth up her nest, flu2tereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: 
So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him. 
He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock; 
Bu2ter of kine, and milk of sh2ep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the br2ed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure bl2od of the grape. 
But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatne2s; then he fors2ok God which made him, and lightly est2emed the Rock of his salvation. 
They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger. 
They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not. 
Of the Rock that begat th2e thou art unmindful, and hast forgo2ten God that formed th2e. 
And when the LORD saw it, he abho2red them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters. 
And he said, I wi2l hide my face from them, I wi2l s2e what their end sha2l be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith. 
They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I wi2l move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I wi2l provoke them to anger with a f2olish nation. 
For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and sha2l burn unto the lowest he2l, and sha2l consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains. 
I wi2l heap mischiefs upon them; I wi2l spend mine a2rows upon them. 
They sha2l be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bi2ter destruction: I wi2l also send the t2eth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust. 
The sword without, and te2ror within, sha2l destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs. 
I said, I would sca2ter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men: 
Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done a2l this. 
For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them. 
O that they were wise, that they underst2od this, that they would consider their la2ter end! 
How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up? 
For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges. 
For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomo2rah: their grapes are grapes of ga2l, their clusters are bi2ter: 
Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps. 
Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures? 
To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their f2ot sha2l slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that sha2l come upon them make haste. 
For the LORD sha2l judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he s2eth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left. 
And he sha2l say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted, 
Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink o2ferings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection. 
S2e now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I ki2l, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand. 
For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever. 
If I whet my gli2tering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I wi2l render vengeance to mine enemies, and wi2l reward them that hate me. 
I wi2l make mine a2rows drunk with bl2od, and my sword sha2l devour flesh; and that with the bl2od of the slain and of the captives, from the begi2ning of revenges upon the enemy. 
Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he wi2l avenge the bl2od of his servants, and wi2l render vengeance to his adversaries, and wi2l be merciful unto his land, and to his people. 
And Moses came and spake a2l the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun. 
And Moses made an end of speaking a2l these words to a2l Israel: 
And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto a2l the words which I testify among you this day, which ye sha2l co2mand your children to observe to do, a2l the words of this law. 
For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing ye sha2l prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to po2se2s it. 
And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying, 
Get th2e up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Can2an, which I give unto the children of Israel for a po2se2sion: 
And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people: 
Because ye trespa2sed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderne2s of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel. 
Yet thou shalt s2e the land before th2e; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel. 
And this is the ble2sing, wherewith Moses the man of God ble2sed the children of Israel before his death. 
And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them. 
Yea, he loved the people; a2l his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy f2et; every one sha2l receive of thy words. 
Moses co2manded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob. 
And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together. 
Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few. 
And this is the ble2sing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be su2ficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies. 
And of Levi he said, Let thy Thu2mim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Ma2sah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah; 
Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not s2en him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant. 
They sha2l teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they sha2l put incense before th2e, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar. 
Ble2s, LORD, his substance, and a2cept the work of his hands; smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again. 
And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD sha2l dwe2l in safety by him; and the Lord sha2l cover him a2l the day long, and he sha2l dwe2l betw2en his shoulders. 
And of Joseph he said, Ble2sed of the LORD be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the d2ep that coucheth beneath, 
And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the m2on, 
And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hi2ls, 
And for the precious things of the earth and fulne2s thereof, and for the g2od wi2l of him that dwelt in the bush: let the ble2sing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren. 
His glory is like the firstling of his bu2lock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he sha2l push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Mana2seh. 
And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, I2sachar, in thy tents. 
They sha2l ca2l the people unto the mountain; there they sha2l o2fer sacrifices of righteousne2s: for they sha2l suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand. 
And of Gad he said, Ble2sed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwe2leth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head. 
And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel. 
And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he sha2l leap from Bashan. 
And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and fu2l with the ble2sing of the LORD: po2se2s thou the west and the south. 
And of Asher he said, Let Asher be ble2sed with children; let him be a2ceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his f2ot in oil. 
Thy shoes sha2l be iron and bra2s; and as thy days, so sha2l thy strength be. 
There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his exce2lency on the sky. 
The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he sha2l thrust out the enemy from before th2e; and sha2l say, Destroy them. 
Israel then sha2l dwe2l in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob sha2l be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens sha2l drop down dew. 
Ha2py art thou, O Israel: who is like unto th2e, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy exce2lency! and thine enemies sha2l be found liars unto th2e; and thou shalt tread upon their high places. 
And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the LORD shewed him a2l the land of Gilead, unto Dan, 
And a2l Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Mana2seh, and a2l the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, 
And the south, and the plain of the va2ley of Jericho, the city of palm tr2es, unto Zoar. 
And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Is2ac, and unto Jacob, saying, I wi2l give it unto thy s2ed: I have caused th2e to s2e it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither. 
So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, a2cording to the word of the LORD. 
And he buried him in a va2ley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day. 
And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. 
And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of w2eping and mourning for Moses were ended. 
And Joshua the son of Nun was fu2l of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face, 
In a2l the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to a2l his servants, and to a2l his land, 
And in a2l that mighty hand, and in a2l the great te2ror which Moses shewed in the sight of a2l Israel. 
Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pa2s, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying, 
Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and a2l this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel. 
Every place that the sole of your f2ot sha2l tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses. 
From the wilderne2s and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, a2l the land of the Hi2tites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, sha2l be your coast. 
There sha2l not any man be able to stand before th2e a2l the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I wi2l be with th2e: I wi2l not fail th2e, nor forsake th2e. 
Be strong and of a g2od courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them. 
Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do a2cording to a2l the law, which Moses my servant co2manded th2e: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest. 
This b2ok of the law sha2l not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do a2cording to a2l that is wri2ten therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have g2od su2ce2s. 
Have not I co2manded th2e? Be strong and of a g2od courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with th2e whithersoever thou goest. 
Then Joshua co2manded the o2ficers of the people, saying, 
Pa2s through the host, and co2mand the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within thr2e days ye sha2l pa2s over this Jordan, to go in to po2se2s the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to po2se2s it. 
And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Mana2seh, spake Joshua, saying, 
Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD co2manded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land. 
Your wives, your li2tle ones, and your ca2tle, sha2l remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye sha2l pa2s before your brethren armed, a2l the mighty men of valour, and help them; 
Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have po2se2sed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye sha2l return unto the land of your po2se2sion, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising. 
And they answered Joshua, saying, A2l that thou co2mandest us we wi2l do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we wi2l go. 
A2cording as we hearkened unto Moses in a2l things, so wi2l we hearken unto th2e: only the LORD thy God be with th2e, as he was with Moses. 
Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy co2mandment, and wi2l not hearken unto thy words in a2l that thou co2mandest him, he sha2l be put to death: only be strong and of a g2od courage. 
And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shi2tim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there. 
And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country. 
And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to th2e, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out a2l the country. 
And the woman t2ok the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were: 
And it came to pa2s about the time of shu2ting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye sha2l overtake them. 
But she had brought them up to the r2of of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the r2of. 
And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as s2on as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate. 
And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the r2of; 
And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your te2ror is fa2len upon us, and that a2l the inhabitants of the land faint because of you. 
For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye u2terly destroyed. 
And as s2on as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath. 
Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindne2s, that ye wi2l also shew kindne2s unto my father's house, and give me a true token: 
And that ye wi2l save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and a2l that they have, and deliver our lives from death. 
And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye u2ter not this our busine2s. And it sha2l be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we wi2l deal kindly and truly with th2e. 
Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town wa2l, and she dwelt upon the wa2l. 
And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers m2et you; and hide yourselves there thr2e days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way. 
And the men said unto her, We wi2l be blamele2s of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear. 
Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and a2l thy father's household, home unto th2e. 
And it sha2l be, that whosoever sha2l go out of the d2ors of thy house into the str2et, his bl2od sha2l be upon his head, and we wi2l be guiltle2s: and whosoever sha2l be with th2e in the house, his bl2od sha2l be on our head, if any hand be upon him. 
And if thou u2ter this our busine2s, then we wi2l be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear. 
And she said, A2cording unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window. 
And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there thr2e days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout a2l the way, but found them not. 
So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and pa2sed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him a2l things that befe2l them: 
And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands a2l the land; for even a2l the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us. 
And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shi2tim, and came to Jordan, he and a2l the children of Israel, and lodged there before they pa2sed over. 
And it came to pa2s after thr2e days, that the o2ficers went through the host; 
And they co2manded the people, saying, When ye s2e the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye sha2l remove from your place, and go after it. 
Yet there sha2l be a space betw2en you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not pa2sed this way heretofore. 
And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to mo2row the LORD wi2l do wonders among you. 
And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pa2s over before the people. And they t2ok up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people. 
And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day wi2l I begin to magnify th2e in the sight of a2l Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I wi2l be with th2e. 
And thou shalt co2mand the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye sha2l stand sti2l in Jordan. 
And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God. 
And Joshua said, Hereby ye sha2l know that the living God is among you, and that he wi2l without fail drive out from before you the Can2anites, and the Hi2tites, and the Hivites, and the Peri2zites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites. 
Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of a2l the earth pa2seth over before you into Jordan. 
Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, as s2on as the soles of the f2et of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of a2l the earth, sha2l rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan sha2l be cut o2f from the waters that come down from above; and they sha2l stand upon an heap. 
And it came to pa2s, when the people removed from their tents, to pa2s over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people; 
And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the f2et of the priests that bare the ark were di2ped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth a2l his banks a2l the time of harvest,) 
That the waters which came down from above st2od and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut o2f: and the people pa2sed over right against Jericho. 
And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD st2od firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and a2l the Israelites pa2sed over on dry ground, until a2l the people were pa2sed clean over Jordan. 
And it came to pa2s, when a2l the people were clean pa2sed over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying, 
Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man, 
And co2mand ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' f2et st2od firm, twelve stones, and ye sha2l ca2ry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye sha2l lodge this night. 
Then Joshua ca2led the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man: 
And Joshua said unto them, Pa2s over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, a2cording unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel: 
That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones? 
Then ye sha2l answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut o2f before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it pa2sed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut o2f: and these stones sha2l be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever. 
And the children of Israel did so as Joshua co2manded, and t2ok up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto Joshua, a2cording to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and ca2ried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there. 
And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the f2et of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant st2od: and they are there unto this day. 
For the priests which bare the ark st2od in the midst of Jordan, until everything was finished that the LORD co2manded Joshua to speak unto the people, a2cording to a2l that Moses co2manded Joshua: and the people hasted and pa2sed over. 
And it came to pa2s, when a2l the people were clean pa2sed over, that the ark of the LORD pa2sed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people. 
And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Mana2seh, pa2sed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them: 
About forty thousand prepared for war pa2sed over before the LORD unto ba2tle, to the plains of Jericho. 
On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of a2l Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, a2l the days of his life. 
And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying, 
Co2mand the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan. 
Joshua therefore co2manded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan. 
And it came to pa2s, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests' f2et were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over a2l his banks, as they did before. 
And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho. 
And those twelve stones, which they t2ok out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal. 
And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children sha2l ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones? 
Then ye sha2l let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land. 
For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were pa2sed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over: 
That a2l the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever. 
And it came to pa2s, when a2l the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and a2l the kings of the Can2anites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were pa2sed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel. 
At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make th2e sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time. 
And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hi2l of the foreskins. 
And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: A2l the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even a2l the men of war, died in the wilderne2s by the way, after they came out of Egypt. 
Now a2l the people that came out were circumcised: but a2l the people that were born in the wilderne2s by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised. 
For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderne2s, ti2l a2l the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey. 
And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way. 
And it came to pa2s, when they had done circumcising a2l the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, ti2l they were whole. 
And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I ro2led away the reproach of Egypt from o2f you. Wherefore the name of the place is ca2led Gilgal unto this day. 
And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the pa2sover on the fourt2enth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho. 
And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the mo2row after the pa2sover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day. 
And the ma2na ceased on the mo2row after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel ma2na any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Can2an that year. 
And it came to pa2s, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and l2oked, and, behold, there st2od a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries? 
And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fe2l on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my Lord unto his servant? 
And the captain of the LORD's host said unto Joshua, L2ose thy shoe from o2f thy f2ot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so. 
Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in. 
And the LORD said unto Joshua, S2e, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour. 
And ye sha2l compa2s the city, a2l ye men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days. 
And seven priests sha2l bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day ye sha2l compa2s the city seven times, and the priests sha2l blow with the trumpets. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, a2l the people sha2l shout with a great shout; and the wa2l of the city sha2l fa2l down flat, and the people sha2l ascend up every man straight before him. 
And Joshua the son of Nun ca2led the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD. 
And he said unto the people, Pa2s on, and compa2s the city, and let him that is armed pa2s on before the ark of the LORD. 
And it came to pa2s, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns pa2sed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD fo2lowed them. 
And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets. 
And Joshua had co2manded the people, saying, Ye sha2l not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither sha2l any word proc2ed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then sha2l ye shout. 
So the ark of the LORD compa2sed the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp. 
And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests t2ok up the ark of the LORD. 
And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continua2ly, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets. 
And the second day they compa2sed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days. 
And it came to pa2s on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compa2sed the city after the same ma2ner seven times: only on that day they compa2sed the city seven times. 
And it came to pa2s at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city. 
And the city sha2l be a2cursed, even it, and a2l that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot sha2l live, she and a2l that are with her in the house, because she hid the me2sengers that we sent. 
And ye, in any wise k2ep yourselves from the a2cursed thing, lest ye make yourselves a2cursed, when ye take of the a2cursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it. 
But a2l the silver, and gold, and ve2sels of bra2s and iron, are consecrated unto the LORD: they sha2l come into the treasury of the LORD. 
So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pa2s, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wa2l fe2l down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they t2ok the city. 
And they u2terly destroyed a2l that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sh2ep, and a2s, with the edge of the sword. 
But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and a2l that she hath, as ye sware unto her. 
And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and a2l that she had; and they brought out a2l her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel. 
And they burnt the city with fire, and a2l that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the ve2sels of bra2s and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD. 
And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and a2l that she had; and she dwe2leth in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the me2sengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. 
And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he sha2l lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son sha2l he set up the gates of it. 
So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout a2l the country. 
But the children of Israel co2mi2ted a trespa2s in the a2cursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, t2ok of the a2cursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel. 
And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai. 
And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not a2l the people go up; but let about two or thr2e thousand men go up and smite Ai; and make not a2l the people to labour thither; for they are but few. 
So there went up thither of the people about thr2e thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai. 
And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water. 
And Joshua rent his clothes, and fe2l to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads. 
And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at a2l brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had b2en content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan! 
O LORD, what sha2l I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies! 
For the Can2anites and a2l the inhabitants of the land sha2l hear of it, and sha2l environ us round, and cut o2f our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name? 
And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get th2e up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face? 
Israel hath si2ned, and they have also transgre2sed my covenant which I co2manded them: for they have even taken of the a2cursed thing, and have also stolen, and di2sembled also, and they have put it even among their own stu2f. 
Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were a2cursed: neither wi2l I be with you any more, except ye destroy the a2cursed from among you. 
Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to mo2row: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an a2cursed thing in the midst of th2e, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the a2cursed thing from among you. 
In the morning therefore ye sha2l be brought a2cording to your tribes: and it sha2l be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh sha2l come a2cording to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD sha2l take sha2l come by households; and the household which the LORD sha2l take sha2l come man by man. 
And it sha2l be, that he that is taken with the a2cursed thing sha2l be burnt with fire, he and a2l that he hath: because he hath transgre2sed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought fo2ly in Israel. 
So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken: 
And he brought the family of Judah; and he t2ok the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken: 
And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken. 
And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray th2e, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confe2sion unto him; and te2l me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me. 
And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Ind2ed I have si2ned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done: 
When I saw among the spoils a g2odly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and t2ok them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it. 
So Joshua sent me2sengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it. 
And they t2ok them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto a2l the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD. 
And Joshua, and a2l Israel with him, t2ok Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his a2ses, and his sh2ep, and his tent, and a2l that he had: and they brought them unto the va2ley of Achor. 
And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD sha2l trouble th2e this day. And a2l Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones. 
And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fiercene2s of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was ca2led, The va2ley of Achor, unto this day. 
And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take a2l the people of war with th2e, and arise, go up to Ai: s2e, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land: 
And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the ca2tle thereof, sha2l ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay th2e an ambush for the city behind it. 
So Joshua arose, and a2l the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night. 
And he co2manded them, saying, Behold, ye sha2l lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye a2l ready: 
And I, and a2l the people that are with me, wi2l a2proach unto the city: and it sha2l come to pa2s, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we wi2l fl2e before them, 
(For they wi2l come out after us) ti2l we have drawn them from the city; for they wi2l say, They fl2e before us, as at the first: therefore we wi2l fl2e before them. 
Then ye sha2l rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God wi2l deliver it into your hand. 
And it sha2l be, when ye have taken the city, that ye sha2l set the city on fire: a2cording to the co2mandment of the LORD sha2l ye do. S2e, I have co2manded you. 
Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode betw2en Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people. 
And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai. 
And a2l the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a va2ley betw2en them and Ai. 
And he t2ok about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush betw2en Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city. 
And when they had set the people, even a2l the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the va2ley. 
And it came to pa2s, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to ba2tle, he and a2l his people, at a time a2pointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city. 
And Joshua and a2l Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderne2s. 
And a2l the people that were in Ai were ca2led together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city. 
And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel. 
And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward Ai; for I wi2l give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city. 
And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as s2on as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and t2ok it, and hasted and set the city on fire. 
And when the men of Ai l2oked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to fl2e this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderne2s turned back upon the pursuers. 
And when Joshua and a2l Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai. 
And the other i2sued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape. 
And the king of Ai they t2ok alive, and brought him to Joshua. 
And it came to pa2s, when Israel had made an end of slaying a2l the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderne2s wherein they chased them, and when they were a2l fa2len on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that a2l the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword. 
And so it was, that a2l that fe2l that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even a2l the men of Ai. 
For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had u2terly destroyed a2l the inhabitants of Ai. 
Only the ca2tle and the spoil of that city Israel t2ok for a prey unto themselves, a2cording unto the word of the LORD which he co2manded Joshua. 
And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day. 
And the king of Ai he hanged on a tr2e until eventide: and as s2on as the sun was down, Joshua co2manded that they should take his carcase down from the tr2e, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day. 
Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal, 
As Moses the servant of the LORD co2manded the children of Israel, as it is wri2ten in the b2ok of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they o2fered thereon burnt o2ferings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace o2ferings. 
And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel. 
And a2l Israel, and their elders, and o2ficers, and their judges, st2od on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as we2l the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had co2manded before, that they should ble2s the people of Israel. 
And afterward he read a2l the words of the law, the ble2sings and cursings, a2cording to a2l that is wri2ten in the b2ok of the law. 
There was not a word of a2l that Moses co2manded, which Joshua read not before a2l the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the li2tle ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them. 
And it came to pa2s, when a2l the kings which were on this side Jordan, in the hi2ls, and in the va2leys, and in a2l the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hi2tite, and the Amorite, the Can2anite, the Peri2zite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof; 
That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one a2cord. 
And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai, 
They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had b2en amba2sadors, and t2ok old sacks upon their a2ses, and wine bo2tles, old, and rent, and bound up; 
And old shoes and clouted upon their f2et, and old garments upon them; and a2l the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy. 
And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us. 
And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwe2l among us; and how sha2l we make a league with you? 
And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye? 
And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and a2l that he did in Egypt, 
And a2l that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth. 
Wherefore our elders and a2l the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to m2et them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us. 
This our bread we t2ok hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy: 
And these bo2tles of wine, which we fi2led, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey. 
And the men t2ok of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD. 
And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them. 
And it came to pa2s at the end of thr2e days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them. 
And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and B2eroth, and Kirjathjearim. 
And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And a2l the congregation murmured against the princes. 
But a2l the princes said unto a2l the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them. 
This we wi2l do to them; we wi2l even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them. 
And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of w2od and drawers of water unto a2l the congregation; as the princes had promised them. 
And Joshua ca2led for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwe2l among us? 
Now therefore ye are cursed, and there sha2l none of you be fr2ed from being bondmen, and hewers of w2od and drawers of water for the house of my God. 
And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God co2manded his servant Moses to give you a2l the land, and to destroy a2l the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing. 
And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it s2emeth g2od and right unto th2e to do unto us, do. 
And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not. 
And Joshua made them that day hewers of w2od and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should ch2ose. 
Now it came to pa2s, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had u2terly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them; 
That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and a2l the men thereof were mighty. 
Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying, 
Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel. 
Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and a2l their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it. 
And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for a2l the kings of the Amorites that dwe2l in the mountains are gathered together against us. 
So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and a2l the people of war with him, and a2l the mighty men of valour. 
And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there sha2l not a man of them stand before th2e. 
Joshua therefore came unto them su2denly, and went up from Gilgal a2l night. 
And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Bet2horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Ma2kedah. 
And it came to pa2s, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Bet2horon, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword. 
Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou sti2l upon Gibeon; and thou, M2on, in the va2ley of Ajalon. 
And the sun st2od sti2l, and the m2on stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this wri2ten in the b2ok of Jasher? So the sun st2od sti2l in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day. 
And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel. 
And Joshua returned, and a2l Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal. 
But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Ma2kedah. 
And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Ma2kedah. 
And Joshua said, Ro2l great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to k2ep them: 
And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; su2fer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand. 
And it came to pa2s, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, ti2l they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities. 
And a2l the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Ma2kedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel. 
Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave. 
And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. 
And it came to pa2s, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua ca2led for a2l the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your f2et upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their f2et upon the necks of them. 
And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of g2od courage: for thus sha2l the LORD do to a2l your enemies against whom ye fight. 
And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five tr2es: and they were hanging upon the tr2es until the evening. 
And it came to pa2s at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua co2manded, and they t2ok them down o2f the tr2es, and cast them into the cave wherein they had b2en hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day. 
And that day Joshua t2ok Ma2kedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he u2terly destroyed, them, and a2l the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Ma2kedah as he did unto the king of Jericho. 
Then Joshua pa2sed from Ma2kedah, and a2l Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah: 
And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and a2l the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho. 
And Joshua pa2sed from Libnah, and a2l Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it: 
And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which t2ok it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and a2l the souls that were therein, a2cording to a2l that he had done to Libnah. 
Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining. 
And from Lachish Joshua pa2sed unto Eglon, and a2l Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it: 
And they t2ok it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and a2l the souls that were therein he u2terly destroyed that day, a2cording to a2l that he had done to Lachish. 
And Joshua went up from Eglon, and a2l Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it: 
And they t2ok it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and a2l the cities thereof, and a2l the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, a2cording to a2l that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it u2terly, and a2l the souls that were therein. 
And Joshua returned, and a2l Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it: 
And he t2ok it, and the king thereof, and a2l the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and u2terly destroyed a2l the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king. 
So Joshua smote a2l the country of the hi2ls, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and a2l their kings: he left none remaining, but u2terly destroyed a2l that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel co2manded. 
And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and a2l the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon. 
And a2l these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel. 
And Joshua returned, and a2l Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal. 
And it came to pa2s, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph, 
And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chi2neroth, and in the va2ley, and in the borders of Dor on the west, 
And to the Can2anite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hi2tite, and the Peri2zite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh. 
And they went out, they and a2l their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many. 
And when a2l these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel. 
And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to mo2row about this time wi2l I deliver them up a2l slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire. 
So Joshua came, and a2l the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom su2denly; and they fe2l upon them. 
And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto the va2ley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining. 
And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire. 
And Joshua at that time turned back, and t2ok Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of a2l those kingdoms. 
And they smote a2l the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, u2terly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire. 
And a2l the cities of those kings, and a2l the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he u2terly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD co2manded. 
But as for the cities that st2od sti2l in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn. 
And a2l the spoil of these cities, and the ca2tle, the children of Israel t2ok for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe. 
As the LORD co2manded Moses his servant, so did Moses co2mand Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of a2l that the LORD co2manded Moses. 
So Joshua t2ok a2l that land, the hi2ls, and a2l the south country, and a2l the land of Goshen, and the va2ley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the va2ley of the same; 
Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto B2algad in the va2ley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and a2l their kings he t2ok, and smote them, and slew them. 
Joshua made war a long time with a2l those kings. 
There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: a2l other they t2ok in ba2tle. 
For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in ba2tle, that he might destroy them u2terly, and that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD co2manded Moses. 
And at that time came Joshua, and cut o2f the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from a2l the mountains of Judah, and from a2l the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them u2terly with their cities. 
There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained. 
So Joshua t2ok the whole land, a2cording to a2l that the LORD said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel a2cording to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war. 
Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel smote, and po2se2sed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and a2l the plain on the east: 
Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the mi2dle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto the river Ja2bok, which is the border of the children of A2mon; 
And from the plain to the sea of Chi2neroth on the east, and unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah: 
And the coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, 
And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in a2l Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the M2achathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon. 
Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a po2se2sion unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Mana2seh. 
And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from B2algad in the va2ley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a po2se2sion a2cording to their divisions; 
In the mountains, and in the va2leys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderne2s, and in the south country; the Hi2tites, the Amorites, and the Can2anites, the Peri2zites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: 
The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one; 
The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 
The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; 
The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; 
The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one; 
The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one; 
The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adu2lam, one; 
The king of Ma2kedah, one; the king of Bethel, one; 
The king of Ta2puah, one; the king of Hepher, one; 
The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one; 
The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one; 
The king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph, one; 
The king of T2anach, one; the king of Megi2do, one; 
The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one; 
The king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the nations of Gilgal, one; 
The king of Tirzah, one: a2l the kings thirty and one. 
Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said unto him, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be po2se2sed. 
This is the land that yet remaineth: a2l the borders of the Philistines, and a2l Geshuri, 
From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Can2anite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gi2tites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites: 
From the south, a2l the land of the Can2anites, and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites: 
And the land of the Giblites, and a2l Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from B2algad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath. 
A2l the inhabitants of the hi2l country from Lebanon unto Misrephothmaim, and a2l the Sidonians, them wi2l I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have co2manded th2e. 
Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Mana2seh, 
With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them; 
From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and a2l the plain of Medeba unto Dibon; 
And a2l the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of A2mon; 
And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and M2achathites, and a2l mount Hermon, and a2l Bashan unto Salcah; 
A2l the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses smite, and cast them out. 
Neverthele2s the children of Israel expe2led not the Geshurites, nor the M2achathites: but the Geshurites and the M2achathites dwe2l among the Israelites until this day. 
Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as he said unto them. 
And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance a2cording to their families. 
And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and a2l the plain by Medeba; 
Heshbon, and a2l her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamothb2al, and Bethb2almeon, 
And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Meph2ath, 
And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mount of the va2ley, 
And Bethpeor, and Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth, 
And a2l the cities of the plain, and a2l the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwe2ling in the country. 
Bal2am also the son of Beor, the s2othsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them. 
And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and the vi2lages thereof. 
And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto the children of Gad a2cording to their families. 
And their coast was Jazer, and a2l the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of A2mon, unto Aroer that is before Ra2bah; 
And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir; 
And in the va2ley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Su2coth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his border, even unto the edge of the sea of Chi2nereth on the other side Jordan eastward. 
This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their vi2lages. 
And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Mana2seh: and this was the po2se2sion of the half tribe of the children of Mana2seh by their families. 
And their coast was from Mahanaim, a2l Bashan, a2l the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and a2l the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, thr2escore cities: 
And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of Mana2seh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families. 
These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward. 
But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto them. 
And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Can2an, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them. 
By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD co2manded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe. 
For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them. 
For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Mana2seh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwe2l in, with their suburbs for their ca2tle and for their substance. 
As the LORD co2manded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land. 
Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephu2neh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and th2e in Kadeshbarnea. 
Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart. 
Neverthele2s my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I who2ly fo2lowed the LORD my God. 
And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy f2et have tro2den sha2l be thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever, because thou hast who2ly fo2lowed the LORD my God. 
And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderne2s: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old. 
As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in. 
Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD wi2l be with me, then I sha2l be able to drive them out, as the LORD said. 
And Joshua ble2sed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephu2neh Hebron for an inheritance. 
Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephu2neh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he who2ly fo2lowed the LORD God of Israel. 
And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war. 
This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderne2s of Zin southward was the u2termost part of the south coast. 
And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that l2oketh southward: 
And it went out to the south side to M2alehacra2bim, and pa2sed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and pa2sed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compa2s to Kark2a: 
From thence it pa2sed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this sha2l be your south coast. 
And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of Jordan. And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the u2termost part of Jordan: 
And the border went up to Bet2hogla, and pa2sed along by the north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben: 
And the border went up toward Debir from the va2ley of Achor, and so northward, l2oking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adu2mim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border pa2sed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel: 
And the border went up by the va2ley of the son of Hi2nom unto the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the va2ley of Hi2nom westward, which is at the end of the va2ley of the giants northward: 
And the border was drawn from the top of the hi2l unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to B2alah, which is Kirjathjearim: 
And the border compa2sed from B2alah westward unto mount Seir, and pa2sed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and pa2sed on to Timnah: 
And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and pa2sed along to mount B2alah, and went out unto Jabn2el; and the goings out of the border were at the sea. 
And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof. This is the coast of the children of Judah round about a2cording to their families. 
And unto Caleb the son of Jephu2neh he gave a part among the children of Judah, a2cording to the co2mandment of the LORD to Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron. 
And Caleb drove thence the thr2e sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak. 
And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher. 
And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him wi2l I give Achsah my daughter to wife. 
And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, t2ok it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. 
And it came to pa2s, as she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted o2f her a2s; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou? 
Who answered, Give me a ble2sing; for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the u2per springs, and the nether springs. 
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah a2cording to their families. 
And the u2termost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabz2el, and Eder, and Jagur, 
And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah, 
And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan, 
Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth, 
And Hazor, Hada2tah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor, 
Amam, and Shema, and Moladah, 
And Hazarga2dah, and Heshmon, and Bethpalet, 
And Hazarshual, and B2ersheba, and Bizjothjah, 
B2alah, and Iim, and Azem, 
And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah, 
And Ziklag, and Madma2nah, and Sansa2nah, 
And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Ri2mon: a2l the cities are twenty and nine, with their vi2lages: 
And in the va2ley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah, 
And Zanoah, and Enga2nim, Ta2puah, and Enam, 
Jarmuth, and Adu2lam, Socoh, and Azekah, 
And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourt2en cities with their vi2lages: 
Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdalgad, 
And Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Jokth2el, 
Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon, 
And Ca2bon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish, 
And Gederoth, Bethdagon, and N2amah, and Ma2kedah; sixt2en cities with their vi2lages: 
Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan, 
And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib, 
And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their vi2lages: 
Ekron, with her towns and her vi2lages: 
From Ekron even unto the sea, a2l that lay near Ashdod, with their vi2lages: 
Ashdod with her towns and her vi2lages, Gaza with her towns and her vi2lages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border thereof: 
And in the mountains, Shamir, and Ja2tir, and Socoh, 
And Da2nah, and Kirjathsa2nah, which is Debir, 
And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim, 
And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their vi2lages: 
Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean, 
And Janum, and Bethta2puah, and Aphekah, 
And Humtah, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, and Zior; nine cities with their vi2lages: 
Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Ju2tah, 
And Jezr2el, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah, 
Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their vi2lages: 
Halhul, Bethzur, and Gedor, 
And M2arath, and Bethanoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their vi2lages: 
Kirjathb2al, which is Kirjathjearim, and Ra2bah; two cities with their vi2lages: 
In the wilderne2s, Betharabah, Mi2din, and Secacah, 
And Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with their vi2lages. 
As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites dwe2l with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day. 
And the lot of the children of Joseph fe2l from Jordan by Jericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderne2s that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel, 
And goeth out from Bethel to Luz, and pa2seth along unto the borders of Archi to Ataroth, 
And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast of Bet2horon the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings out thereof are at the sea. 
So the children of Joseph, Mana2seh and Ephraim, t2ok their inheritance. 
And the border of the children of Ephraim a2cording to their families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Atarotha2dar, unto Bet2horon the u2per; 
And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border went about eastward unto T2anathshiloh, and pa2sed by it on the east to Janohah; 
And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to N2arath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan. 
The border went out from Ta2puah westward unto the river Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families. 
And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Mana2seh, a2l the cities with their vi2lages. 
And they drave not out the Can2anites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Can2anites dwe2l among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve under tribute. 
There was also a lot for the tribe of Mana2seh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Mana2seh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan. 
There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Mana2seh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were the male children of Mana2seh the son of Joseph by their families. 
But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Mana2seh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 
And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD co2manded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore a2cording to the co2mandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father. 
And there fe2l ten portions to Mana2seh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan; 
Because the daughters of Mana2seh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Mana2seh's sons had the land of Gilead. 
And the coast of Mana2seh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of Enta2puah. 
Now Mana2seh had the land of Ta2puah: but Ta2puah on the border of Mana2seh belonged to the children of Ephraim; 
And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Mana2seh: the coast of Mana2seh also was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea: 
Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Mana2seh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in I2sachar on the east. 
And Mana2seh had in I2sachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of T2anach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megi2do and her towns, even thr2e countries. 
Yet the children of Mana2seh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Can2anites would dwe2l in that land. 
Yet it came to pa2s, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Can2anites to tribute, but did not u2terly drive them out. 
And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, s2eing I am a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath ble2sed me hitherto? 
And Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get th2e up to the w2od country, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Peri2zites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be t2o na2row for th2e. 
And the children of Joseph said, The hi2l is not enough for us: and a2l the Can2anites that dwe2l in the land of the va2ley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and they who are of the va2ley of Jezr2el. 
And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Mana2seh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot only: 
But the mountain sha2l be thine; for it is a w2od, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it sha2l be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Can2anites, though they have iron chariots, and though they be strong. 
And the whole congregation of the children of Israel a2sembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them. 
And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance. 
And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye slack to go to po2se2s the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you? 
Give out from among you thr2e men for each tribe: and I wi2l send them, and they sha2l rise, and go through the land, and describe it a2cording to the inheritance of them; and they sha2l come again to me. 
And they sha2l divide it into seven parts: Judah sha2l abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph sha2l abide in their coasts on the north. 
Ye sha2l therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God. 
But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesth2od of the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Mana2seh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them. 
And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh. 
And the men went and pa2sed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a b2ok, and came again to Joshua to the host at Shiloh. 
And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel a2cording to their divisions. 
And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up a2cording to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth betw2en the children of Judah and the children of Joseph. 
And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderne2s of Bethaven. 
And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended to Atarothadar, near the hi2l that lieth on the south side of the nether Bet2horon. 
And the border was drawn thence, and compa2sed the corner of the sea southward, from the hi2l that lieth before Bet2horon southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathb2al, which is Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this was the west quarter. 
And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the we2l of waters of Nephtoah: 
And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth before the va2ley of the son of Hi2nom, and which is in the va2ley of the giants on the north, and descended to the va2ley of Hi2nom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel, 
And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up of Adu2mim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben, 
And pa2sed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah: 
And the border pa2sed along to the side of Bet2hoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the south coast. 
And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round about, a2cording to their families. 
Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin a2cording to their families were Jericho, and Bet2hoglah, and the va2ley of Keziz, 
And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel, 
And Avim, and Pharah, and Ophrah, 
And Chepharh2a2monai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their vi2lages: 
Gibeon, and Ramah, and B2eroth, 
And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah, 
And Rekem, and Irp2el, and Taralah, 
And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and Kirjath; fourt2en cities with their vi2lages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin a2cording to their families. 
And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon a2cording to their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah. 
And they had in their inheritance B2ersheba, and Sheba, and Moladah, 
And Hazarshual, and Balah, and Azem, 
And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah, 
And Ziklag, and Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah, 
And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirt2en cities and their vi2lages: 
Ain, Re2mon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their vi2lages: 
And a2l the vi2lages that were round about these cities to B2alathb2er, Ramath of the south. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon a2cording to their families. 
Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the children of Judah was t2o much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them. 
And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun a2cording to their families: and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid: 
And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and reached to Da2basheth, and reached to the river that is before Jokneam; 
And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chislothtabor, and then goeth out to Daberath, and goeth up to Japhia, 
And from thence pa2seth on along on the east to Gi2ta2hepher, to I2tahkazin, and goeth out to Re2monmethoar to Neah; 
And the border compa2seth it on the north side to Ha2nathon: and the outgoings thereof are in the va2ley of Jiphthahel: 
And Ka2tath, and Naha2lal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their vi2lages. 
This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun a2cording to their families, these cities with their vi2lages. 
And the fourth lot came out to I2sachar, for the children of I2sachar a2cording to their families. 
And their border was toward Jezr2el, and Chesu2loth, and Shunem, 
And Haphraim, and Shihon, and Anaharath, 
And Ra2bith, and Kishion, and Abez, 
And Remeth, and Enga2nim, and Enha2dah, and Bethpa2zez; 
And the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan: sixt2en cities with their vi2lages. 
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of I2sachar a2cording to their families, the cities and their vi2lages. 
And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher a2cording to their families. 
And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph, 
And Ala2melech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reacheth to Carmel westward, and to Shihorlibnath; 
And turneth toward the sunrising to Bethdagon, and reacheth to Zebulun, and to the va2ley of Jiphthahel toward the north side of Bethemek, and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand, 
And Hebron, and Rehob, and Ha2mon, and Kanah, even unto great Zidon; 
And then the coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city Tyre; and the coast turneth to Hosah; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib: 
U2mah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their vi2lages. 
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher a2cording to their families, these cities with their vi2lages. 
The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali a2cording to their families. 
And their coast was from Heleph, from A2lon to Z2ana2nim, and Adami, Nekeb, and Jabn2el, unto Lakum; and the outgoings thereof were at Jordan: 
And then the coast turneth westward to Aznothtabor, and goeth out from thence to Hu2kok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the south side, and reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to Judah upon Jordan toward the sunrising. 
And the fenced cities are Zi2dim, Zer, and Ha2math, Ra2kath, and Chi2nereth, 
And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor, 
And Kedesh, and Edrei, and Enhazor, 
And Iron, and Migdalel, Horem, and Bethanath, and Bethshemesh; ninet2en cities with their vi2lages. 
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali a2cording to their families, the cities and their vi2lages. 
And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan a2cording to their families. 
And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Irshemesh, 
And Sh2ala2bin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah, 
And Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron, 
And Eltekeh, and Gi2bethon, and B2alath, 
And Jehud, and Beneberak, and Gathri2mon, 
And Mejarkon, and Ra2kon, with the border before Japho. 
And the coast of the children of Dan went out t2o li2tle for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and t2ok it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and po2se2sed it, and dwelt therein, and ca2led Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father. 
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan a2cording to their families, these cities with their vi2lages. 
When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them: 
A2cording to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnathserah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt therein. 
These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing the country. 
The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying, 
Speak to the children of Israel, saying, A2point out for you cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses: 
That the slayer that ki2leth any person unawares and unwi2tingly may fl2e thither: and they sha2l be your refuge from the avenger of bl2od. 
And when he that doth fl2e unto one of those cities sha2l stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and sha2l declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they sha2l take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwe2l among them. 
And if the avenger of bl2od pursue after him, then they sha2l not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour unwi2tingly, and hated him not beforetime. 
And he sha2l dwe2l in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high priest that sha2l be in those days: then sha2l the slayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled. 
And they a2pointed Kedesh in Galil2e in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah. 
And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they a2signed Bezer in the wilderne2s upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Mana2seh. 
These were the cities a2pointed for a2l the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever ki2leth any person at unawares might fl2e thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of bl2od, until he st2od before the congregation. 
Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel; 
And they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Can2an, saying, The LORD co2manded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwe2l in, with the suburbs thereof for our ca2tle. 
And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance, at the co2mandment of the LORD, these cities and their suburbs. 
And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirt2en cities. 
And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half tribe of Mana2seh, ten cities. 
And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of I2sachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of Mana2seh in Bashan, thirt2en cities. 
The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities. 
And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as the LORD co2manded by the hand of Moses. 
And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are here mentioned by name. 
Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs was the first lot. 
And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron, in the hi2l country of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about it. 
But the fields of the city, and the vi2lages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephu2neh for his po2se2sion. 
Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with her suburbs, 
And Ja2tir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs, 
And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs, 
And Ain with her suburbs, and Ju2tah with her suburbs, and Bethshemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes. 
And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba with her suburbs, 
Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four cities. 
A2l the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were thirt2en cities with their suburbs. 
And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim. 
For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her suburbs, 
And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bet2horon with her suburbs; four cities. 
And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gi2bethon with her suburbs, 
Aijalon with her suburbs, Gathri2mon with her suburbs; four cities. 
And out of the half tribe of Mana2seh, Tanach with her suburbs, and Gathri2mon with her suburbs; two cities. 
A2l the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of the children of Kohath that remained. 
And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the other half tribe of Mana2seh they gave Golan in Bashan with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and B2eshterah with her suburbs; two cities. 
And out of the tribe of I2sachar, Kishon with her suburbs, Dabareh with her suburbs, 
Jarmuth with her suburbs, Enga2nim with her suburbs; four cities. 
And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon with her suburbs, 
Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbs; four cities. 
And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galil2e with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Ha2mothdor with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; thr2e cities. 
A2l the cities of the Gershonites a2cording to their families were thirt2en cities with their suburbs. 
And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her suburbs, and Kartah with her suburbs, 
Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four cities. 
And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and Jahazah with her suburbs, 
Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Meph2ath with her suburbs; four cities. 
And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim with her suburbs, 
Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities in a2l. 
So a2l the cities for the children of Merari by their families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were by their lot twelve cities. 
A2l the cities of the Levites within the po2se2sion of the children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their suburbs. 
These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus were a2l these cities. 
And the LORD gave unto Israel a2l the land which he sware to give unto their fathers; and they po2se2sed it, and dwelt therein. 
And the LORD gave them rest round about, a2cording to a2l that he sware unto their fathers: and there st2od not a man of a2l their enemies before them; the LORD delivered a2l their enemies into their hand. 
There failed not ought of any g2od thing which the LORD had spoken unto the house of Israel; a2l came to pa2s. 
Then Joshua ca2led the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Mana2seh, 
And said unto them, Ye have kept a2l that Moses the servant of the LORD co2manded you, and have obeyed my voice in a2l that I co2manded you: 
Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the co2mandment of the LORD your God. 
And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your tents, and unto the land of your po2se2sion, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan. 
But take diligent h2ed to do the co2mandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in a2l his ways, and to k2ep his co2mandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with a2l your heart and with a2l your soul. 
So Joshua ble2sed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents. 
Now to the one half of the tribe of Mana2seh Moses had given po2se2sion in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he ble2sed them, 
And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much ca2tle, with silver, and with gold, and with bra2s, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren. 
And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Mana2seh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Can2an, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their po2se2sion, whereof they were po2se2sed, a2cording to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses. 
And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the land of Can2an, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Mana2seh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to s2e to. 
And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Mana2seh have built an altar over against the land of Can2an, in the borders of Jordan, at the pa2sage of the children of Israel. 
And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them. 
And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Mana2seh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, 
And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout a2l the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel. 
And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Mana2seh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying, 
Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespa2s is this that ye have co2mi2ted against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from fo2lowing the LORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the LORD? 
Is the iniquity of Peor t2o li2tle for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD, 
But that ye must turn away this day from fo2lowing the LORD? and it wi2l be, s2eing ye rebel to day against the LORD, that to mo2row he wi2l be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel. 
Notwithstanding, if the land of your po2se2sion be unclean, then pa2s ye over unto the land of the po2se2sion of the LORD, wherein the LORD's tabernacle dwe2leth, and take po2se2sion among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God. 
Did not Achan the son of Zerah co2mit a trespa2s in the a2cursed thing, and wrath fe2l on a2l the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity. 
Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Mana2seh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel, 
The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he sha2l know; if it be in rebe2lion, or if in transgre2sion against the LORD, (save us not this day,) 
That we have built us an altar to turn from fo2lowing the LORD, or if to o2fer thereon burnt o2fering or meat o2fering, or if to o2fer peace o2ferings thereon, let the LORD himself require it; 
And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel? 
For the LORD hath made Jordan a border betw2en us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD: so sha2l your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD. 
Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt o2fering, nor for sacrifice: 
But that it may be a witne2s betw2en us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt o2ferings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace o2ferings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD. 
Therefore said we, that it sha2l be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pa2tern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt o2ferings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witne2s betw2en us and you. 
God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from fo2lowing the LORD, to build an altar for burnt o2ferings, for meat o2ferings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle. 
And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Mana2seh spake, it pleased them. 
And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Mana2seh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because ye have not co2mi2ted this trespa2s against the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD. 
And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Can2an, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again. 
And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel ble2sed God, and did not intend to go up against them in ba2tle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt. 
And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad ca2led the altar Ed: for it sha2l be a witne2s betw2en us that the LORD is God. 
And it came to pa2s a long time after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from a2l their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old and stricken in age. 
And Joshua ca2led for a2l Israel, and for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their o2ficers, and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age: 
And ye have s2en a2l that the LORD your God hath done unto a2l these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you. 
Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with a2l the nations that I have cut o2f, even unto the great sea westward. 
And the LORD your God, he sha2l expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye sha2l po2se2s their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you. 
Be ye therefore very courageous to k2ep and to do a2l that is wri2ten in the b2ok of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left; 
That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them: 
But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day. 
For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath b2en able to stand before you unto this day. 
One man of you sha2l chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you. 
Take g2od h2ed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God. 
Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and sha2l make ma2riages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you: 
Know for a certainty that the LORD your God wi2l no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they sha2l be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from o2f this g2od land which the LORD your God hath given you. 
And, behold, this day I am going the way of a2l the earth: and ye know in a2l your hearts and in a2l your souls, that not one thing hath failed of a2l the g2od things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; a2l are come to pa2s unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof. 
Therefore it sha2l come to pa2s, that as a2l g2od things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so sha2l the LORD bring upon you a2l evil things, until he have destroyed you from o2f this g2od land which the LORD your God hath given you. 
When ye have transgre2sed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he co2manded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then sha2l the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye sha2l perish quickly from o2f the g2od land which he hath given unto you. 
And Joshua gathered a2l the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and ca2led for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their o2ficers; and they presented themselves before God. 
And Joshua said unto a2l the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the fl2od in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods. 
And I t2ok your father Abraham from the other side of the fl2od, and led him throughout a2l the land of Can2an, and multiplied his s2ed, and gave him Is2ac. 
And I gave unto Is2ac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to po2se2s it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt. 
I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, a2cording to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out. 
And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea. 
And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkne2s betw2en you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have s2en what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderne2s a long season. 
And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might po2se2s their land; and I destroyed them from before you. 
Then Balak the son of Zi2por, king of Moab, arose and wa2red against Israel, and sent and ca2led Bal2am the son of Beor to curse you: 
But I would not hearken unto Bal2am; therefore he ble2sed you sti2l: so I delivered you out of his hand. 
And you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Peri2zites, and the Can2anites, and the Hi2tites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand. 
And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword, nor with thy bow. 
And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwe2l in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat. 
Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the fl2od, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD. 
And if it s2em evil unto you to serve the LORD, ch2ose you this day whom ye wi2l serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the fl2od, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwe2l: but as for me and my house, we wi2l serve the LORD. 
And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods; 
For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in a2l the way wherein we went, and among a2l the people through whom we pa2sed: 
And the LORD drave out from before us a2l the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore wi2l we also serve the LORD; for he is our God. 
And Joshua said unto the people, Ye ca2not serve the LORD: for he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he wi2l not forgive your transgre2sions nor your sins. 
If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he wi2l turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you g2od. 
And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we wi2l serve the LORD. 
And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witne2ses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, We are witne2ses. 
Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel. 
And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God wi2l we serve, and his voice wi2l we obey. 
So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. 
And Joshua wrote these words in the b2ok of the law of God, and t2ok a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD. 
And Joshua said unto a2l the people, Behold, this stone sha2l be a witne2s unto us; for it hath heard a2l the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it sha2l be therefore a witne2s unto you, lest ye deny your God. 
So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance. 
And it came to pa2s after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old. 
And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hi2l of G2ash. 
And Israel served the LORD a2l the days of Joshua, and a2l the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known a2l the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel. 
And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph. 
And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hi2l that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim. 
Now after the death of Joshua it came to pa2s, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who sha2l go up for us against the Can2anites first, to fight against them? 
And the LORD said, Judah sha2l go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand. 
And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Can2anites; and I likewise wi2l go with th2e into thy lot. So Simeon went with him. 
And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Can2anites and the Peri2zites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men. 
And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Can2anites and the Peri2zites. 
But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut o2f his thumbs and his great toes. 
And Adonibezek said, Thr2escore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut o2f, gathered their meat under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died. 
Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smi2ten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire. 
And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Can2anites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the va2ley. 
And Judah went against the Can2anites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai. 
And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher: 
And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him wi2l I give Achsah my daughter to wife. 
And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, t2ok it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. 
And it came to pa2s, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from o2f her a2s; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou? 
And she said unto him, Give me a ble2sing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the u2per springs and the nether springs. 
And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm tr2es with the children of Judah into the wilderne2s of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people. 
And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Can2anites that inhabited Zephath, and u2terly destroyed it. And the name of the city was ca2led Hormah. 
Also Judah t2ok Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof. 
And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the va2ley, because they had chariots of iron. 
And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expe2led thence the thr2e sons of Anak. 
And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwe2l with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day. 
And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD was with them. 
And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.) 
And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray th2e, the entrance into the city, and we wi2l shew th2e mercy. 
And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and a2l his family. 
And the man went into the land of the Hi2tites, and built a city, and ca2led the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day. 
Neither did Mana2seh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor T2anach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megi2do and her towns: but the Can2anites would dwe2l in that land. 
And it came to pa2s, when Israel was strong, that they put the Can2anites to tribute, and did not u2terly drive them out. 
Neither did Ephraim drive out the Can2anites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Can2anites dwelt in Gezer among them. 
Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Can2anites dwelt among them, and became tributaries. 
Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of A2cho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob: 
But the Asherites dwelt among the Can2anites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out. 
Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Can2anites, the inhabitants of the land: neverthele2s the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them. 
And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not su2fer them to come down to the va2ley: 
But the Amorites would dwe2l in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Sh2albim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries. 
And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akra2bim, from the rock, and upward. 
And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I wi2l never break my covenant with you. 
And ye sha2l make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye sha2l throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this? 
Wherefore I also said, I wi2l not drive them out from before you; but they sha2l be as thorns in your sides, and their gods sha2l be a snare unto you. 
And it came to pa2s, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto a2l the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept. 
And they ca2led the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD. 
And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to po2se2s the land. 
And the people served the LORD a2l the days of Joshua, and a2l the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had s2en a2l the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel. 
And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old. 
And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnat2heres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hi2l G2ash. 
And also a2l that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel. 
And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served B2alim: 
And they fors2ok the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and fo2lowed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger. 
And they fors2ok the LORD, and served B2al and Ashtaroth. 
And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies. 
Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distre2sed. 
Neverthele2s the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them. 
And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the co2mandments of the LORD; but they did not so. 
And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies a2l the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that o2pre2sed them and vexed them. 
And it came to pa2s, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and co2rupted themselves more than their fathers, in fo2lowing other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stu2born way. 
And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgre2sed my covenant which I co2manded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice; 
I also wi2l not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died: 
That through them I may prove Israel, whether they wi2l k2ep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did k2ep it, or not. 
Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua. 
Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known a2l the wars of Can2an; 
Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof; 
Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and a2l the Can2anites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount B2alhermon unto the entering in of Hamath. 
And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the co2mandments of the LORD, which he co2manded their fathers by the hand of Moses. 
And the children of Israel dwelt among the Can2anites, Hi2tites, and Amorites, and Peri2zites, and Hivites, and Jebusites: 
And they t2ok their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods. 
And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served B2alim and the groves. 
Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years. 
And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother. 
And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim. 
And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died. 
And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD. 
And he gathered unto him the children of A2mon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and po2se2sed the city of palm tr2es. 
So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eight2en years. 
But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab. 
But Ehud made him a da2ger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh. 
And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man. 
And when he had made an end to o2fer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present. 
But he himself turned again from the qua2ries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret e2rand unto th2e, O king: who said, K2ep silence. And a2l that st2od by him went out from him. 
And Ehud came unto him; and he was si2ting in a su2mer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a me2sage from God unto th2e. And he arose out of his seat. 
And Ehud put forth his left hand, and t2ok the da2ger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his be2ly: 
And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the da2ger out of his be2ly; and the dirt came out. 
Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the d2ors of the parlour upon him, and locked them. 
When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the d2ors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his f2et in his su2mer chamber. 
And they ta2ried ti2l they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the d2ors of the parlour; therefore they t2ok a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fa2len down dead on the earth. 
And Ehud escaped while they ta2ried, and pa2sed beyond the qua2ries, and escaped unto Seirath. 
And it came to pa2s, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them. 
And he said unto them, Fo2low after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and t2ok the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and su2fered not a man to pa2s over. 
And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, a2l lusty, and a2l men of valour; and there escaped not a man. 
So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years. 
And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel. 
And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead. 
And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Can2an, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles. 
And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily o2pre2sed the children of Israel. 
And Deborah, a prophete2s, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time. 
And she dwelt under the palm tr2e of Deborah betw2en Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. 
And she sent and ca2led Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel co2manded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with th2e ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun? 
And I wi2l draw unto th2e to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I wi2l deliver him into thine hand. 
And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I wi2l go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I wi2l not go. 
And she said, I wi2l surely go with th2e: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest sha2l not be for thine honour; for the LORD sha2l se2l Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh. 
And Barak ca2led Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his f2et: and Deborah went up with him. 
Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Z2anaim, which is by Kedesh. 
And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor. 
And Sisera gathered together a2l his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and a2l the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon. 
And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before th2e? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him. 
And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and a2l his chariots, and a2l his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down o2f his chariot, and fled away on his f2et. 
But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and a2l the host of Sisera fe2l upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left. 
Howbeit Sisera fled away on his f2et to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace betw2en Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. 
And Jael went out to m2et Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle. 
And he said unto her, Give me, I pray th2e, a li2tle water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bo2tle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him. 
Again he said unto her, Stand in the d2or of the tent, and it sha2l be, when any man doth come and enquire of th2e, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No. 
Then Jael Heber's wife t2ok a nail of the tent, and t2ok an ha2mer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asl2ep and weary. So he died. 
And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to m2et him, and said unto him, Come, and I wi2l shew th2e the man whom thou s2ekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples. 
So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Can2an before the children of Israel. 
And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Can2an, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Can2an. 
Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying, 
Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people wi2lingly o2fered themselves. 
Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, wi2l sing unto the LORD; I wi2l sing praise to the LORD God of Israel. 
LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dro2ped, the clouds also dro2ped water. 
The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel. 
In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were uno2cupied, and the trave2lers walked through byways. 
The inhabitants of the vi2lages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel. 
They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear s2en among forty thousand in Israel? 
My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that o2fered themselves wi2lingly among the people. Ble2s ye the LORD. 
Speak, ye that ride on white a2ses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way. 
They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there sha2l they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his vi2lages in Israel: then sha2l the people of the LORD go down to the gates. 
Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, u2ter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam. 
Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty. 
Out of Ephraim was there a r2ot of them against Amalek; after th2e, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer. 
And the princes of I2sachar were with Deborah; even I2sachar, and also Barak: he was sent on f2ot into the va2ley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart. 
Why abodest thou among the sh2epfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart. 
Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches. 
Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field. 
The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Can2an in T2anach by the waters of Megi2do; they t2ok no gain of money. 
They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera. 
The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast tro2den down strength. 
Then were the horseh2ofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones. 
Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bi2terly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty. 
Ble2sed above women sha2l Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, ble2sed sha2l she be above women in the tent. 
He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth bu2ter in a lordly dish. 
She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's ha2mer; and with the ha2mer she smote Sisera, she smote o2f his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples. 
At her f2et he bowed, he fe2l, he lay down: at her f2et he bowed, he fe2l: where he bowed, there he fe2l down dead. 
The mother of Sisera l2oked out at a window, and cried through the la2tice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why ta2ry the wh2els of his chariots? 
Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself, 
Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of n2edlework, of divers colours of n2edlework on both sides, m2et for the necks of them that take the spoil? 
So let a2l thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years. 
And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years. 
And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds. 
And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them; 
And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, ti2l thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sh2ep, nor ox, nor a2s. 
For they came up with their ca2tle and their tents, and they came as gra2sho2pers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it. 
And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD. 
And it came to pa2s, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites, 
That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage; 
And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of a2l that o2pre2sed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land; 
And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwe2l: but ye have not obeyed my voice. 
And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepre2s, to hide it from the Midianites. 
And the angel of the LORD a2peared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD is with th2e, thou mighty man of valour. 
And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is a2l this befa2len us? and where be a2l his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites. 
And the LORD l2oked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent th2e? 
And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith sha2l I save Israel? behold, my family is p2or in Mana2seh, and I am the least in my father's house. 
And the LORD said unto him, Surely I wi2l be with th2e, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man. 
And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me. 
Depart not hence, I pray th2e, until I come unto th2e, and bring forth my present, and set it before th2e. And he said, I wi2l ta2ry until thou come again. 
And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it. 
And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so. 
Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the sta2f that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight. 
And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have s2en an angel of the LORD face to face. 
And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto th2e; fear not: thou shalt not die. 
Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and ca2led it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. 
And it came to pa2s the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father's young bu2lock, even the second bu2lock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of B2al that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it: 
And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bu2lock, and o2fer a burnt sacrifice with the w2od of the grove which thou shalt cut down. 
Then Gideon t2ok ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night. 
And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of B2al was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bu2lock was o2fered upon the altar that was built. 
And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing. 
Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of B2al, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it. 
And Joash said unto a2l that st2od against him, Wi2l ye plead for B2al? wi2l ye save him? he that wi2l plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar. 
Therefore on that day he ca2led him Jeru2b2al, saying, Let B2al plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar. 
Then a2l the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the va2ley of Jezr2el. 
But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him. 
And he sent me2sengers throughout a2l Mana2seh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent me2sengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to m2et them. 
And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said, 
Behold, I wi2l put a fl2ece of w2ol in the fl2or; and if the dew be on the fl2ece only, and it be dry upon a2l the earth beside, then sha2l I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said. 
And it was so: for he rose up early on the mo2row, and thrust the fl2ece together, and wringed the dew out of the fl2ece, a bowl fu2l of water. 
And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I wi2l speak but this once: let me prove, I pray th2e, but this once with the fl2ece; let it now be dry only upon the fl2ece, and upon a2l the ground let there be dew. 
And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fl2ece only, and there was dew on a2l the ground. 
Then Jeru2b2al, who is Gideon, and a2l the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the we2l of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hi2l of Moreh, in the va2ley. 
And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with th2e are t2o many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me. 
Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand. 
And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet t2o many; bring them down unto the water, and I wi2l try them for th2e there: and it sha2l be, that of whom I say unto th2e, This sha2l go with th2e, the same sha2l go with th2e; and of whomsoever I say unto th2e, This sha2l not go with th2e, the same sha2l not go. 
So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that la2peth of the water with his tongue, as a dog la2peth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his kn2es to drink. 
And the number of them that la2ped, pu2ting their hand to their mouth, were thr2e hundred men: but a2l the rest of the people bowed down upon their kn2es to drink water. 
And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the thr2e hundred men that la2ped wi2l I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let a2l the other people go every man unto his place. 
So the people t2ok victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent a2l the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those thr2e hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the va2ley. 
And it came to pa2s the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get th2e down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand. 
But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host: 
And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward sha2l thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host. 
And the Midianites and the Amalekites and a2l the children of the east lay along in the va2ley like gra2sho2pers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude. 
And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fe2low, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fe2l, and overturned it, that the tent lay along. 
And his fe2low answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and a2l the host. 
And it was so, when Gideon heard the te2ling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshi2ped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian. 
And he divided the thr2e hundred men into thr2e companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers. 
And he said unto them, L2ok on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it sha2l be that, as I do, so sha2l ye do. 
When I blow with a trumpet, I and a2l that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of a2l the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon. 
So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the begi2ning of the mi2dle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands. 
And the thr2e companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon. 
And they st2od every man in his place round about the camp; and a2l the host ran, and cried, and fled. 
And the thr2e hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fe2low, even throughout a2l the host: and the host fled to Bethshi2tah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Ta2bath. 
And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of a2l Mana2seh, and pursued after the Midianites. 
And Gideon sent me2sengers throughout a2l mount Ephraim, saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then a2l the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and t2ok the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. 
And they t2ok two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Z2eb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Z2eb they slew at the winepre2s of Z2eb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Z2eb to Gideon on the other side Jordan. 
And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou ca2ledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply. 
And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim be2ter than the vintage of Abiezer? 
God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Z2eb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that. 
And Gideon came to Jordan, and pa2sed over, he, and the thr2e hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them. 
And he said unto the men of Su2coth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that fo2low me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmu2na, kings of Midian. 
And the princes of Su2coth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmu2na now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army? 
And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmu2na into mine hand, then I wi2l tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderne2s and with briers. 
And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Su2coth had answered him. 
And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I wi2l break down this tower. 
Now Zebah and Zalmu2na were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fift2en thousand men, a2l that were left of a2l the hosts of the children of the east: for there fe2l an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword. 
And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure. 
And when Zebah and Zalmu2na fled, he pursued after them, and t2ok the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmu2na, and discomfited a2l the host. 
And Gideon the son of Joash returned from ba2tle before the sun was up, 
And caught a young man of the men of Su2coth, and enquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Su2coth, and the elders thereof, even thr2escore and sevent2en men. 
And he came unto the men of Su2coth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmu2na, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmu2na now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary? 
And he t2ok the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderne2s and briers, and with them he taught the men of Su2coth. 
And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city. 
Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmu2na, What ma2ner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king. 
And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you. 
And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth. 
Then Zebah and Zalmu2na said, Rise thou, and fa2l upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmu2na, and t2ok away the ornaments that were on their camels' necks. 
Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian. 
And Gideon said unto them, I wi2l not rule over you, neither sha2l my son rule over you: the LORD sha2l rule over you. 
And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the ea2rings of his prey. (For they had golden ea2rings, because they were Ishmaelites.) 
And they answered, We wi2l wi2lingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the ea2rings of his prey. 
And the weight of the golden ea2rings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and co2lars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels' necks. 
And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and a2l Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house. 
Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietne2s forty years in the days of Gideon. 
And Jeru2b2al the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house. 
And Gideon had thr2escore and ten sons of his body bego2ten: for he had many wives. 
And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he ca2led Abimelech. 
And Gideon the son of Joash died in a g2od old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. 
And it came to pa2s, as s2on as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after B2alim, and made B2alberith their god. 
And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of a2l their enemies on every side: 
Neither shewed they kindne2s to the house of Jeru2b2al, namely, Gideon, a2cording to a2l the g2odne2s which he had shewed unto Israel. 
And Abimelech the son of Jeru2b2al went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and co2muned with them, and with a2l the family of the house of his mother's father, saying, 
Speak, I pray you, in the ears of a2l the men of Shechem, Whether is be2ter for you, either that a2l the sons of Jeru2b2al, which are thr2escore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh. 
And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of a2l the men of Shechem a2l these words: and their hearts inclined to fo2low Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother. 
And they gave him thr2escore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of B2alberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which fo2lowed him. 
And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jeru2b2al, being thr2escore and ten persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jeru2b2al was left; for he hid himself. 
And a2l the men of Shechem gathered together, and a2l the house of Mi2lo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pi2lar that was in Shechem. 
And when they told it to Jotham, he went and st2od in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you. 
The tr2es went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tr2e, Reign thou over us. 
But the olive tr2e said unto them, Should I leave my fatne2s, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the tr2es? 
And the tr2es said to the fig tr2e, Come thou, and reign over us. 
But the fig tr2e said unto them, Should I forsake my sw2etne2s, and my g2od fruit, and go to be promoted over the tr2es? 
Then said the tr2es unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us. 
And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which ch2ereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the tr2es? 
Then said a2l the tr2es unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us. 
And the bramble said unto the tr2es, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon. 
Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt we2l with Jeru2b2al and his house, and have done unto him a2cording to the deserving of his hands; 
(For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian: 
And ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, thr2escore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;) 
If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jeru2b2al and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you: 
But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Mi2lo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Mi2lo, and devour Abimelech. 
And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to B2er, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother. 
When Abimelech had reigned thr2e years over Israel, 
Then God sent an evil spirit betw2en Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech: 
That the cruelty done to the thr2escore and ten sons of Jeru2b2al might come, and their bl2od be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the ki2ling of his brethren. 
And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they ro2bed a2l that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech. 
And G2al the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him. 
And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode the grapes, and made me2ry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech. 
And G2al the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jeru2b2al? and Zebul his o2ficer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him? 
And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out. 
And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of G2al the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled. 
And he sent me2sengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, G2al the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against th2e. 
Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with th2e, and lie in wait in the field: 
And it sha2l be, that in the morning, as s2on as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out against th2e, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find o2casion. 
And Abimelech rose up, and a2l the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies. 
And G2al the son of Ebed went out, and st2od in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait. 
And when G2al saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou s2est the shadow of the mountains as if they were men. 
And G2al spake again, and said, S2e there come people down by the mi2dle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim. 
Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them. 
And G2al went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech. 
And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the gate. 
And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out G2al and his brethren, that they should not dwe2l in Shechem. 
And it came to pa2s on the mo2row, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech. 
And he t2ok the people, and divided them into thr2e companies, and laid wait in the field, and l2oked, and, behold, the people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them. 
And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and st2od in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran upon a2l the people that were in the fields, and slew them. 
And Abimelech fought against the city a2l that day; and he t2ok the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt. 
And when a2l the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith. 
And it was told Abimelech, that a2l the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together. 
And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and a2l the people that were with him; and Abimelech t2ok an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the tr2es, and t2ok it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were with him, What ye have s2en me do, make haste, and do as I have done. 
And a2l the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and fo2lowed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that a2l the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women. 
Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and t2ok it. 
But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled a2l the men and women, and a2l they of the city, and shut it to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower. 
And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the d2or of the tower to burn it with fire. 
And a certain woman cast a piece of a mi2lstone upon Abimelech's head, and a2l to brake his sku2l. 
Then he ca2led hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died. 
And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place. 
Thus God rendered the wickedne2s of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren: 
And a2l the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jeru2b2al. 
And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of I2sachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim. 
And he judged Israel twenty and thr2e years, and died, and was buried in Shamir. 
And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years. 
And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty a2s colts, and they had thirty cities, which are ca2led Havothjair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead. 
And Jair died, and was buried in Camon. 
And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served B2alim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of A2mon, and the gods of the Philistines, and fors2ok the LORD, and served not him. 
And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of A2mon. 
And that year they vexed and o2pre2sed the children of Israel: eight2en years, a2l the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead. 
Moreover the children of A2mon pa2sed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distre2sed. 
And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have si2ned against th2e, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served B2alim. 
And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of A2mon, and from the Philistines? 
The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did o2pre2s you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand. 
Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I wi2l deliver you no more. 
Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation. 
And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have si2ned: do thou unto us whatsoever s2emeth g2od unto th2e; deliver us only, we pray th2e, this day. 
And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel. 
Then the children of A2mon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel a2sembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh. 
And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that wi2l begin to fight against the children of A2mon? he sha2l be head over a2l the inhabitants of Gilead. 
Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah. 
And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of a strange woman. 
Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him. 
And it came to pa2s in proce2s of time, that the children of A2mon made war against Israel. 
And it was so, that when the children of A2mon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob: 
And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of A2mon. 
And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distre2s? 
And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to th2e now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of A2mon, and be our head over a2l the inhabitants of Gilead. 
And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of A2mon, and the LORD deliver them before me, sha2l I be your head? 
And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witne2s betw2en us, if we do not so a2cording to thy words. 
Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah u2tered a2l his words before the LORD in Mizpeh. 
And Jephthah sent me2sengers unto the king of the children of A2mon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land? 
And the king of the children of A2mon answered unto the me2sengers of Jephthah, Because Israel t2ok away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Ja2bok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably. 
And Jephthah sent me2sengers again unto the king of the children of A2mon: 
And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel t2ok not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of A2mon: 
But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderne2s unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh; 
Then Israel sent me2sengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray th2e, pa2s through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto. And in like ma2ner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode in Kadesh. 
Then they went along through the wilderne2s, and compa2sed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab. 
And Israel sent me2sengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pa2s, we pray th2e, through thy land into my place. 
But Sihon trusted not Israel to pa2s through his coast: but Sihon gathered a2l his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel. 
And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and a2l his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel po2se2sed a2l the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country. 
And they po2se2sed a2l the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Ja2bok, and from the wilderne2s even unto Jordan. 
So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispo2se2sed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou po2se2s it? 
Wilt not thou po2se2s that which Chemosh thy god giveth th2e to po2se2s? So whomsoever the LORD our God sha2l drive out from before us, them wi2l we po2se2s. 
And now art thou any thing be2ter than Balak the son of Zi2por, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them, 
While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in a2l the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, thr2e hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover them within that time? 
Wherefore I have not si2ned against th2e, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day betw2en the children of Israel and the children of A2mon. 
Howbeit the king of the children of A2mon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him. 
Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he pa2sed over Gilead, and Mana2seh, and pa2sed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he pa2sed over unto the children of A2mon. 
And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of A2mon into mine hands, 
Then it sha2l be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the d2ors of my house to m2et me, when I return in peace from the children of A2mon, sha2l surely be the LORD's, and I wi2l o2fer it up for a burnt o2fering. 
So Jephthah pa2sed over unto the children of A2mon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands. 
And he smote them from Aroer, even ti2l thou come to Mi2nith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of A2mon were subdued before the children of Israel. 
And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to m2et him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter. 
And it came to pa2s, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I ca2not go back. 
And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me a2cording to that which hath proc2eded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for th2e of thine enemies, even of the children of A2mon. 
And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fe2lows. 
And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains. 
And it came to pa2s at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her a2cording to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel, 
That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year. 
And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore pa2sedst thou over to fight against the children of A2mon, and didst not ca2l us to go with th2e? we wi2l burn thine house upon th2e with fire. 
And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of A2mon; and when I ca2led you, ye delivered me not out of their hands. 
And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and pa2sed over against the children of A2mon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me? 
Then Jephthah gathered together a2l the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Mana2sites. 
And the Gileadites t2ok the pa2sages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay; 
Then said they unto him, Say now Shi2boleth: and he said Si2boleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they t2ok him, and slew him at the pa2sages of Jordan: and there fe2l at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand. 
And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead. 
And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. 
And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and t2ok in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years. 
Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem. 
And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years. 
And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun. 
And after him Abdon the son of Hi2lel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel. 
And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on thr2escore and ten a2s colts: and he judged Israel eight years. 
And Abdon the son of Hi2lel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites. 
And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years. 
And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was ba2ren, and bare not. 
And the angel of the LORD a2peared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art ba2ren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son. 
Now therefore beware, I pray th2e, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing: 
For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor sha2l come on his head: for the child sha2l be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he sha2l begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines. 
Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very te2rible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name: 
But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child sha2l be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death. 
Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we sha2l do unto the child that sha2l be born. 
And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her. 
And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath a2peared unto me, that came unto me the other day. 
And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am. 
And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pa2s. How sha2l we order the child, and how sha2l we do unto him? 
And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of a2l that I said unto the woman let her beware. 
She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: a2l that I co2manded her let her observe. 
And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray th2e, let us detain th2e, until we sha2l have made ready a kid for th2e. 
And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I wi2l not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt o2fer a burnt o2fering, thou must o2fer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD. 
And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pa2s we may do th2e honour? 
And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, s2eing it is secret? 
So Manoah t2ok a kid with a meat o2fering, and o2fered it upon a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wonderously; and Manoah and his wife l2oked on. 
For it came to pa2s, when the flame went up toward heaven from o2f the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife l2oked on it, and fe2l on their faces to the ground. 
But the angel of the LORD did no more a2pear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD. 
And Manoah said unto his wife, We sha2l surely die, because we have s2en God. 
But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to ki2l us, he would not have received a burnt o2fering and a meat o2fering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us a2l these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these. 
And the woman bare a son, and ca2led his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD ble2sed him. 
And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan betw2en Zorah and Eshtaol. 
And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines. 
And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have s2en a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife. 
Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among a2l my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me we2l. 
But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an o2casion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel. 
Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him. 
And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done. 
And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson we2l. 
And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to s2e the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of b2es and honey in the carcase of the lion. 
And he t2ok thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion. 
So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do. 
And it came to pa2s, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him. 
And Samson said unto them, I wi2l now put forth a ri2dle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I wi2l give you thirty sh2ets and thirty change of garments: 
But if ye ca2not declare it me, then sha2l ye give me thirty sh2ets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy ri2dle, that we may hear it. 
And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sw2etne2s. And they could not in thr2e days expound the ri2dle. 
And it came to pa2s on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the ri2dle, lest we burn th2e and thy father's house with fire: have ye ca2led us to take that we have? is it not so? 
And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a ri2dle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and sha2l I te2l it th2e? 
And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pa2s on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the ri2dle to the children of her people. 
And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sw2eter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion? and he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my ri2dle. 
And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and t2ok their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the ri2dle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house. 
But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend. 
But it came to pa2s within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I wi2l go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not su2fer him to go in. 
And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst u2terly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray th2e, instead of her. 
And Samson said concerning them, Now sha2l I be more blamele2s than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure. 
And Samson went and caught thr2e hundred foxes, and t2ok firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst betw2en two tails. 
And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives. 
Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire. 
And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet wi2l I be avenged of you, and after that I wi2l cease. 
And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam. 
Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi. 
And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us. 
Then thr2e thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them. 
And they said unto him, We are come down to bind th2e, that we may deliver th2e into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye wi2l not fa2l upon me yourselves. 
And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we wi2l bind th2e fast, and deliver th2e into their hand: but surely we wi2l not ki2l th2e. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock. 
And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands l2osed from o2f his hands. 
And he found a new jawbone of an a2s, and put forth his hand, and t2ok it, and slew a thousand men therewith. 
And Samson said, With the jawbone of an a2s, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an a2s have I slain a thousand men. 
And it came to pa2s, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and ca2led that place Ramathlehi. 
And he was sore athirst, and ca2led on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now sha2l I die for thirst, and fa2l into the hand of the uncircumcised? 
But God clave an ho2low place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore he ca2led the name thereof Enha2kore, which is in Lehi unto this day. 
And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years. 
Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her. 
And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compa2sed him in, and laid wait for him a2l night in the gate of the city, and were quiet a2l the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we sha2l ki2l him. 
And Samson lay ti2l midnight, and arose at midnight, and t2ok the d2ors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and a2l, and put them upon his shoulders, and ca2ried them up to the top of an hi2l that is before Hebron. 
And it came to pa2s afterward, that he loved a woman in the va2ley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. 
And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and s2e wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to a2flict him; and we wi2l give th2e every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver. 
And Delilah said to Samson, Te2l me, I pray th2e, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to a2flict th2e. 
And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven gr2en withs that were never dried, then sha2l I be weak, and be as another man. 
Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven gr2en withs which had not b2en dried, and she bound him with them. 
Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon th2e, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known. 
And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now te2l me, I pray th2e, wherewith thou mightest be bound. 
And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were o2cupied, then sha2l I be weak, and be as another man. 
Delilah therefore t2ok new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon th2e, Samson. And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from o2f his arms like a thread. 
And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: te2l me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web. 
And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon th2e, Samson. And he awaked out of his sl2ep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web. 
And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love th2e, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these thr2e times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth. 
And it came to pa2s, when she pre2sed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death; 
That he told her a2l his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have b2en a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength wi2l go from me, and I sha2l become weak, and be like any other man. 
And when Delilah saw that he had told her a2l his heart, she sent and ca2led for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me a2l his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand. 
And she made him sl2ep upon her kn2es; and she ca2led for a man, and she caused him to shave o2f the seven locks of his head; and she began to a2flict him, and his strength went from him. 
And she said, The Philistines be upon th2e, Samson. And he awoke out of his sl2ep, and said, I wi2l go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him. 
But the Philistines t2ok him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fe2ters of bra2s; and he did grind in the prison house. 
Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven. 
Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to o2fer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand. 
And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us. 
And it came to pa2s, when their hearts were me2ry, that they said, Ca2l for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they ca2led for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him betw2en the pi2lars. 
And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Su2fer me that I may f2el the pi2lars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them. 
Now the house was fu2l of men and women; and a2l the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the r2of about thr2e thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport. 
And Samson ca2led unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I pray th2e, and strengthen me, I pray th2e, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes. 
And Samson t2ok hold of the two mi2dle pi2lars upon which the house st2od, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left. 
And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with a2l his might; and the house fe2l upon the lords, and upon a2l the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life. 
Then his brethren and a2l the house of his father came down, and t2ok him, and brought him up, and buried him betw2en Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years. 
And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah. 
And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from th2e, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I t2ok it. And his mother said, Ble2sed be thou of the LORD, my son. 
And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had who2ly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I wi2l restore it unto th2e. 
Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother t2ok two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah. 
And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. 
In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes. 
And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there. 
And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed. 
And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place. 
And Micah said unto him, Dwe2l with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I wi2l give th2e ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of a2parel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in. 
And the Levite was content to dwe2l with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons. 
And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. 
Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD wi2l do me g2od, s2eing I have a Levite to my priest. 
In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwe2l in; for unto that day a2l their inheritance had not fa2len unto them among the tribes of Israel. 
And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there. 
When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought th2e hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast thou here? 
And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest. 
And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray th2e, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go sha2l be prosperous. 
And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your way wherein ye go. 
Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that were therein, how they dwelt carele2s, after the ma2ner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no busine2s with any man. 
And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What say ye? 
And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have s2en the land, and, behold, it is very g2od: and are ye sti2l? be not slothful to go, and to enter to po2se2s the land. 
When ye go, ye sha2l come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth. 
And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men a2pointed with weapons of war. 
And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: wherefore they ca2led that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, it is behind Kirjathjearim. 
And they pa2sed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah. 
Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do. 
And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him. 
And the six hundred men a2pointed with their weapons of war, which were of the children of Dan, st2od by the entering of the gate. 
And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in thither, and t2ok the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest st2od in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were a2pointed with weapons of war. 
And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What do ye? 
And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it be2ter for th2e to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel? 
And the priest's heart was glad, and he t2ok the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people. 
So they turned and departed, and put the li2tle ones and the ca2tle and the ca2riage before them. 
And when they were a g2od way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overt2ok the children of Dan. 
And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth th2e, that thou comest with such a company? 
And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth th2e? 
And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fe2lows run upon th2e, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household. 
And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were t2o strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house. 
And they t2ok the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire. 
And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no busine2s with any man; and it was in the va2ley that lieth by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein. 
And they ca2led the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first. 
And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Mana2seh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land. 
And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, a2l the time that the house of God was in Shiloh. 
And it came to pa2s in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who t2ok to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah. 
And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months. 
And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of a2ses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to m2et him. 
And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him thr2e days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there. 
And it came to pa2s on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way. 
And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray th2e, and ta2ry a2l night, and let thine heart be me2ry. 
And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again. 
And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray th2e. And they ta2ried until aftern2on, and they did eat both of them. 
And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you ta2ry a2l night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be me2ry; and to mo2row get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home. 
But the man would not ta2ry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him two a2ses sa2dled, his concubine also was with him. 
And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray th2e, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it. 
And his master said unto him, We wi2l not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we wi2l pa2s over to Gibeah. 
And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge a2l night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah. 
And they pa2sed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin. 
And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a str2et of the city: for there was no man that t2ok them into his house to lodging. 
And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites. 
And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the str2et of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou? 
And he said unto him, We are pa2sing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me to house. 
Yet there is both straw and provender for our a2ses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing. 
And the old man said, Peace be with th2e; howsoever let a2l thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the str2et. 
So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the a2ses: and they washed their f2et, and did eat and drink. 
Now as they were making their hearts me2ry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at the d2or, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him. 
And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; s2eing that this man is come into mine house, do not this fo2ly. 
Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I wi2l bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what s2emeth g2od unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing. 
But the men would not hearken to him: so the man t2ok his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her a2l the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go. 
Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fe2l down at the d2or of the man's house where her lord was, ti2l it was light. 
And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the d2ors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fa2len down at the d2or of the house, and her hands were upon the threshold. 
And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man t2ok her up upon an a2s, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place. 
And when he was come into his house, he t2ok a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into a2l the coasts of Israel. 
And it was so, that a2l that saw it said, There was no such d2ed done nor s2en from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds. 
Then a2l the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to B2ersheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh. 
And the chief of a2l the people, even of a2l the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the a2sembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand f2otmen that drew sword. 
(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Te2l us, how was this wickedne2s? 
And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge. 
And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead. 
And I t2ok my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout a2l the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have co2mi2ted lewdne2s and fo2ly in Israel. 
Behold, ye are a2l children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel. 
And a2l the people arose as one man, saying, We wi2l not any of us go to his tent, neither wi2l we any of us turn into his house. 
But now this sha2l be the thing which we wi2l do to Gibeah; we wi2l go up by lot against it; 
And we wi2l take ten men of an hundred throughout a2l the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, a2cording to a2l the fo2ly that they have wrought in Israel. 
So a2l the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man. 
And the tribes of Israel sent men through a2l the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedne2s is this that is done among you? 
Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel. 
But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to ba2tle against the children of Israel. 
And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men. 
Among a2l this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not mi2s. 
And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: a2l these were men of war. 
And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us sha2l go up first to the ba2tle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah sha2l go up first. 
And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah. 
And the men of Israel went out to ba2tle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in a2ray to fight against them at Gibeah. 
And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men. 
And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their ba2tle again in a2ray in the place where they put themselves in a2ray the first day. 
(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Sha2l I go up again to ba2tle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.) 
And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day. 
And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eight2en thousand men; a2l these drew the sword. 
Then a2l the children of Israel, and a2l the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and o2fered burnt o2ferings and peace o2ferings before the LORD. 
And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days, 
And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, st2od before it in those days,) saying, Sha2l I yet again go out to ba2tle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or sha2l I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to mo2row I wi2l deliver them into thine hand. 
And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah. 
And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in a2ray against Gibeah, as at other times. 
And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and ki2l, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel. 
And the children of Benjamin said, They are smi2ten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us fl2e, and draw them from the city unto the highways. 
And a2l the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in a2ray at B2altamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah. 
And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of a2l Israel, and the ba2tle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near them. 
And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: a2l these drew the sword. 
So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smi2ten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah. 
And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote a2l the city with the edge of the sword. 
Now there was an a2pointed sign betw2en the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city. 
And when the men of Israel retired in the ba2tle, Benjamin began to smite and ki2l of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smi2ten down before us, as in the first ba2tle. 
But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pi2lar of smoke, the Benjamites l2oked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven. 
And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them. 
Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderne2s; but the ba2tle overt2ok them; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them. 
Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising. 
And there fe2l of Benjamin eight2en thousand men; a2l these were men of valour. 
And they turned and fled toward the wilderne2s unto the rock of Ri2mon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them. 
So that a2l which fe2l that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; a2l these were men of valour. 
But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderne2s unto the rock Ri2mon, and abode in the rock Ri2mon four months. 
And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as we2l the men of every city, as the beast, and a2l that came to hand: also they set on fire a2l the cities that they came to. 
Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There sha2l not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife. 
And the people came to the house of God, and abode there ti2l even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore; 
And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pa2s in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel? 
And it came to pa2s on the mo2row, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and o2fered burnt o2ferings and peace o2ferings. 
And the children of Israel said, Who is there among a2l the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He sha2l surely be put to death. 
And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut o2f from Israel this day. 
How sha2l we do for wives for them that remain, s2eing we have sworn by the LORD that we wi2l not give them of our daughters to wives? 
And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the a2sembly. 
For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there. 
And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and co2manded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children. 
And this is the thing that ye sha2l do, Ye sha2l u2terly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man. 
And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Can2an. 
And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Ri2mon, and to ca2l peaceably unto them. 
And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they su2ficed them not. 
And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel. 
Then the elders of the congregation said, How sha2l we do for wives for them that remain, s2eing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin? 
And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel. 
Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin. 
Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah. 
Therefore they co2manded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards; 
And s2e, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin. 
And it sha2l be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we wi2l say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty. 
And the children of Benjamin did so, and t2ok them wives, a2cording to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them. 
And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance. 
In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes. 
Now it came to pa2s in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons. 
And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there. 
And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons. 
And they t2ok them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwe2led there about ten years. 
And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband. 
Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread. 
Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah. 
And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me. 
The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she ki2sed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept. 
And they said unto her, Surely we wi2l return with th2e unto thy people. 
And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why wi2l ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands? 
Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am t2o old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons; 
Would ye ta2ry for them ti2l they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me. 
And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah ki2sed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her. 
And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law. 
And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave th2e, or to return from fo2lowing after th2e: for whither thou goest, I wi2l go; and where thou lodgest, I wi2l lodge: thy people sha2l be my people, and thy God my God: 
Where thou diest, wi2l I die, and there wi2l I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part th2e and me. 
When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her. 
So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pa2s, when they were come to Bethlehem, that a2l the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi? 
And she said unto them, Ca2l me not Naomi, ca2l me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bi2terly with me. 
I went out fu2l and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then ca2l ye me Naomi, s2eing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath a2flicted me? 
So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabite2s, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the begi2ning of barley harvest. 
And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz. 
And Ruth the Moabite2s said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I sha2l find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter. 
And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech. 
And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD ble2s th2e. 
Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this? 
And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab: 
And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she ta2ried a li2tle in the house. 
Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens: 
Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they sha2l not touch th2e? and when thou art athirst, go unto the ve2sels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn. 
Then she fe2l on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, s2eing I am a stranger? 
And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fu2ly b2en shewed me, a2l that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore. 
The LORD recompense thy work, and a fu2l reward be given th2e of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust. 
Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens. 
And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was su2ficed, and left. 
And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz co2manded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not: 
And let fa2l also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not. 
So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley. 
And she t2ok it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was su2ficed. 
And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? ble2sed be he that did take knowledge of th2e. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz. 
And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Ble2sed be he of the LORD, who hath not left o2f his kindne2s to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen. 
And Ruth the Moabite2s said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt k2ep fast by my young men, until they have ended a2l my harvest. 
And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is g2od, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they m2et th2e not in any other field. 
So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law. 
Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, sha2l I not s2ek rest for th2e, that it may be we2l with th2e? 
And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he wi2noweth barley to night in the threshingfl2or. 
Wash thyself therefore, and anoint th2e, and put thy raiment upon th2e, and get th2e down to the fl2or: but make not thyself known unto the man, until he sha2l have done eating and drinking. 
And it sha2l be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he sha2l lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his f2et, and lay th2e down; and he wi2l te2l th2e what thou shalt do. 
And she said unto her, A2l that thou sayest unto me I wi2l do. 
And she went down unto the fl2or, and did a2cording to a2l that her mother in law bade her. 
And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was me2ry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his f2et, and laid her down. 
And it came to pa2s at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his f2et. 
And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman. 
And he said, Ble2sed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou hast shewed more kindne2s in the la2ter end than at the begi2ning, inasmuch as thou fo2lowedst not young men, whether p2or or rich. 
And now, my daughter, fear not; I wi2l do to th2e a2l that thou requirest: for a2l the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman. 
And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I. 
Ta2ry this night, and it sha2l be in the morning, that if he wi2l perform unto th2e the part of a kinsman, we2l; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he wi2l not do the part of a kinsman to th2e, then wi2l I do the part of a kinsman to th2e, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning. 
And she lay at his f2et until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the fl2or. 
Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon th2e, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city. 
And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her a2l that the man had done to her. 
And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law. 
Then said she, Sit sti2l, my daughter, until thou know how the ma2ter wi2l fa2l: for the man wi2l not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day. 
Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down. 
And he t2ok ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down. 
And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, se2leth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's: 
And I thought to advertise th2e, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt red2em it, red2em it: but if thou wilt not red2em it, then te2l me, that I may know: for there is none to red2em it beside th2e; and I am after th2e. And he said, I wi2l red2em it. 
Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabite2s, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance. 
And the kinsman said, I ca2not red2em it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: red2em thou my right to thyself; for I ca2not red2em it. 
Now this was the ma2ner in former time in Israel concerning red2eming and concerning changing, for to confirm a2l things; a man plucked o2f his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel. 
Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for th2e. So he drew o2f his shoe. 
And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto a2l the people, Ye are witne2ses this day, that I have bought a2l that was Elimelech's, and a2l that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi. 
Moreover Ruth the Moabite2s, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut o2f from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witne2ses this day. 
And a2l the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witne2ses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem: 
And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the s2ed which the LORD sha2l give th2e of this young woman. 
So Boaz t2ok Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son. 
And the women said unto Naomi, Ble2sed be the LORD, which hath not left th2e this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel. 
And he sha2l be unto th2e a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth th2e, which is be2ter to th2e than seven sons, hath born him. 
And Naomi t2ok the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it. 
And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they ca2led his name Obed: he is the father of Je2se, the father of David. 
Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron, 
And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat A2minadab, 
And A2minadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon, 
And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed, 
And Obed begat Je2se, and Je2se begat David. 
Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: 
And he had two wives; the name of the one was Ha2nah, and the name of the other Peni2nah: and Peni2nah had children, but Ha2nah had no children. 
And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there. 
And when the time was that Elkanah o2fered, he gave to Peni2nah his wife, and to a2l her sons and her daughters, portions: 
But unto Ha2nah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Ha2nah: but the LORD had shut up her womb. 
And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb. 
And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat. 
Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Ha2nah, why w2epest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I be2ter to th2e than ten sons? 
So Ha2nah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD. 
And she was in bi2terne2s of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore. 
And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt ind2ed l2ok on the a2fliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I wi2l give him unto the LORD a2l the days of his life, and there sha2l no razor come upon his head. 
And it came to pa2s, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth. 
Now Ha2nah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had b2en drunken. 
And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from th2e. 
And Ha2nah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a so2rowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD. 
Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto. 
Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant th2e thy petition that thou hast asked of him. 
And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad. 
And they rose up in the morning early, and worshi2ped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Ha2nah his wife; and the LORD remembered her. 
Wherefore it came to pa2s, when the time was come about after Ha2nah had conceived, that she bare a son, and ca2led his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD. 
And the man Elkanah, and a2l his house, went up to o2fer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow. 
But Ha2nah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I wi2l not go up until the child be weaned, and then I wi2l bring him, that he may a2pear before the LORD, and there abide for ever. 
And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what s2emeth th2e g2od; ta2ry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him. 
And when she had weaned him, she t2ok him up with her, with thr2e bu2locks, and one ephah of flour, and a bo2tle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young. 
And they slew a bu2lock, and brought the child to Eli. 
And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that st2od by th2e here, praying unto the LORD. 
For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him: 
Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he sha2l be lent to the LORD. And he worshi2ped the LORD there. 
And Ha2nah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation. 
There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside th2e: neither is there any rock like our God. 
Talk no more so exc2eding proudly; let not a2rogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed. 
The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength. 
They that were fu2l have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the ba2ren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed f2eble. 
The LORD ki2leth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up. 
The LORD maketh p2or, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up. 
He raiseth up the p2or out of the dust, and lifteth up the be2gar from the dunghi2l, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pi2lars of the earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them. 
He wi2l k2ep the f2et of his saints, and the wicked sha2l be silent in darkne2s; for by strength sha2l no man prevail. 
The adversaries of the LORD sha2l be broken to pieces; out of heaven sha2l he thunder upon them: the LORD sha2l judge the ends of the earth; and he sha2l give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed. 
And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest. 
Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD. 
And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man o2fered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in s2ething, with a fles2h2ok of thr2e t2eth in his hand; 
And he struck it into the pan, or ke2tle, or caldron, or pot; a2l that the fles2h2ok brought up the priest t2ok for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto a2l the Israelites that came thither. 
Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he wi2l not have so2den flesh of th2e, but raw. 
And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I wi2l take it by force. 
Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abho2red the o2fering of the LORD. 
But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod. 
Moreover his mother made him a li2tle coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to o2fer the yearly sacrifice. 
And Eli ble2sed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give th2e s2ed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home. 
And the LORD visited Ha2nah, so that she conceived, and bare thr2e sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD. 
Now Eli was very old, and heard a2l that his sons did unto a2l Israel; and how they lay with the women that a2sembled at the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by a2l this people. 
Nay, my sons; for it is no g2od report that I hear: ye make the LORD's people to transgre2s. 
If one man sin against another, the judge sha2l judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who sha2l intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them. 
And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men. 
And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly a2pear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house? 
And did I ch2ose him out of a2l the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to o2fer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father a2l the o2ferings made by fire of the children of Israel? 
Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine o2fering, which I have co2manded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of a2l the o2ferings of Israel my people? 
Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said ind2ed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I wi2l honour, and they that despise me sha2l be lightly est2emed. 
Behold, the days come, that I wi2l cut o2f thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there sha2l not be an old man in thine house. 
And thou shalt s2e an enemy in my habitation, in a2l the wealth which God sha2l give Israel: and there sha2l not be an old man in thine house for ever. 
And the man of thine, whom I sha2l not cut o2f from mine altar, sha2l be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and a2l the increase of thine house sha2l die in the flower of their age. 
And this sha2l be a sign unto th2e, that sha2l come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they sha2l die both of them. 
And I wi2l raise me up a faithful priest, that sha2l do a2cording to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I wi2l build him a sure house; and he sha2l walk before mine anointed for ever. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that every one that is left in thine house sha2l come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and sha2l say, Put me, I pray th2e, into one of the priests' o2fices, that I may eat a piece of bread. 
And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision. 
And it came to pa2s at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not s2e; 
And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sl2ep; 
That the LORD ca2led Samuel: and he answered, Here am I. 
And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou ca2ledst me. And he said, I ca2led not; lie down again. And he went and lay down. 
And the LORD ca2led yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst ca2l me. And he answered, I ca2led not, my son; lie down again. 
Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him. 
And the LORD ca2led Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst ca2l me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had ca2led the child. 
Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it sha2l be, if he ca2l th2e, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. 
And the LORD came, and st2od, and ca2led as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth. 
And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I wi2l do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it sha2l tingle. 
In that day I wi2l perform against Eli a2l things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I wi2l also make an end. 
For I have told him that I wi2l judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not. 
And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house sha2l not be purged with sacrifice nor o2fering for ever. 
And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the d2ors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision. 
Then Eli ca2led Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I. 
And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto th2e? I pray th2e hide it not from me: God do so to th2e, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of a2l the things that he said unto th2e. 
And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what s2emeth him g2od. 
And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fa2l to the ground. 
And a2l Israel from Dan even to B2ersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD. 
And the LORD a2peared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD. 
And the word of Samuel came to a2l Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to ba2tle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek. 
And the Philistines put themselves in a2ray against Israel: and when they joined ba2tle, Israel was smi2ten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men. 
And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smi2ten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies. 
So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwe2leth betw2en the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God. 
And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, a2l Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again. 
And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they underst2od that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp. 
And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not b2en such a thing heretofore. 
Woe unto us! who sha2l deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with a2l the plagues in the wilderne2s. 
Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have b2en to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight. 
And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smi2ten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fe2l of Israel thirty thousand f2otmen. 
And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain. 
And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head. 
And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, a2l the city cried out. 
And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli. 
Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not s2e. 
And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son? 
And the me2senger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath b2en also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken. 
And it came to pa2s, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fe2l from o2f the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years. 
And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her. 
And about the time of her death the women that st2od by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard it. 
And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband. 
And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken. 
And the Philistines t2ok the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod. 
When the Philistines t2ok the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon. 
And when they of Ashdod arose early on the mo2row, behold, Dagon was fa2len upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they t2ok Dagon, and set him in his place again. 
And when they arose early on the mo2row morning, behold, Dagon was fa2len upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut o2f upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him. 
Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day. 
But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof. 
And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel sha2l not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god. 
They sent therefore and gathered a2l the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What sha2l we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be ca2ried about unto Gath. And they ca2ried the ark of the God of Israel about thither. 
And it was so, that, after they had ca2ried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both sma2l and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts. 
Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pa2s, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people. 
So they sent and gathered together a2l the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout a2l the city; the hand of God was very heavy there. 
And the men that died not were smi2ten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven. 
And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months. 
And the Philistines ca2led for the priests and the diviners, saying, What sha2l we do to the ark of the LORD? te2l us wherewith we sha2l send it to his place. 
And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespa2s o2fering: then ye sha2l be healed, and it sha2l be known to you why his hand is not removed from you. 
Then said they, What sha2l be the trespa2s o2fering which we sha2l return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, a2cording to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you a2l, and on your lords. 
Wherefore ye sha2l make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye sha2l give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he wi2l lighten his hand from o2f you, and from o2f your gods, and from o2f your land. 
Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfu2ly among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed? 
Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them: 
And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespa2s o2fering, in a co2fer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go. 
And s2e, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we sha2l know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that ha2pened to us. 
And the men did so; and t2ok two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home: 
And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the co2fer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods. 
And the kine t2ok the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh. 
And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the va2ley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to s2e it. 
And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and st2od there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the w2od of the cart, and o2fered the kine a burnt o2fering unto the LORD. 
And the Levites t2ok down the ark of the LORD, and the co2fer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh o2fered burnt o2ferings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD. 
And when the five lords of the Philistines had s2en it, they returned to Ekron the same day. 
And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a trespa2s o2fering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one; 
And the golden mice, a2cording to the number of a2l the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced cities, and of country vi2lages, even unto the great stone of Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite. 
And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had l2oked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and thr2escore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smi2ten many of the people with a great slaughter. 
And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom sha2l he go up from us? 
And they sent me2sengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you. 
And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hi2l, and sanctified Eleazar his son to k2ep the ark of the LORD. 
And it came to pa2s, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and a2l the house of Israel lamented after the LORD. 
And Samuel spake unto a2l the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the LORD with a2l your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he wi2l deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines. 
Then the children of Israel did put away B2alim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only. 
And Samuel said, Gather a2l Israel to Mizpeh, and I wi2l pray for you unto the LORD. 
And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have si2ned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh. 
And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines. 
And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he wi2l save us out of the hand of the Philistines. 
And Samuel t2ok a sucking lamb, and o2fered it for a burnt o2fering who2ly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him. 
And as Samuel was o2fering up the burnt o2fering, the Philistines drew near to ba2tle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smi2ten before Israel. 
And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar. 
Then Samuel t2ok a stone, and set it betw2en Mizpeh and Shen, and ca2led the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us. 
So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines a2l the days of Samuel. 
And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace betw2en Israel and the Amorites. 
And Samuel judged Israel a2l the days of his life. 
And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in a2l those places. 
And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD. 
And it came to pa2s, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel. 
Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in B2ersheba. 
And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and t2ok bribes, and perverted judgment. 
Then a2l the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah, 
And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like a2l the nations. 
But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD. 
And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in a2l that they say unto th2e: for they have not rejected th2e, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them. 
A2cording to a2l the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto th2e. 
Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the ma2ner of the king that sha2l reign over them. 
And Samuel told a2l the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king. 
And he said, This wi2l be the ma2ner of the king that sha2l reign over you: He wi2l take your sons, and a2point them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some sha2l run before his chariots. 
And he wi2l a2point him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and wi2l set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots. 
And he wi2l take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be c2oks, and to be bakers. 
And he wi2l take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. 
And he wi2l take the tenth of your s2ed, and of your vineyards, and give to his o2ficers, and to his servants. 
And he wi2l take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your g2odliest young men, and your a2ses, and put them to his work. 
He wi2l take the tenth of your sh2ep: and ye sha2l be his servants. 
And ye sha2l cry out in that day because of your king which ye sha2l have chosen you; and the LORD wi2l not hear you in that day. 
Neverthele2s the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we wi2l have a king over us; 
That we also may be like a2l the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our ba2tles. 
And Samuel heard a2l the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD. 
And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city. 
Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power. 
And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a g2odly: and there was not among the children of Israel a g2odlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people. 
And the a2ses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with th2e, and arise, go s2ek the a2ses. 
And he pa2sed through mount Ephraim, and pa2sed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they pa2sed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he pa2sed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not. 
And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the a2ses, and take thought for us. 
And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; a2l that he saith cometh surely to pa2s: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go. 
Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what sha2l we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our ve2sels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we? 
And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that wi2l I give to the man of God, to te2l us our way. 
(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the s2er: for he that is now ca2led a Prophet was beforetime ca2led a S2er.) 
Then said Saul to his servant, We2l said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was. 
And as they went up the hi2l to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the s2er here? 
And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place: 
As s2on as ye be come into the city, ye sha2l straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people wi2l not eat until he come, because he doth ble2s the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bi2den. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye sha2l find him. 
And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place. 
Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying, 
To mo2row about this time I wi2l send th2e a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have l2oked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me. 
And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to th2e of! this same sha2l reign over my people. 
Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Te2l me, I pray th2e, where the s2er's house is. 
And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the s2er: go up before me unto the high place; for ye sha2l eat with me to day, and to mo2row I wi2l let th2e go, and wi2l te2l th2e a2l that is in thine heart. 
And as for thine a2ses that were lost thr2e days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is a2l the desire of Israel? Is it not on th2e, and on a2l thy father's house? 
And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the sma2lest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of a2l the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me? 
And Samuel t2ok Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bi2den, which were about thirty persons. 
And Samuel said unto the c2ok, Bring the portion which I gave th2e, of which I said unto th2e, Set it by th2e. 
And the c2ok t2ok up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before th2e, and eat: for unto this time hath it b2en kept for th2e since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day. 
And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel co2muned with Saul upon the top of the house. 
And they arose early: and it came to pa2s about the spring of the day, that Samuel ca2led Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send th2e away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad. 
And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pa2s on before us, (and he pa2sed on), but stand thou sti2l a while, that I may shew th2e the word of God. 
Then Samuel t2ok a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and ki2sed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed th2e to be captain over his inheritance? 
When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they wi2l say unto th2e, The a2ses which thou wentest to s2ek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the a2ses, and so2roweth for you, saying, What sha2l I do for my son? 
Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there sha2l m2et th2e thr2e men going up to God to Bethel, one ca2rying thr2e kids, and another ca2rying thr2e loaves of bread, and another ca2rying a bo2tle of wine: 
And they wi2l salute th2e, and give th2e two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands. 
After that thou shalt come to the hi2l of God, where is the ga2rison of the Philistines: and it sha2l come to pa2s, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt m2et a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they sha2l prophesy: 
And the Spirit of the LORD wi2l come upon th2e, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man. 
And let it be, when these signs are come unto th2e, that thou do as o2casion serve th2e; for God is with th2e. 
And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I wi2l come down unto th2e, to o2fer burnt o2ferings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace o2ferings: seven days shalt thou ta2ry, ti2l I come to th2e, and shew th2e what thou shalt do. 
And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and a2l those signs came to pa2s that day. 
And when they came thither to the hi2l, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them. 
And it came to pa2s, when a2l that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets? 
And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets? 
And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place. 
And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To s2ek the a2ses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel. 
And Saul's uncle said, Te2l me, I pray th2e, what Samuel said unto you. 
And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the a2ses were found. But of the ma2ter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not. 
And Samuel ca2led the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh; 
And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of a2l kingdoms, and of them that o2pre2sed you: 
And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of a2l your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands. 
And when Samuel had caused a2l the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken. 
When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found. 
Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold he hath hid himself among the stu2f. 
And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he st2od among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward. 
And Samuel said to a2l the people, S2e ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among a2l the people? And a2l the people shouted, and said, God save the king. 
Then Samuel told the people the ma2ner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a b2ok, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent a2l the people away, every man to his house. 
And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched. 
But the children of Belial said, How sha2l this man save us? And they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held his peace. 
Then Nahash the A2monite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and a2l the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we wi2l serve th2e. 
And Nahash the A2monite answered them, On this condition wi2l I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out a2l your right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon a2l Israel. 
And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send me2sengers unto a2l the coasts of Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we wi2l come out to th2e. 
Then came the me2sengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and a2l the people lifted up their voices, and wept. 
And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What aileth the people that they w2ep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh. 
And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly. 
And he t2ok a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout a2l the coasts of Israel by the hands of me2sengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so sha2l it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fe2l on the people, and they came out with one consent. 
And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were thr2e hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand. 
And they said unto the me2sengers that came, Thus sha2l ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To mo2row, by that time the sun be hot, ye sha2l have help. And the me2sengers came and shewed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad. 
Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To mo2row we wi2l come out unto you, and ye sha2l do with us a2l that s2emeth g2od unto you. 
And it was so on the mo2row, that Saul put the people in thr2e companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the A2monites until the heat of the day: and it came to pa2s, that they which remained were sca2tered, so that two of them were not left together. 
And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Sha2l Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death. 
And Saul said, There sha2l not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel. 
Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there. 
And a2l the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace o2ferings before the LORD; and there Saul and a2l the men of Israel rejoiced greatly. 
And Samuel said unto a2l Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in a2l that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you. 
And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childh2od unto this day. 
Behold, here I am: witne2s against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose a2s have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I o2pre2sed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I wi2l restore it you. 
And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor o2pre2sed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand. 
And he said unto them, The LORD is witne2s against you, and his anointed is witne2s this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, He is witne2s. 
And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt. 
Now therefore stand sti2l, that I may reason with you before the LORD of a2l the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers. 
When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwe2l in this place. 
And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them. 
And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have si2ned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served B2alim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we wi2l serve th2e. 
And the LORD sent Jeru2b2al, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwe2led safe. 
And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of A2mon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king sha2l reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king. 
Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you. 
If ye wi2l fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the co2mandment of the LORD, then sha2l both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue fo2lowing the LORD your God: 
But if ye wi2l not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the co2mandment of the LORD, then sha2l the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers. 
Now therefore stand and s2e this great thing, which the LORD wi2l do before your eyes. 
Is it not wheat harvest to day? I wi2l ca2l unto the LORD, and he sha2l send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and s2e that your wickedne2s is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king. 
So Samuel ca2led unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and a2l the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel. 
And a2l the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have a2ded unto a2l our sins this evil, to ask us a king. 
And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done a2l this wickedne2s: yet turn not aside from fo2lowing the LORD, but serve the LORD with a2l your heart; 
And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which ca2not profit nor deliver; for they are vain. 
For the LORD wi2l not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people. 
Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I wi2l teach you the g2od and the right way: 
Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with a2l your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you. 
But if ye sha2l sti2l do wickedly, ye sha2l be consumed, both ye and your king. 
Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel, 
Saul chose him thr2e thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent. 
And Jonathan smote the ga2rison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout a2l the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear. 
And a2l Israel heard say that Saul had smi2ten a ga2rison of the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were ca2led together after Saul to Gilgal. 
And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven. 
When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distre2sed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits. 
And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and a2l the people fo2lowed him trembling. 
And he ta2ried seven days, a2cording to the set time that Samuel had a2pointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were sca2tered from him. 
And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt o2fering to me, and peace o2ferings. And he o2fered the burnt o2fering. 
And it came to pa2s, that as s2on as he had made an end of o2fering the burnt o2fering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to m2et him, that he might salute him. 
And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were sca2tered from me, and that thou camest not within the days a2pointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash; 
Therefore said I, The Philistines wi2l come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made su2plication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and o2fered a burnt o2fering. 
And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done f2olishly: thou hast not kept the co2mandment of the LORD thy God, which he co2manded th2e: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever. 
But now thy kingdom sha2l not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath co2manded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD co2manded th2e. 
And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men. 
And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash. 
And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in thr2e companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual: 
And another company turned the way to Bet2horon: and another company turned to the way of the border that l2oketh to the va2ley of Zeboim toward the wilderne2s. 
Now there was no smith found throughout a2l the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears: 
But a2l the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his ma2tock. 
Yet they had a file for the ma2tocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads. 
So it came to pa2s in the day of ba2tle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found. 
And the ga2rison of the Philistines went out to the pa2sage of Michmash. 
Now it came to pa2s upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' ga2rison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father. 
And Saul ta2ried in the u2termost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tr2e which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about six hundred men; 
And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone. 
And betw2en the pa2sages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' ga2rison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. 
The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah. 
And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the ga2rison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD wi2l work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few. 
And his armourbearer said unto him, Do a2l that is in thine heart: turn th2e; behold, I am with th2e a2cording to thy heart. 
Then said Jonathan, Behold, we wi2l pa2s over unto these men, and we wi2l discover ourselves unto them. 
If they say thus unto us, Ta2ry until we come to you; then we wi2l stand sti2l in our place, and wi2l not go up unto them. 
But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we wi2l go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this sha2l be a sign unto us. 
And both of them discovered themselves unto the ga2rison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves. 
And the men of the ga2rison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we wi2l shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel. 
And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his f2et, and his armourbearer after him: and they fe2l before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him. 
And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow. 
And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among a2l the people: the ga2rison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling. 
And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin l2oked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another. 
Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and s2e who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there. 
And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel. 
And it came to pa2s, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand. 
And Saul and a2l the people that were with him a2sembled themselves, and they came to the ba2tle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fe2low, and there was a very great discomfiture. 
Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan. 
Likewise a2l the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also fo2lowed hard after them in the ba2tle. 
So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the ba2tle pa2sed over unto Bethaven. 
And the men of Israel were distre2sed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any f2od until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any f2od. 
And a2l they of the land came to a w2od; and there was honey upon the ground. 
And when the people were come into the w2od, behold, the honey dro2ped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath. 
But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and di2ped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened. 
Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any f2od this day. And the people were faint. 
Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: s2e, I pray you, how mine eyes have b2en enlightened, because I tasted a li2tle of this honey. 
How much more, if haply the people had eaten fr2ely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not b2en now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines? 
And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint. 
And the people flew upon the spoil, and t2ok sh2ep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the bl2od. 
Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the bl2od. And he said, Ye have transgre2sed: ro2l a great stone unto me this day. 
And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sh2ep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the bl2od. And a2l the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there. 
And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD. 
And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever s2emeth g2od unto th2e. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God. 
And Saul asked counsel of God, Sha2l I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day. 
And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, a2l the chief of the people: and know and s2e wherein this sin hath b2en this day. 
For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he sha2l surely die. But there was not a man among a2l the people that answered him. 
Then said he unto a2l Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son wi2l be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what s2emeth g2od unto th2e. 
Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped. 
And Saul said, Cast lots betw2en me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken. 
Then Saul said to Jonathan, Te2l me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a li2tle honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die. 
And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan. 
And the people said unto Saul, Sha2l Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there sha2l not one hair of his head fa2l to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not. 
Then Saul went up from fo2lowing the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place. 
So Saul t2ok the kingdom over Israel, and fought against a2l his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of A2mon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them. 
And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them. 
Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal: 
And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahim2az: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle. 
And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel. 
And there was sore war against the Philistines a2l the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he t2ok him unto him. 
Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint th2e to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD. 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt. 
Now go and smite Amalek, and u2terly destroy a2l that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sh2ep, camel and a2s. 
And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand f2otmen, and ten thousand men of Judah. 
And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the va2ley. 
And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindne2s to a2l the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. 
And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt. 
And he t2ok Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and u2terly destroyed a2l the people with the edge of the sword. 
But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sh2ep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and a2l that was g2od, and would not u2terly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed u2terly. 
Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying, 
It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from fo2lowing me, and hath not performed my co2mandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD a2l night. 
And when Samuel rose early to m2et Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and pa2sed on, and gone down to Gilgal. 
And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Ble2sed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the co2mandment of the LORD. 
And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sh2ep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear? 
And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sh2ep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have u2terly destroyed. 
Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I wi2l te2l th2e what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on. 
And Samuel said, When thou wast li2tle in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed th2e king over Israel? 
And the LORD sent th2e on a journey, and said, Go and u2terly destroy the si2ners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed. 
Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD? 
And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have u2terly destroyed the Amalekites. 
But the people t2ok of the spoil, sh2ep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have b2en u2terly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal. 
And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt o2ferings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is be2ter than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. 
For rebe2lion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stu2bor2ne2s is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected th2e from being king. 
And Saul said unto Samuel, I have si2ned: for I have transgre2sed the co2mandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice. 
Now therefore, I pray th2e, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD. 
And Samuel said unto Saul, I wi2l not return with th2e: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected th2e from being king over Israel. 
And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent. 
And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from th2e this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is be2ter than thou. 
And also the Strength of Israel wi2l not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent. 
Then he said, I have si2ned: yet honour me now, I pray th2e, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God. 
So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshi2ped the LORD. 
Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bi2terne2s of death is past. 
And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women childle2s, so sha2l thy mother be childle2s among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal. 
Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul. 
And Samuel came no more to s2e Saul until the day of his death: neverthele2s Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel. 
And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, s2eing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fi2l thine horn with oil, and go, I wi2l send th2e to Je2se the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons. 
And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he wi2l ki2l me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with th2e, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD. 
And ca2l Je2se to the sacrifice, and I wi2l shew th2e what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto th2e. 
And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably? 
And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Je2se and his sons, and ca2led them to the sacrifice. 
And it came to pa2s, when they were come, that he l2oked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him. 
But the LORD said unto Samuel, L2ok not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD s2eth not as man s2eth; for man l2oketh on the outward a2pearance, but the LORD l2oketh on the heart. 
Then Je2se ca2led Abinadab, and made him pa2s before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this. 
Then Je2se made Sha2mah to pa2s by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this. 
Again, Je2se made seven of his sons to pa2s before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Je2se, The LORD hath not chosen these. 
And Samuel said unto Je2se, Are here a2l thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he k2epeth the sh2ep. And Samuel said unto Je2se, Send and fetch him: for we wi2l not sit down ti2l he come hither. 
And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ru2dy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and g2odly to l2ok to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he. 
Then Samuel t2ok the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah. 
But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him. 
And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth th2e. 
Let our lord now co2mand thy servants, which are before th2e, to s2ek out a man, who is a cu2ning player on an harp: and it sha2l come to pa2s, when the evil spirit from God is upon th2e, that he sha2l play with his hand, and thou shalt be we2l. 
And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play we2l, and bring him to me. 
Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have s2en a son of Je2se the Bethlehemite, that is cu2ning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in ma2ters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him. 
Wherefore Saul sent me2sengers unto Je2se, and said, Send me David thy son, which is with the sh2ep. 
And Je2se t2ok an a2s laden with bread, and a bo2tle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul. 
And David came to Saul, and st2od before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer. 
And Saul sent to Je2se, saying, Let David, I pray th2e, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight. 
And it came to pa2s, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David t2ok an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was we2l, and the evil spirit departed from him. 
Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to ba2tle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched betw2en Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesda2mim. 
And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the va2ley of Elah, and set the ba2tle in a2ray against the Philistines. 
And the Philistines st2od on a mountain on the one side, and Israel st2od on a mountain on the other side: and there was a va2ley betw2en them. 
And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. 
And he had an helmet of bra2s upon his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bra2s. 
And he had greaves of bra2s upon his legs, and a target of bra2s betw2en his shoulders. 
And the sta2f of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him. 
And he st2od and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your ba2tle in a2ray? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? ch2ose you a man for you, and let him come down to me. 
If he be able to fight with me, and to ki2l me, then wi2l we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and ki2l him, then sha2l ye be our servants, and serve us. 
And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together. 
When Saul and a2l Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid. 
Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Je2se; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul. 
And the thr2e eldest sons of Je2se went and fo2lowed Saul to the ba2tle: and the names of his thr2e sons that went to the ba2tle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Sha2mah. 
And David was the youngest: and the thr2e eldest fo2lowed Saul. 
But David went and returned from Saul to f2ed his father's sh2ep at Bethlehem. 
And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days. 
And Je2se said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp of thy brethren; 
And ca2ry these ten ch2eses unto the captain of their thousand, and l2ok how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge. 
Now Saul, and they, and a2l the men of Israel, were in the va2ley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines. 
And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sh2ep with a k2eper, and t2ok, and went, as Je2se had co2manded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the ba2tle. 
For Israel and the Philistines had put the ba2tle in a2ray, army against army. 
And David left his ca2riage in the hand of the k2eper of the ca2riage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren. 
And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake a2cording to the same words: and David heard them. 
And a2l the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid. 
And the men of Israel said, Have ye s2en this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it sha2l be, that the man who ki2leth him, the king wi2l enrich him with great riches, and wi2l give him his daughter, and make his father's house fr2e in Israel. 
And David spake to the men that st2od by him, saying, What sha2l be done to the man that ki2leth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God? 
And the people answered him after this ma2ner, saying, So sha2l it be done to the man that ki2leth him. 
And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sh2ep in the wilderne2s? I know thy pride, and the naughtine2s of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest s2e the ba2tle. 
And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause? 
And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same ma2ner: and the people answered him again after the former ma2ner. 
And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him. 
And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant wi2l go and fight with this Philistine. 
And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth. 
And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sh2ep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and t2ok a lamb out of the flock: 
And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him. 
Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine sha2l be as one of them, s2eing he hath defied the armies of the living God. 
David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he wi2l deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with th2e. 
And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of bra2s upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail. 
And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he a2sayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I ca2not go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them o2f him. 
And he t2ok his sta2f in his hand, and chose him five sm2oth stones out of the br2ok, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine. 
And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him. 
And when the Philistine l2oked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ru2dy, and of a fair countenance. 
And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 
And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I wi2l give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field. 
Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to th2e in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied. 
This day wi2l the LORD deliver th2e into mine hand; and I wi2l smite th2e, and take thine head from th2e; and I wi2l give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that a2l the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. 
And a2l this a2sembly sha2l know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the ba2tle is the LORD's, and he wi2l give you into our hands. 
And it came to pa2s, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew nigh to m2et David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to m2et the Philistine. 
And David put his hand in his bag, and t2ok thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fe2l upon his face to the earth. 
So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David. 
Therefore David ran, and st2od upon the Philistine, and t2ok his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut o2f his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled. 
And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the va2ley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fe2l down by the way to Sh2araim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron. 
And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents. 
And David t2ok the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent. 
And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I ca2not te2l. 
And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is. 
And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner t2ok him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. 
And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Je2se the Bethlehemite. 
And it came to pa2s, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. 
And Saul t2ok him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house. 
Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. 
And Jonathan stri2ped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle. 
And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was a2cepted in the sight of a2l the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants. 
And it came to pa2s as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of a2l cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to m2et king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick. 
And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands. 
And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom? 
And Saul eyed David from that day and forward. 
And it came to pa2s on the mo2row, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul's hand. 
And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I wi2l smite David even to the wa2l with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice. 
And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul. 
Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people. 
And David behaved himself wisely in a2l his ways; and the LORD was with him. 
Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him. 
But a2l Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them. 
And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her wi2l I give th2e to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD's ba2tles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him. 
And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king? 
But it came to pa2s at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have b2en given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife. 
And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. 
And Saul said, I wi2l give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain. 
And Saul co2manded his servants, saying, Co2mune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in th2e, and a2l his servants love th2e: now therefore be the king's son in law. 
And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, S2emeth it to you a light thing to be a king's son in law, s2eing that I am a p2or man, and lightly est2emed? 
And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this ma2ner spake David. 
And Saul said, Thus sha2l ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fa2l by the hand of the Philistines. 
And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David we2l to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired. 
Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in fu2l tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife. 
And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul's daughter loved him. 
And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continua2ly. 
Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pa2s, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than a2l the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by. 
And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to a2l his servants, that they should ki2l David. 
But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father s2eketh to ki2l th2e: now therefore, I pray th2e, take h2ed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself: 
And I wi2l go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I wi2l co2mune with my father of th2e; and what I s2e, that I wi2l te2l th2e. 
And Jonathan spake g2od of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not si2ned against th2e, and because his works have b2en to th2e-ward very g2od: 
For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for a2l Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against i2nocent bl2od, to slay David without a cause? 
And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, As the LORD liveth, he sha2l not be slain. 
And Jonathan ca2led David, and Jonathan shewed him a2l those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past. 
And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him. 
And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with his hand. 
And Saul sought to smite David even to the wa2l with the javelin: but he sli2ped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wa2l: and David fled, and escaped that night. 
Saul also sent me2sengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to mo2row thou shalt be slain. 
So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped. 
And Michal t2ok an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a pi2low of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a cloth. 
And when Saul sent me2sengers to take David, she said, He is sick. 
And Saul sent the me2sengers again to s2e David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him. 
And when the me2sengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed, with a pi2low of goats' hair for his bolster. 
And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I ki2l th2e? 
So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him a2l that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth. 
And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah. 
And Saul sent me2sengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as a2pointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the me2sengers of Saul, and they also prophesied. 
And when it was told Saul, he sent other me2sengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent me2sengers again the third time, and they prophesied also. 
Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great we2l that is in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah. 
And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah. 
And he stri2ped o2f his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like ma2ner, and lay down naked a2l that day and a2l that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the prophets? 
And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is my sin before thy father, that he s2eketh my life? 
And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father wi2l do nothing either great or sma2l, but that he wi2l shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so. 
And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step betw2en me and death. 
Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I wi2l even do it for th2e. 
And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to mo2row is the new m2on, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even. 
If thy father at a2l mi2s me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is a yearly sacrifice there for a2l the family. 
If he say thus, It is we2l; thy servant sha2l have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him. 
Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with th2e: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father? 
And Jonathan said, Far be it from th2e: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon th2e, then would not I te2l it th2e? 
Then said David to Jonathan, Who sha2l te2l me? or what if thy father answer th2e roughly? 
And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field. 
And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to mo2row any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be g2od toward David, and I then send not unto th2e, and shew it th2e; 
The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do th2e evil, then I wi2l shew it th2e, and send th2e away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with th2e, as he hath b2en with my father. 
And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindne2s of the LORD, that I die not: 
But also thou shalt not cut o2f thy kindne2s from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut o2f the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth. 
So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies. 
And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul. 
Then Jonathan said to David, To mo2row is the new m2on: and thou shalt be mi2sed, because thy seat wi2l be empty. 
And when thou hast stayed thr2e days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the busine2s was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel. 
And I wi2l sh2ot thr2e a2rows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark. 
And, behold, I wi2l send a lad, saying, Go, find out the a2rows. If I expre2sly say unto the lad, Behold, the a2rows are on this side of th2e, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to th2e, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth. 
But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the a2rows are beyond th2e; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent th2e away. 
And as touching the ma2ter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be betw2en th2e and me for ever. 
So David hid himself in the field: and when the new m2on was come, the king sat him down to eat meat. 
And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wa2l: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty. 
Neverthele2s Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befa2len him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean. 
And it came to pa2s on the mo2row, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Je2se to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day? 
And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem: 
And he said, Let me go, I pray th2e; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath co2manded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray th2e, and s2e my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table. 
Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebe2lious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Je2se to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedne2s? 
For as long as the son of Je2se liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he sha2l surely die. 
And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore sha2l he be slain? what hath he done? 
And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David. 
So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame. 
And it came to pa2s in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time a2pointed with David, and a li2tle lad with him. 
And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the a2rows which I sh2ot. And as the lad ran, he shot an a2row beyond him. 
And when the lad was come to the place of the a2row which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the a2row beyond th2e? 
And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make sp2ed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the a2rows, and came to his master. 
But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the ma2ter. 
And Jonathan gave his arti2lery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, ca2ry them to the city. 
And as s2on as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fe2l on his face to the ground, and bowed himself thr2e times: and they ki2sed one another, and wept one with another, until David exc2eded. 
And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be betw2en me and th2e, and betw2en my s2ed and thy s2ed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city. 
Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the m2eting of David, and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no man with th2e? 
And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath co2manded me a busine2s, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the busine2s whereabout I send th2e, and what I have co2manded th2e: and I have a2pointed my servants to such and such a place. 
Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of bread in mine hand, or what there is present. 
And the priest answered David, and said, There is no co2mon bread under mine hand, but there is ha2lowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women. 
And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have b2en kept from us about these thr2e days, since I came out, and the ve2sels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a ma2ner co2mon, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the ve2sel. 
So the priest gave him ha2lowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away. 
Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul. 
And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's busine2s required haste. 
And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the va2ley of Elah, behold, it is here wra2ped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me. 
And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. 
And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands? 
And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath. 
And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scra2bled on the d2ors of the gate, and let his spi2tle fa2l down upon his beard. 
Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye s2e the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me? 
Have I n2ed of mad men, that ye have brought this fe2low to play the mad man in my presence? sha2l this fe2low come into my house? 
David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adu2lam: and when his brethren and a2l his father's house heard it, they went down thither to him. 
And every one that was in distre2s, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men. 
And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray th2e, come forth, and be with you, ti2l I know what God wi2l do for me. 
And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him a2l the while that David was in the hold. 
And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get th2e into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth. 
When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tr2e in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and a2l his servants were standing about him;) 
Then Saul said unto his servants that st2od about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; wi2l the son of Je2se give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you a2l captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds; 
That a2l of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Je2se, and there is none of you that is so2ry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath sti2red up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day? 
Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Je2se coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. 
And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine. 
Then the king sent to ca2l Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and a2l his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came a2l of them to the king. 
And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord. 
And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Je2se, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day? 
Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so faithful among a2l thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bi2ding, and is honourable in thine house? 
Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to a2l the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of a2l this, le2s or more. 
And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and a2l thy father's house. 
And the king said unto the f2otmen that st2od about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fa2l upon the priests of the LORD. 
And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fa2l upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fe2l upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod. 
And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and a2ses, and sh2ep, with the edge of the sword. 
And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David. 
And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD's priests. 
And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely te2l Saul: I have o2casioned the death of a2l the persons of thy father's house. 
Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that s2eketh my life s2eketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard. 
Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfl2ors. 
Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Sha2l I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah. 
And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines? 
Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I wi2l deliver the Philistines into thine hand. 
So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their ca2tle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah. 
And it came to pa2s, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand. 
And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars. 
And Saul ca2led a2l the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. 
And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod. 
Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul s2eketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake. 
Wi2l the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? wi2l Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I bes2ech th2e, te2l thy servant. And the LORD said, He wi2l come down. 
Then said David, Wi2l the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They wi2l deliver th2e up. 
Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth. 
And David abode in the wilderne2s in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderne2s of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand. 
And David saw that Saul was come out to s2ek his life: and David was in the wilderne2s of Ziph in a w2od. 
And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the w2od, and strengthened his hand in God. 
And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father sha2l not find th2e; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I sha2l be next unto th2e; and that also Saul my father knoweth. 
And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the w2od, and Jonathan went to his house. 
Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the w2od, in the hi2l of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon? 
Now therefore, O king, come down a2cording to a2l the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part sha2l be to deliver him into the king's hand. 
And Saul said, Ble2sed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compa2sion on me. 
Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and s2e his place where his haunt is, and who hath s2en him there: for it is told me that he dealeth very subti2ly. 
S2e therefore, and take knowledge of a2l the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I wi2l go with you: and it sha2l come to pa2s, if he be in the land, that I wi2l search him out throughout a2l the thousands of Judah. 
And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderne2s of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon. 
Saul also and his men went to s2ek him. And they told David; wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderne2s of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderne2s of Maon. 
And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compa2sed David and his men round about to take them. 
But there came a me2senger unto Saul, saying, Haste th2e, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land. 
Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they ca2led that place Selaha2mahlekoth. 
And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi. 
And it came to pa2s, when Saul was returned from fo2lowing the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderne2s of Engedi. 
Then Saul t2ok thr2e thousand chosen men out of a2l Israel, and went to s2ek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats. 
And he came to the sh2epcotes by the way, where was a cave; and Saul went in to cover his f2et: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave. 
And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto th2e, Behold, I wi2l deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it sha2l s2em g2od unto th2e. Then David arose, and cut o2f the skirt of Saul's robe privily. 
And it came to pa2s afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut o2f Saul's skirt. 
And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, s2eing he is the anointed of the LORD. 
So David stayed his servants with these words, and su2fered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way. 
David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul l2oked behind him, David st2oped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself. 
And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David s2eketh thy hurt? 
Behold, this day thine eyes have s2en how that the LORD had delivered th2e to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me ki2l th2e: but mine eye spared th2e; and I said, I wi2l not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORD's anointed. 
Moreover, my father, s2e, yea, s2e the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut o2f the skirt of thy robe, and ki2led th2e not, know thou and s2e that there is neither evil nor transgre2sion in mine hand, and I have not si2ned against th2e; yet thou huntest my soul to take it. 
The LORD judge betw2en me and th2e, and the LORD avenge me of th2e: but mine hand sha2l not be upon th2e. 
As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedne2s proc2edeth from the wicked: but mine hand sha2l not be upon th2e. 
After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea. 
The LORD therefore be judge, and judge betw2en me and th2e, and s2e, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand. 
And it came to pa2s, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept. 
And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me g2od, whereas I have rewarded th2e evil. 
And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt we2l with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou ki2ledst me not. 
For if a man find his enemy, wi2l he let him go we2l away? wherefore the LORD reward th2e g2od for that thou hast done unto me this day. 
And now, behold, I know we2l that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel sha2l be established in thine hand. 
Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut o2f my s2ed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house. 
And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold. 
And Samuel died; and a2l the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderne2s of Paran. 
And there was a man in Maon, whose po2se2sions were in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had thr2e thousand sh2ep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sh2ep in Carmel. 
Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of g2od understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb. 
And David heard in the wilderne2s that Nabal did shear his sh2ep. 
And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and gr2et him in my name: 
And thus sha2l ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to th2e, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto a2l that thou hast. 
And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought mi2sing unto them, a2l the while they were in Carmel. 
Ask thy young men, and they wi2l shew th2e. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a g2od day: give, I pray th2e, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David. 
And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal a2cording to a2l those words in the name of David, and ceased. 
And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Je2se? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master. 
Sha2l I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have ki2led for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be? 
So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him a2l those sayings. 
And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stu2f. 
But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent me2sengers out of the wilderne2s to salute our master; and he railed on them. 
But the men were very g2od unto us, and we were not hurt, neither mi2sed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields: 
They were a wa2l unto us both by night and day, a2l the while we were with them k2eping the sh2ep. 
Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against a2l his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man ca2not speak to him. 
Then Abigail made haste, and t2ok two hundred loaves, and two bo2tles of wine, and five sh2ep ready dre2sed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on a2ses. 
And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal. 
And it was so, as she rode on the a2s, that she came down by the covert on the hi2l, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them. 
Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept a2l that this fe2low hath in the wilderne2s, so that nothing was mi2sed of a2l that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for g2od. 
So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of a2l that pertain to him by the morning light any that pi2seth against the wa2l. 
And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted o2f the a2s, and fe2l before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, 
And fe2l at his f2et, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray th2e, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid. 
Let not my lord, I pray th2e, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and fo2ly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send. 
Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, s2eing the LORD hath wit2holden th2e from coming to shed bl2od, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that s2ek evil to my lord, be as Nabal. 
And now this ble2sing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that fo2low my lord. 
I pray th2e, forgive the trespa2s of thine handmaid: for the LORD wi2l certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the ba2tles of the LORD, and evil hath not b2en found in th2e a2l thy days. 
Yet a man is risen to pursue th2e, and to s2ek thy soul: but the soul of my lord sha2l be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them sha2l he sling out, as out of the mi2dle of a sling. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, when the LORD sha2l have done to my lord a2cording to a2l the g2od that he hath spoken concerning th2e, and sha2l have a2pointed th2e ruler over Israel; 
That this sha2l be no grief unto th2e, nor o2fence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed bl2od causele2s, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD sha2l have dealt we2l with my lord, then remember thine handmaid. 
And David said to Abigail, Ble2sed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent th2e this day to m2et me: 
And ble2sed be thy advice, and ble2sed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed bl2od, and from avenging myself with mine own hand. 
For in very d2ed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting th2e, except thou hadst hasted and come to m2et me, surely there had not b2en left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pi2seth against the wa2l. 
So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; s2e, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have a2cepted thy person. 
And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was me2ry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, le2s or more, until the morning light. 
But it came to pa2s in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone. 
And it came to pa2s about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died. 
And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Ble2sed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedne2s of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and co2muned with Abigail, to take her to him to wife. 
And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto th2e, to take th2e to him to wife. 
And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the f2et of the servants of my lord. 
And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an a2s, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the me2sengers of David, and became his wife. 
David also t2ok Ahinoam of Jezr2el; and they were also both of them his wives. 
But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Ga2lim. 
And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hi2l of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon? 
Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderne2s of Ziph, having thr2e thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to s2ek David in the wilderne2s of Ziph. 
And Saul pitched in the hi2l of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderne2s, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderne2s. 
David therefore sent out spies, and underst2od that Saul was come in very d2ed. 
And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him. 
Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hi2tite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who wi2l go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I wi2l go down with th2e. 
So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sl2eping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him. 
Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray th2e, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I wi2l not smite him the second time. 
And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be guiltle2s? 
David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD sha2l smite him; or his day sha2l come to die; or he sha2l descend into ba2tle, and perish. 
The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed: but, I pray th2e, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go. 
So David t2ok the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were a2l asl2ep; because a d2ep sl2ep from the LORD was fa2len upon them. 
Then David went over to the other side, and st2od on the top of an hi2l afar o2f; a great space being betw2en them: 
And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king? 
And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to th2e in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord. 
This thing is not g2od that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed. And now s2e where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster. 
And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king. 
And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand? 
Now therefore, I pray th2e, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have sti2red th2e up against me, let him a2cept an o2fering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods. 
Now therefore, let not my bl2od fa2l to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to s2ek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains. 
Then said Saul, I have si2ned: return, my son David: for I wi2l no more do th2e harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the f2ol, and have e2red exc2edingly. 
And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it. 
The LORD render to every man his righteousne2s and his faithfulne2s; for the LORD delivered th2e into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's anointed. 
And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of a2l tribulation. 
Then Saul said to David, Ble2sed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt sti2l prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place. 
And David said in his heart, I sha2l now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing be2ter for me than that I should sp2edily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul sha2l despair of me, to s2ek me any more in any coast of Israel: so sha2l I escape out of his hand. 
And David arose, and he pa2sed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath. 
And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezr2elite2s, and Abigail the Carmelite2s, Nabal's wife. 
And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him. 
And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwe2l there: for why should thy servant dwe2l in the royal city with th2e? 
Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day. 
And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a fu2l year and four months. 
And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt. 
And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and t2ok away the sh2ep, and the oxen, and the a2ses, and the camels, and the a2parel, and returned, and came to Achish. 
And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahm2elites, and against the south of the Kenites. 
And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should te2l on us, saying, So did David, and so wi2l be his ma2ner a2l the while he dwe2leth in the country of the Philistines. 
And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel u2terly to abhor him; therefore he sha2l be my servant for ever. 
And it came to pa2s in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou a2suredly, that thou shalt go out with me to ba2tle, thou and thy men. 
And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore wi2l I make th2e k2eper of mine head for ever. 
Now Samuel was dead, and a2l Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land. 
And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered a2l Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa. 
And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled. 
And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets. 
Then said Saul unto his servants, S2ek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor. 
And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray th2e, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I sha2l name unto th2e. 
And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut o2f those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die? 
And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there sha2l no punishment ha2pen to th2e for this thing. 
Then said the woman, Whom sha2l I bring up unto th2e? And he said, Bring me up Samuel. 
And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul. 
And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth. 
And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he st2oped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself. 
And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distre2sed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have ca2led th2e, that thou mayest make known unto me what I sha2l do. 
Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, s2eing the LORD is departed from th2e, and is become thine enemy? 
And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even to David: 
Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto th2e this day. 
Moreover the LORD wi2l also deliver Israel with th2e into the hand of the Philistines: and to mo2row shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the LORD also sha2l deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines. 
Then Saul fe2l straightway a2l along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread a2l the day, nor a2l the night. 
And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me. 
Now therefore, I pray th2e, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before th2e; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way. 
But he refused, and said, I wi2l not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compe2led him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed. 
And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and ki2led it, and t2ok flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof: 
And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night. 
Now the Philistines gathered together a2l their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezr2el. 
And the lords of the Philistines pa2sed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men pa2sed on in the rereward with Achish. 
Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath b2en with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fe2l unto me unto this day? 
And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fe2low return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast a2pointed him, and let him not go down with us to ba2tle, lest in the ba2tle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men? 
Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands? 
Then Achish ca2led David, and said unto him, Surely, as the LORD liveth, thou hast b2en upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is g2od in my sight: for I have not found evil in th2e since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: neverthele2s the lords favour th2e not. 
Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines. 
And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have b2en with th2e unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king? 
And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art g2od in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He sha2l not go up with us to the ba2tle. 
Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with th2e: and as s2on as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart. 
So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezr2el. 
And it came to pa2s, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smi2ten Ziklag, and burned it with fire; 
And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew not any, either great or sma2l, but ca2ried them away, and went on their way. 
So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives. 
Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to w2ep. 
And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezr2elite2s, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 
And David was greatly distre2sed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of a2l the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God. 
And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray th2e, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David. 
And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Sha2l I pursue after this tr2op? sha2l I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover a2l. 
So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the br2ok Besor, where those that were left behind stayed. 
But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the br2ok Besor. 
And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water; 
And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, thr2e days and thr2e nights. 
And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because thr2e days agone I fe2l sick. 
We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire. 
And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither ki2l me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I wi2l bring th2e down to this company. 
And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon a2l the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of a2l the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah. 
And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled. 
And David recovered a2l that the Amalekites had ca2ried away: and David rescued his two wives. 
And there was nothing lacking to them, neither sma2l nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered a2l. 
And David t2ok a2l the flocks and the herds, which they drave before those other ca2tle, and said, This is David's spoil. 
And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not fo2low David, whom they had made also to abide at the br2ok Besor: and they went forth to m2et David, and to m2et the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them. 
Then answered a2l the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we wi2l not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart. 
Then said David, Ye sha2l not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand. 
For who wi2l hearken unto you in this ma2ter? but as his part is that goeth down to the ba2tle, so sha2l his part be that ta2rieth by the stu2f: they sha2l part alike. 
And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day. 
And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD; 
To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Ja2tir, 
And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa, 
And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahm2elites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites, 
And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach, 
And to them which were in Hebron, and to a2l the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt. 
Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fe2l down slain in mount Gilboa. 
And the Philistines fo2lowed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, Saul's sons. 
And the ba2tle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers. 
Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul t2ok a sword, and fe2l upon it. 
And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fe2l likewise upon his sword, and died with him. 
So Saul died, and his thr2e sons, and his armourbearer, and a2l his men, that same day together. 
And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the va2ley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they fors2ok the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. 
And it came to pa2s on the mo2row, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his thr2e sons fa2len in mount Gilboa. 
And they cut o2f his head, and stri2ped o2f his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people. 
And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wa2l of Bethshan. 
And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul; 
A2l the valiant men arose, and went a2l night, and t2ok the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wa2l of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there. 
And they t2ok their bones, and buried them under a tr2e at Jabesh, and fasted seven days. 
Now it came to pa2s after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; 
It came even to pa2s on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fe2l to the earth, and did obeisance. 
And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped. 
And David said unto him, How went the ma2ter? I pray th2e, te2l me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the ba2tle, and many of the people also are fa2len and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. 
And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead? 
And the young man that told him said, As I ha2pened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen fo2lowed hard after him. 
And when he l2oked behind him, he saw me, and ca2led unto me. And I answered, Here am I. 
And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite. 
He said unto me again, Stand, I pray th2e, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me. 
So I st2od upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fa2len: and I t2ok the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord. 
Then David t2ok hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise a2l the men that were with him: 
And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fa2len by the sword. 
And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite. 
And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed? 
And David ca2led one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fa2l upon him. And he smote him that he died. 
And David said unto him, Thy bl2od be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against th2e, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed. 
And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son: 
(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is wri2ten in the b2ok of Jasher.) 
The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fa2len! 
Te2l it not in Gath, publish it not in the str2ets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. 
Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of o2ferings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not b2en anointed with oil. 
From the bl2od of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty. 
Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. 
Ye daughters of Israel, w2ep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your a2parel. 
How are the mighty fa2len in the midst of the ba2tle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places. 
I am distre2sed for th2e, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou b2en unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, pa2sing the love of women. 
How are the mighty fa2len, and the weapons of war perished! 
And it came to pa2s after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Sha2l I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither sha2l I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron. 
So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezr2elite2s, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite. 
And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron. 
And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul. 
And David sent me2sengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Ble2sed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindne2s unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him. 
And now the LORD shew kindne2s and truth unto you: and I also wi2l requite you this kindne2s, because ye have done this thing. 
Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them. 
But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, t2ok Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim; 
And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezr2el, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over a2l Israel. 
Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah fo2lowed David. 
And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months. 
And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 
And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the p2ol of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the p2ol, and the other on the other side of the p2ol. 
And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise. 
Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. 
And they caught every one his fe2low by the head, and thrust his sword in his fe2low's side; so they fe2l down together: wherefore that place was ca2led Helkat2ha2zurim, which is in Gibeon. 
And there was a very sore ba2tle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David. 
And there were thr2e sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of f2ot as a wild roe. 
And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from fo2lowing Abner. 
Then Abner l2oked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am. 
And Abner said to him, Turn th2e aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay th2e hold on one of the young men, and take th2e his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from fo2lowing of him. 
And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn th2e aside from fo2lowing me: wherefore should I smite th2e to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother? 
Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fe2l down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pa2s, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fe2l down and died st2od sti2l. 
Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hi2l of A2mah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderne2s of Gibeon. 
And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one tr2op, and st2od on the top of an hi2l. 
Then Abner ca2led to Joab, and said, Sha2l the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it wi2l be bi2terne2s in the la2ter end? how long sha2l it be then, ere thou bid the people return from fo2lowing their brethren? 
And Joab said, As God liveth, unle2s thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from fo2lowing his brother. 
So Joab blew a trumpet, and a2l the people st2od sti2l, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more. 
And Abner and his men walked a2l that night through the plain, and pa2sed over Jordan, and went through a2l Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim. 
And Joab returned from fo2lowing Abner: and when he had gathered a2l the people together, there lacked of David's servants ninet2en men and Asahel. 
But the servants of David had smi2ten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that thr2e hundred and thr2escore men died. 
And they t2ok up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went a2l night, and they came to Hebron at break of day. 
Now there was long war betw2en the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker. 
And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezr2elite2s; 
And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of M2acah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; 
And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Ha2gith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; 
And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron. 
And it came to pa2s, while there was war betw2en the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul. 
And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine? 
Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindne2s this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered th2e into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman? 
So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him; 
To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to B2ersheba. 
And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him. 
And Abner sent me2sengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand sha2l be with th2e, to bring about a2l Israel unto th2e. 
And he said, We2l; I wi2l make a league with th2e: but one thing I require of th2e, that is, Thou shalt not s2e my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to s2e my face. 
And David sent me2sengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines. 
And Ishbosheth sent, and t2ok her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish. 
And her husband went with her along w2eping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned. 
And Abner had co2munication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you: 
Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I wi2l save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of a2l their enemies. 
And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron a2l that s2emed g2od to Israel, and that s2emed g2od to the whole house of Benjamin. 
So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast. 
And Abner said unto David, I wi2l arise and go, and wi2l gather a2l Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with th2e, and that thou mayest reign over a2l that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace. 
And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a tr2op, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace. 
When Joab and a2l the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace. 
Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto th2e; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone? 
Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive th2e, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know a2l that thou doest. 
And when Joab was come out from David, he sent me2sengers after Abner, which brought him again from the we2l of Sirah: but David knew it not. 
And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab t2ok him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the bl2od of Asahel his brother. 
And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltle2s before the LORD for ever from the bl2od of Abner the son of Ner: 
Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on a2l his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an i2sue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a sta2f, or that fa2leth on the sword, or that lacketh bread. 
So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the ba2tle. 
And David said to Joab, and to a2l the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself fo2lowed the bier. 
And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and a2l the people wept. 
And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a f2ol dieth? 
Thy hands were not bound, nor thy f2et put into fe2ters: as a man fa2leth before wicked men, so fe2lest thou. And a2l the people wept again over him. 
And when a2l the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, ti2l the sun be down. 
And a2l the people t2ok notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased a2l the people. 
For a2l the people and a2l Israel underst2od that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner. 
And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fa2len this day in Israel? 
And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be t2o hard for me: the LORD sha2l reward the doer of evil a2cording to his wickedne2s. 
And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were f2eble, and a2l the Israelites were troubled. 
And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was B2anah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Ri2mon a B2erothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for B2eroth also was reckoned to Benjamin. 
And the B2erothites fled to Gi2taim, and were sojourners there until this day.) 
And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his f2et. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezr2el, and his nurse t2ok him up, and fled: and it came to pa2s, as she made haste to fl2e, that he fe2l, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth. 
And the sons of Ri2mon the B2erothite, Rechab and B2anah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at n2on. 
And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and B2anah his brother escaped. 
For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and t2ok his head, and gat them away through the plain a2l night. 
And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his s2ed. 
And David answered Rechab and B2anah his brother, the sons of Ri2mon the B2erothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth, who hath red2emed my soul out of a2l adversity, 
When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought g2od tidings, I t2ok hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings: 
How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? sha2l I not therefore now require his bl2od of your hand, and take you away from the earth? 
And David co2manded his young men, and they slew them, and cut o2f their hands and their f2et, and hanged them up over the p2ol in Hebron. But they t2ok the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron. 
Then came a2l the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. 
Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that le2dest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to th2e, Thou shalt f2ed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel. 
So a2l the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel. 
David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. 
In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and thr2e years over a2l Israel and Judah. 
And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David ca2not come in hither. 
Neverthele2s David t2ok the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David. 
And David said on that day, Whosoever ge2teth up to the gu2ter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's soul, he sha2l be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame sha2l not come into the house. 
So David dwelt in the fort, and ca2led it the city of David. And David built round about from Mi2lo and inward. 
And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him. 
And Hiram king of Tyre sent me2sengers to David, and cedar tr2es, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house. 
And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake. 
And David t2ok him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David. 
And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Sha2muah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, 
Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 
And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet. 
But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, a2l the Philistines came up to s2ek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold. 
The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the va2ley of Rephaim. 
And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Sha2l I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I wi2l doubtle2s deliver the Philistines into thine hand. 
And David came to B2alperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he ca2led the name of that place B2alperazim. 
And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them. 
And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the va2ley of Rephaim. 
And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compa2s behind them, and come upon them over against the mulbe2ry tr2es. 
And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulbe2ry tr2es, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then sha2l the LORD go out before th2e, to smite the host of the Philistines. 
And David did so, as the LORD had co2manded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer. 
Again, David gathered together a2l the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. 
And David arose, and went with a2l the people that were with him from B2ale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is ca2led by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwe2leth betw2en the cherubims. 
And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and U2zah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart. 
And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, a2companying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark. 
And David and a2l the house of Israel played before the LORD on a2l ma2ner of instruments made of fir w2od, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals. 
And when they came to Nachon's threshingfl2or, U2zah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and t2ok hold of it; for the oxen sh2ok it. 
And the anger of the LORD was kindled against U2zah; and God smote him there for his e2ror; and there he died by the ark of God. 
And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon U2zah: and he ca2led the name of the place Perezu2zah to this day. 
And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How sha2l the ark of the LORD come to me? 
So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David ca2ried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gi2tite. 
And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gi2tite thr2e months: and the LORD ble2sed Obededom, and a2l his household. 
And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath ble2sed the house of Obededom, and a2l that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladne2s. 
And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings. 
And David danced before the LORD with a2l his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod. 
So David and a2l the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet. 
And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter l2oked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart. 
And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David o2fered burnt o2ferings and peace o2ferings before the LORD. 
And as s2on as David had made an end of o2fering burnt o2ferings and peace o2ferings, he ble2sed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts. 
And he dealt among a2l the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as we2l to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a g2od piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So a2l the people departed every one to his house. 
Then David returned to ble2s his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to m2et David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fe2lows shamele2sly uncovereth himself! 
And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before a2l his house, to a2point me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore wi2l I play before the LORD. 
And I wi2l yet be more vile than thus, and wi2l be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them sha2l I be had in honour. 
Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death. 
And it came to pa2s, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from a2l his enemies; 
That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, S2e now, I dwe2l in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwe2leth within curtains. 
And Nathan said to the king, Go, do a2l that is in thine heart; for the LORD is with th2e. 
And it came to pa2s that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying, 
Go and te2l my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwe2l in? 
Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle. 
In a2l the places wherein I have walked with a2l the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I co2manded to f2ed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar? 
Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I t2ok th2e from the sh2epcote, from fo2lowing the sh2ep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel: 
And I was with th2e whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut o2f a2l thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made th2e a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth. 
Moreover I wi2l a2point a place for my people Israel, and wi2l plant them, that they may dwe2l in a place of their own, and move no more; neither sha2l the children of wickedne2s a2flict them any more, as beforetime, 
And as since the time that I co2manded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused th2e to rest from a2l thine enemies. Also the LORD te2leth th2e that he wi2l make th2e an house. 
And when thy days be fulfi2led, and thou shalt sl2ep with thy fathers, I wi2l set up thy s2ed after th2e, which sha2l proc2ed out of thy bowels, and I wi2l establish his kingdom. 
He sha2l build an house for my name, and I wi2l stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever. 
I wi2l be his father, and he sha2l be my son. If he co2mit iniquity, I wi2l chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men: 
But my mercy sha2l not depart away from him, as I t2ok it from Saul, whom I put away before th2e. 
And thine house and thy kingdom sha2l be established for ever before th2e: thy throne sha2l be established for ever. 
A2cording to a2l these words, and a2cording to a2l this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. 
Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? 
And this was yet a sma2l thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the ma2ner of man, O Lord GOD? 
And what can David say more unto th2e? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant. 
For thy word's sake, and a2cording to thine own heart, hast thou done a2l these great things, to make thy servant know them. 
Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like th2e, neither is there any God beside th2e, a2cording to a2l that we have heard with our ears. 
And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to red2em for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and te2rible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou red2emedst to th2e from Egypt, from the nations and their gods? 
For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto th2e for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God. 
And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said. 
And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before th2e. 
For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I wi2l build th2e an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto th2e. 
And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this g2odne2s unto thy servant: 
Therefore now let it please th2e to ble2s the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before th2e: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy ble2sing let the house of thy servant be ble2sed for ever. 
And after this it came to pa2s that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David t2ok Methega2mah out of the hand of the Philistines. 
And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one fu2l line to k2ep alive. And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts. 
David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates. 
And David t2ok from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand f2otmen: and David houghed a2l the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots. 
And when the Syrians of Damascus came to su2cour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. 
Then David put ga2risons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. 
And David t2ok the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David t2ok exc2eding much bra2s. 
When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smi2ten a2l the host of Hadadezer, 
Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to ble2s him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smi2ten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him ve2sels of silver, and ve2sels of gold, and ve2sels of bra2s: 
Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of a2l nations which he subdued; 
Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of A2mon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. 
And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the va2ley of salt, being eight2en thousand men. 
And he put ga2risons in Edom; throughout a2l Edom put he ga2risons, and a2l they of Edom became David's servants. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. 
And David reigned over a2l Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto a2l his people. 
And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; 
And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe; 
And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers. 
And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindne2s for Jonathan's sake? 
And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they had ca2led him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he. 
And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindne2s of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his f2et. 
And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of A2miel, in Lodebar. 
Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of A2miel, from Lodebar. 
Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fe2l on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant! 
And David said unto him, Fear not: for I wi2l surely shew th2e kindne2s for Jonathan thy father's sake, and wi2l restore th2e a2l the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continua2ly. 
And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest l2ok upon such a dead dog as I am? 
Then the king ca2led to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son a2l that pertained to Saul and to a2l his house. 
Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, sha2l ti2l the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have f2od to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son sha2l eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fift2en sons and twenty servants. 
Then said Ziba unto the king, A2cording to a2l that my lord the king hath co2manded his servant, so sha2l thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he sha2l eat at my table, as one of the king's sons. 
And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And a2l that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth. 
So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continua2ly at the king's table; and was lame on both his f2et. 
And it came to pa2s after this, that the king of the children of A2mon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead. 
Then said David, I wi2l shew kindne2s unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindne2s unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of A2mon. 
And the princes of the children of A2mon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto th2e? hath not David rather sent his servants unto th2e, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it? 
Wherefore Hanun t2ok David's servants, and shaved o2f the one half of their beards, and cut o2f their garments in the mi2dle, even to their bu2tocks, and sent them away. 
When they told it unto David, he sent to m2et them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Ta2ry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return. 
And when the children of A2mon saw that they stank before David, the children of A2mon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand f2otmen, and of king M2acah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men. 
And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and a2l the host of the mighty men. 
And the children of A2mon came out, and put the ba2tle in a2ray at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and M2acah, were by themselves in the field. 
When Joab saw that the front of the ba2tle was against him before and behind, he chose of a2l the choice men of Israel, and put them in a2ray against the Syrians: 
And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in a2ray against the children of A2mon. 
And he said, If the Syrians be t2o strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of A2mon be t2o strong for th2e, then I wi2l come and help th2e. 
Be of g2od courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which s2emeth him g2od. 
And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the ba2tle against the Syrians: and they fled before him. 
And when the children of A2mon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of A2mon, and came to Jerusalem. 
And when the Syrians saw that they were smi2ten before Israel, they gathered themselves together. 
And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them. 
And when it was told David, he gathered a2l Israel together, and pa2sed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in a2ray against David, and fought with him. 
And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there. 
And when a2l the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smi2ten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of A2mon any more. 
And it came to pa2s, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to ba2tle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and a2l Israel; and they destroyed the children of A2mon, and besieged Ra2bah. But David ta2ried sti2l at Jerusalem. 
And it came to pa2s in an eveningtide, that David arose from o2f his bed, and walked upon the r2of of the king's house: and from the r2of he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to l2ok upon. 
And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hi2tite? 
And David sent me2sengers, and t2ok her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her unclea2ne2s: and she returned unto her house. 
And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child. 
And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hi2tite. And Joab sent Uriah to David. 
And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered. 
And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy f2et. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there fo2lowed him a me2s of meat from the king. 
But Uriah slept at the d2or of the king's house with a2l the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house. 
And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house? 
And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; sha2l I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I wi2l not do this thing. 
And David said to Uriah, Ta2ry here to day also, and to mo2row I wi2l let th2e depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the mo2row. 
And when David had ca2led him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house. 
And it came to pa2s in the morning, that David wrote a le2ter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah. 
And he wrote in the le2ter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the ho2test ba2tle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smi2ten, and die. 
And it came to pa2s, when Joab observed the city, that he a2signed Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were. 
And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fe2l some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hi2tite died also. 
Then Joab sent and told David a2l the things concerning the war; 
And charged the me2senger, saying, When thou hast made an end of te2ling the ma2ters of the war unto the king, 
And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto th2e, Wherefore a2proached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would sh2ot from the wa2l? 
Who smote Abimelech the son of Jeru2besheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a mi2lstone upon him from the wa2l, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wa2l? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hi2tite is dead also. 
So the me2senger went, and came and shewed David a2l that Joab had sent him for. 
And the me2senger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate. 
And the sh2oters shot from o2f the wa2l upon thy servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hi2tite is dead also. 
Then David said unto the me2senger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease th2e, for the sword devoureth one as we2l as another: make thy ba2tle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him. 
And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband. 
And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD. 
And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other p2or. 
The rich man had exc2eding many flocks and herds: 
But the p2or man had nothing, save one li2tle ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter. 
And there came a trave2ler unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dre2s for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but t2ok the p2or man's lamb, and dre2sed it for the man that was come to him. 
And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing sha2l surely die: 
And he sha2l restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity. 
And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed th2e king over Israel, and I delivered th2e out of the hand of Saul; 
And I gave th2e thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave th2e the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had b2en t2o li2tle, I would moreover have given unto th2e such and such things. 
Wherefore hast thou despised the co2mandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast ki2led Uriah the Hi2tite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of A2mon. 
Now therefore the sword sha2l never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hi2tite to be thy wife. 
Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I wi2l raise up evil against th2e out of thine own house, and I wi2l take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he sha2l lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun. 
For thou didst it secretly: but I wi2l do this thing before a2l Israel, and before the sun. 
And David said unto Nathan, I have si2ned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die. 
Howbeit, because by this d2ed thou hast given great o2casion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto th2e sha2l surely die. 
And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick. 
David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay a2l night upon the earth. 
And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them. 
And it came to pa2s on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to te2l him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how wi2l he then vex himself, if we te2l him that the child is dead? 
But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead. 
Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his a2parel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshi2ped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat. 
Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and w2ep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread. 
And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can te2l whether GOD wi2l be gracious to me, that the child may live? 
But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I sha2l go to him, but he sha2l not return to me. 
And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he ca2led his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him. 
And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he ca2led his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD. 
And Joab fought against Ra2bah of the children of A2mon, and t2ok the royal city. 
And Joab sent me2sengers to David, and said, I have fought against Ra2bah, and have taken the city of waters. 
Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be ca2led after my name. 
And David gathered a2l the people together, and went to Ra2bah, and fought against it, and t2ok it. 
And he t2ok their king's crown from o2f his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance. 
And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under ha2rows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pa2s through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto a2l the cities of the children of A2mon. So David and a2l the people returned unto Jerusalem. 
And it came to pa2s after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her. 
And Amnon was so vexed, that he fe2l sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her. 
But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man. 
And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not te2l me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister. 
And Jonadab said unto him, Lay th2e down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to s2e th2e, say unto him, I pray th2e, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dre2s the meat in my sight, that I may s2e it, and eat it at her hand. 
So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to s2e him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray th2e, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand. 
Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dre2s him meat. 
So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she t2ok flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes. 
And she t2ok a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out a2l men from me. And they went out every man from him. 
And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar t2ok the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother. 
And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he t2ok hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister. 
And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this fo2ly. 
And I, whither sha2l I cause my shame to go? and as for th2e, thou shalt be as one of the f2ols in Israel. Now therefore, I pray th2e, speak unto the king; for he wi2l not wit2hold me from th2e. 
Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her. 
Then Amnon hated her exc2edingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone. 
And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her. 
Then he ca2led his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the d2or after her. 
And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins a2pare2led. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the d2or after her. 
And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying. 
And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother b2en with th2e? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house. 
But when king David heard of a2l these things, he was very wroth. 
And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither g2od nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar. 
And it came to pa2s after two fu2l years, that Absalom had sh2epshearers in B2alhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited a2l the king's sons. 
And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sh2epshearers; let the king, I bes2ech th2e, and his servants go with thy servant. 
And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not a2l now go, lest we be chargeable unto th2e. And he pre2sed him: howbeit he would not go, but ble2sed him. 
Then said Absalom, If not, I pray th2e, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with th2e? 
But Absalom pre2sed him, that he let Amnon and a2l the king's sons go with him. 
Now Absalom had co2manded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is me2ry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then ki2l him, fear not: have not I co2manded you? be courageous, and be valiant. 
And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had co2manded. Then a2l the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled. 
And it came to pa2s, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain a2l the king's sons, and there is not one of them left. 
Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and a2l his servants st2od by with their clothes rent. 
And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord su2pose that they have slain a2l the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the a2pointment of Absalom this hath b2en determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar. 
Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that a2l the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead. 
But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and l2oked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hi2l side behind him. 
And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, so it is. 
And it came to pa2s, as s2on as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and a2l his servants wept very sore. 
But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of A2mihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day. 
So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there thr2e years. 
And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, s2eing he was dead. 
Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom. 
And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray th2e, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning a2parel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead: 
And come to the king, and speak on this ma2ner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth. 
And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fe2l on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king. 
And the king said unto her, What aileth th2e? And she answered, I am ind2ed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead. 
And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him. 
And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may ki2l him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we wi2l destroy the heir also: and so they sha2l quench my coal which is left, and sha2l not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth. 
And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I wi2l give charge concerning th2e. 
And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltle2s. 
And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto th2e, bring him to me, and he sha2l not touch th2e any more. 
Then said she, I pray th2e, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not su2fer the revengers of bl2od to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there sha2l not one hair of thy son fa2l to the earth. 
Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray th2e, speak one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on. 
And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished. 
For we must n2eds die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which ca2not be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expe2led from him. 
Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I wi2l now speak unto the king; it may be that the king wi2l perform the request of his handmaid. 
For the king wi2l hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God. 
Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king sha2l now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern g2od and bad: therefore the LORD thy God wi2l be with th2e. 
Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray th2e, the thing that I sha2l ask th2e. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak. 
And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with th2e in a2l this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put a2l these words in the mouth of thine handmaid: 
To fetch about this form of sp2ech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, a2cording to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know a2l things that are in the earth. 
And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again. 
And Joab fe2l to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfi2led the request of his servant. 
So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. 
And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not s2e my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face. 
But in a2l Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his f2ot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. 
And when he po2led his head, (for it was at every year's end that he po2led it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he po2led it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight. 
And unto Absalom there were born thr2e sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance. 
So Absalom dwelt two fu2l years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face. 
Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come. 
Therefore he said unto his servants, S2e, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire. 
Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire? 
And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto th2e, saying, Come hither, that I may send th2e to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had b2en g2od for me to have b2en there sti2l: now therefore let me s2e the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him ki2l me. 
So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had ca2led for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king ki2sed Absalom. 
And it came to pa2s after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him. 
And Absalom rose up early, and st2od beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom ca2led unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel. 
And Absalom said unto him, S2e, thy ma2ters are g2od and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear th2e. 
Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice! 
And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and t2ok him, and ki2sed him. 
And on this ma2ner did Absalom to a2l Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel. 
And it came to pa2s after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray th2e, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron. 
For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD sha2l bring me again ind2ed to Jerusalem, then I wi2l serve the LORD. 
And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron. 
But Absalom sent spies throughout a2l the tribes of Israel, saying, As s2on as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye sha2l say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron. 
And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were ca2led; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing. 
And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counse2lor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he o2fered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continua2ly with Absalom. 
And there came a me2senger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom. 
And David said unto a2l his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us fl2e; for we sha2l not else escape from Absalom: make sp2ed to depart, lest he overtake us su2denly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword. 
And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king sha2l a2point. 
And the king went forth, and a2l his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to k2ep the house. 
And the king went forth, and a2l the people after him, and ta2ried in a place that was far o2f. 
And a2l his servants pa2sed on beside him; and a2l the Cherethites, and a2l the Pelethites, and a2l the Gi2tites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, pa2sed on before the king. 
Then said the king to I2tai the Gi2tite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger, and also an exile. 
Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make th2e go up and down with us? s2eing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with th2e. 
And I2tai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king sha2l be, whether in death or life, even there also wi2l thy servant be. 
And David said to I2tai, Go and pa2s over. And I2tai the Gi2tite pa2sed over, and a2l his men, and a2l the li2tle ones that were with him. 
And a2l the country wept with a loud voice, and a2l the people pa2sed over: the king also himself pa2sed over the br2ok Kidron, and a2l the people pa2sed over, toward the way of the wilderne2s. 
And lo Zadok also, and a2l the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until a2l the people had done pa2sing out of the city. 
And the king said unto Zadok, Ca2ry back the ark of God into the city: if I sha2l find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he wi2l bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation: 
But if he thus say, I have no delight in th2e; behold, here am I, let him do to me as s2emeth g2od unto him. 
The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a s2er? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahim2az thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. 
S2e, I wi2l ta2ry in the plain of the wilderne2s, until there come word from you to certify me. 
Zadok therefore and Abiathar ca2ried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they ta2ried there. 
And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went baref2ot: and a2l the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, w2eping as they went up. 
And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray th2e, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into f2olishne2s. 
And it came to pa2s, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshi2ped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to m2et him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head: 
Unto whom David said, If thou pa2sest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me: 
But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I wi2l be thy servant, O king; as I have b2en thy father's servant hitherto, so wi2l I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel. 
And hast thou not there with th2e Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it sha2l be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt te2l it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. 
Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahim2az Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye sha2l send unto me every thing that ye can hear. 
So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem. 
And when David was a li2tle past the top of the hi2l, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of a2ses sa2dled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of su2mer fruits, and a bo2tle of wine. 
And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The a2ses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and su2mer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderne2s may drink. 
And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day sha2l the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father. 
Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are a2l that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly bes2ech th2e that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king. 
And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed sti2l as he came. 
And he cast stones at David, and at a2l the servants of king David: and a2l the people and a2l the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. 
And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bl2ody man, and thou man of Belial: 
The LORD hath returned upon th2e a2l the bl2od of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bl2ody man. 
Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray th2e, and take o2f his head. 
And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who sha2l then say, Wherefore hast thou done so? 
And David said to Abishai, and to a2l his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, s2eketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bi2den him. 
It may be that the LORD wi2l l2ok on mine a2fliction, and that the LORD wi2l requite me g2od for his cursing this day. 
And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hi2l's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. 
And the king, and a2l the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there. 
And Absalom, and a2l the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. 
And it came to pa2s, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king. 
And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindne2s to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend? 
And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and a2l the men of Israel, ch2ose, his wi2l I be, and with him wi2l I abide. 
And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so wi2l I be in thy presence. 
Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we sha2l do. 
And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to k2ep the house; and a2l Israel sha2l hear that thou art abho2red of thy father: then sha2l the hands of a2l that are with th2e be strong. 
So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of a2l Israel. 
And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counse2led in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was a2l the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom. 
Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now ch2ose out twelve thousand men, and I wi2l arise and pursue after David this night: 
And I wi2l come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and wi2l make him afraid: and a2l the people that are with him sha2l fl2e; and I wi2l smite the king only: 
And I wi2l bring back a2l the people unto th2e: the man whom thou s2ekest is as if a2l returned: so a2l the people sha2l be in peace. 
And the saying pleased Absalom we2l, and a2l the elders of Israel. 
Then said Absalom, Ca2l now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith. 
And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this ma2ner: sha2l we do after his saying? if not; speak thou. 
And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not g2od at this time. 
For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear ro2bed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and wi2l not lodge with the people. 
Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it wi2l come to pa2s, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it wi2l say, There is a slaughter among the people that fo2low Absalom. 
And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, sha2l u2terly melt: for a2l Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men. 
Therefore I counsel that a2l Israel be genera2ly gathered unto th2e, from Dan even to B2ersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to ba2tle in thine own person. 
So sha2l we come upon him in some place where he sha2l be found, and we wi2l light upon him as the dew fa2leth on the ground: and of him and of a2l the men that are with him there sha2l not be left so much as one. 
Moreover, if he be go2ten into a city, then sha2l a2l Israel bring ropes to that city, and we wi2l draw it into the river, until there be not one sma2l stone found there. 
And Absalom and a2l the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is be2ter than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had a2pointed to defeat the g2od counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom. 
Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counse2led. 
Now therefore send quickly, and te2l David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderne2s, but sp2edily pa2s over; lest the king be swa2lowed up, and a2l the people that are with him. 
Now Jonathan and Ahim2az stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be s2en to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David. 
Neverthele2s a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a we2l in his court; whither they went down. 
And the woman t2ok and spread a covering over the we2l's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known. 
And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahim2az and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the br2ok of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem. 
And it came to pa2s, after they were departed, that they came up out of the we2l, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pa2s quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counse2led against you. 
Then David arose, and a2l the people that were with him, and they pa2sed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan. 
And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not fo2lowed, he sa2dled his a2s, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father. 
Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom pa2sed over Jordan, he and a2l the men of Israel with him. 
And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother. 
So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead. 
And it came to pa2s, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Ra2bah of the children of A2mon, and Machir the son of A2miel of Lodebar, and Barzi2lai the Gileadite of Rogelim, 
Brought beds, and basons, and earthen ve2sels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and parched pulse, 
And honey, and bu2ter, and sh2ep, and ch2ese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderne2s. 
And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them. 
And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of I2tai the Gi2tite. And the king said unto the people, I wi2l surely go forth with you myself also. 
But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we fl2e away, they wi2l not care for us; neither if half of us die, wi2l they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is be2ter that thou su2cour us out of the city. 
And the king said unto them, What s2emeth you best I wi2l do. And the king st2od by the gate side, and a2l the people came out by hundreds and by thousands. 
And the king co2manded Joab and Abishai and I2tai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And a2l the people heard when the king gave a2l the captains charge concerning Absalom. 
So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the ba2tle was in the w2od of Ephraim; 
Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men. 
For the ba2tle was there sca2tered over the face of a2l the country: and the w2od devoured more people that day than the sword devoured. 
And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up betw2en the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away. 
And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak. 
And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given th2e ten shekels of silver, and a girdle. 
And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged th2e and Abishai and I2tai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom. 
Otherwise I should have wrought falseh2od against mine own life: for there is no ma2ter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me. 
Then said Joab, I may not ta2ry thus with th2e. And he t2ok thr2e darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak. 
And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compa2sed about and smote Absalom, and slew him. 
And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people. 
And they t2ok Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the w2od, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and a2l Israel fled every one to his tent. 
Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pi2lar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to k2ep my name in remembrance: and he ca2led the pi2lar after his own name: and it is ca2led unto this day, Absalom's place. 
Then said Ahim2az the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies. 
And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead. 
Then said Joab to Cushi, Go te2l the king what thou hast s2en. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran. 
Then said Ahim2az the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray th2e, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, s2eing that thou hast no tidings ready? 
But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahim2az ran by the way of the plain, and ove2ran Cushi. 
And David sat betw2en the two gates: and the watchman went up to the r2of over the gate unto the wa2l, and lifted up his eyes, and l2oked, and behold a man ru2ning alone. 
And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near. 
And the watchman saw another man ru2ning: and the watchman ca2led unto the porter, and said, Behold another man ru2ning alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings. 
And the watchman said, Me thinketh the ru2ning of the foremost is like the ru2ning of Ahim2az the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a g2od man, and cometh with g2od tidings. 
And Ahim2az ca2led, and said unto the king, A2l is we2l. And he fe2l down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Ble2sed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king. 
And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahim2az answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was. 
And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and st2od sti2l. 
And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged th2e this day of a2l them that rose up against th2e. 
And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and a2l that rise against th2e to do th2e hurt, be as that young man is. 
And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for th2e, O Absalom, my son, my son! 
And it was told Joab, Behold, the king w2epeth and mourneth for Absalom. 
And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto a2l the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son. 
And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they fl2e in ba2tle. 
But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son! 
And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of a2l thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines; 
In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and a2l we had died this day, then it had pleased th2e we2l. 
Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there wi2l not ta2ry one with th2e this night: and that wi2l be worse unto th2e than a2l the evil that befe2l th2e from thy youth until now. 
Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto a2l the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And a2l the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent. 
And a2l the people were at strife throughout a2l the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom. 
And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in ba2tle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back? 
And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? s2eing the sp2ech of a2l Israel is come to the king, even to his house. 
Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king? 
And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continua2ly in the r2om of Joab. 
And he bowed the heart of a2l the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and a2l thy servants. 
So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to m2et the king, to conduct the king over Jordan. 
And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to m2et king David. 
And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fift2en sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king. 
And there went over a fe2ry boat to ca2ry over the king's household, and to do what he thought g2od. And Shimei the son of Gera fe2l down before the king, as he was come over Jordan; 
And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart. 
For thy servant doth know that I have si2ned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of a2l the house of Joseph to go down to m2et my lord the king. 
But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Sha2l not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's anointed? 
And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? sha2l there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel? 
Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him. 
And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to m2et the king, and had neither dre2sed his f2et, nor tri2med his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace. 
And it came to pa2s, when he was come to Jerusalem to m2et the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth? 
And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I wi2l sa2dle me an a2s, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame. 
And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is g2od in thine eyes. 
For a2l of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king? 
And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy ma2ters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land. 
And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take a2l, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house. 
And Barzi2lai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan. 
Now Barzi2lai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man. 
And the king said unto Barzi2lai, Come thou over with me, and I wi2l f2ed th2e with me in Jerusalem. 
And Barzi2lai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem? 
I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern betw2en g2od and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king? 
Thy servant wi2l go a li2tle way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward? 
Let thy servant, I pray th2e, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what sha2l s2em g2od unto th2e. 
And the king answered, Chimham sha2l go over with me, and I wi2l do to him that which sha2l s2em g2od unto th2e: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that wi2l I do for th2e. 
And a2l the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king ki2sed Barzi2lai, and ble2sed him; and he returned unto his own place. 
Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and a2l the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel. 
And, behold, a2l the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen th2e away, and have brought the king, and his household, and a2l David's men with him, over Jordan? 
And a2l the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this ma2ter? have we eaten at a2l of the king's cost? or hath he given us any gift? 
And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel. 
And there ha2pened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Je2se: every man to his tents, O Israel. 
So every man of Israel went up from after David, and fo2lowed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem. 
And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king t2ok the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to k2ep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowh2od. 
Then said the king to Amasa, A2semble me the men of Judah within thr2e days, and be thou here present. 
So Amasa went to a2semble the men of Judah: but he ta2ried longer than the set time which he had a2pointed him. 
And David said to Abishai, Now sha2l Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us. 
And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and a2l the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. 
When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fe2l out. 
And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab t2ok Amasa by the beard with the right hand to ki2s him. 
But Amasa t2ok no h2ed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri. 
And one of Joab's men st2od by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab. 
And Amasa wa2lowed in bl2od in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that a2l the people st2od sti2l, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him st2od sti2l. 
When he was removed out of the highway, a2l the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. 
And he went through a2l the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Bethm2achah, and a2l the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him. 
And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethm2achah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it st2od in the trench: and a2l the people that were with Joab ba2tered the wa2l, to throw it down. 
Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with th2e. 
And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear. 
Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They sha2l surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the ma2ter. 
I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou s2ekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swa2low up the inheritance of the LORD? 
And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swa2low up or destroy. 
The ma2ter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I wi2l depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head sha2l be thrown to th2e over the wa2l. 
Then the woman went unto a2l the people in her wisdom. And they cut o2f the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king. 
Now Joab was over a2l the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites: 
And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder: 
And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests: 
And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David. 
Then there was a famine in the days of David thr2e years, year after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bl2ody house, because he slew the Gibeonites. 
And the king ca2led the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.) 
Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What sha2l I do for you? and wherewith sha2l I make the atonement, that ye may ble2s the inheritance of the LORD? 
And the Gibeonites said unto him, We wi2l have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou ki2l any man in Israel. And he said, What ye sha2l say, that wi2l I do for you. 
And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel, 
Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we wi2l hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD did ch2ose. And the king said, I wi2l give them. 
But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was betw2en them, betw2en David and Jonathan the son of Saul. 
But the king t2ok the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzi2lai the Meholathite: 
And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hi2l before the LORD: and they fe2l a2l seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the begi2ning of barley harvest. 
And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah t2ok sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the begi2ning of harvest until water dro2ped upon them out of heaven, and su2fered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night. 
And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done. 
And David went and t2ok the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the str2et of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa: 
And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged. 
And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed a2l that the king co2manded. And after that God was intreated for the land. 
Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint. 
And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed thr2e hundred shekels of bra2s in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David. 
But Abishai the son of Zeruiah su2coured him, and smote the Philistine, and ki2led him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to ba2tle, that thou quench not the light of Israel. 
And it came to pa2s after this, that there was again a ba2tle with the Philistines at Gob: then Si2bechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant. 
And there was again a ba2tle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of J2areoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gi2tite, the sta2f of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. 
And there was yet a ba2tle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every f2ot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant. 
And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him. 
These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fe2l by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. 
And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of a2l his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul: 
And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortre2s, and my deliverer; 
The God of my rock; in him wi2l I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence. 
I wi2l ca2l on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so sha2l I be saved from mine enemies. 
When the waves of death compa2sed me, the fl2ods of ungodly men made me afraid; 
The so2rows of he2l compa2sed me about; the snares of death prevented me; 
In my distre2s I ca2led upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears. 
Then the earth sh2ok and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and sh2ok, because he was wroth. 
There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. 
He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkne2s was under his f2et. 
And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was s2en upon the wings of the wind. 
And he made darkne2s pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies. 
Through the brightne2s before him were coals of fire kindled. 
The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High u2tered his voice. 
And he sent out a2rows, and sca2tered them; lightning, and discomfited them. 
And the cha2nels of the sea a2peared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils. 
He sent from above, he t2ok me; he drew me out of many waters; 
He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were t2o strong for me. 
They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay. 
He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me. 
The LORD rewarded me a2cording to my righteousne2s: a2cording to the clea2ne2s of my hands hath he recompensed me. 
For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God. 
For a2l his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them. 
I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity. 
Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me a2cording to my righteousne2s; a2cording to my clea2ne2s in his eye sight. 
With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright. 
With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury. 
And the a2flicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down. 
For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD wi2l lighten my darkne2s. 
For by th2e I have run through a tr2op: by my God have I leaped over a wa2l. 
As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to a2l them that trust in him. 
For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God? 
God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect. 
He maketh my f2et like hinds' f2et: and se2teth me upon my high places. 
He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of st2el is broken by mine arms. 
Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentlene2s hath made me great. 
Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my f2et did not slip. 
I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them. 
And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fa2len under my f2et. 
For thou hast girded me with strength to ba2tle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me. 
Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me. 
They l2oked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not. 
Then did I beat them as sma2l as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the str2et, and did spread them abroad. 
Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not sha2l serve me. 
Strangers sha2l submit themselves unto me: as s2on as they hear, they sha2l be obedient unto me. 
Strangers sha2l fade away, and they sha2l be afraid out of their close places. 
The LORD liveth; and ble2sed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation. 
It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me. 
And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man. 
Therefore I wi2l give thanks unto th2e, O LORD, among the heathen, and I wi2l sing praises unto thy name. 
He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his s2ed for evermore. 
Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Je2se said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sw2et psalmist of Israel, said, 
The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue. 
The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God. 
And he sha2l be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender gra2s springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain. 
Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in a2l things, and sure: for this is a2l my salvation, and a2l my desire, although he make it not to grow. 
But the sons of Belial sha2l be a2l of them as thorns thrust away, because they ca2not be taken with hands: 
But the man that sha2l touch them must be fenced with iron and the sta2f of a spear; and they sha2l be u2terly burned with fire in the same place. 
These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time. 
And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the thr2e mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to ba2tle, and the men of Israel were gone away: 
He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil. 
And after him was Sha2mah the son of Ag2e the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a tr2op, where was a piece of ground fu2l of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines. 
But he st2od in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory. 
And thr2e of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adu2lam: and the tr2op of the Philistines pitched in the va2ley of Rephaim. 
And David was then in an hold, and the ga2rison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem. 
And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the we2l of Bethlehem, which is by the gate! 
And the thr2e mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the we2l of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and t2ok it, and brought it to David: neverthele2s he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD. 
And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the bl2od of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these thr2e mighty men. 
And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among thr2e. And he lifted up his spear against thr2e hundred, and slew them, and had the name among thr2e. 
Was he not most honourable of thr2e? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he a2tained not unto the first thr2e. 
And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabz2el, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow: 
And he slew an Egyptian, a g2odly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a sta2f, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. 
These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among thr2e mighty men. 
He was more honourable than the thirty, but he a2tained not to the first thr2e. And David set him over his guard. 
Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 
Sha2mah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite, 
Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of I2kesh the Tekoite, 
Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebu2nai the Hushathite, 
Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, 
Heleb the son of B2anah, a Netophathite, I2tai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, 
Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hi2dai of the br2oks of G2ash, 
Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite, 
Eliahba the Sh2albonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan, 
Sha2mah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite, 
Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the M2achathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite, 
Hezrai the Carmelite, P2arai the Arbite, 
Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite, 
Zelek the A2monite, Nahari the B2erothite, armourbearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah, 
Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite, 
Uriah the Hi2tite: thirty and seven in a2l. 
And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah. 
For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now through a2l the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to B2ersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people. 
And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God a2d unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may s2e it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing? 
Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel. 
And they pa2sed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer: 
Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danj2an, and about to Zidon, 
And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to a2l the cities of the Hivites, and of the Can2anites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to B2ersheba. 
So when they had gone through a2l the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. 
And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men. 
And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have si2ned greatly in that I have done: and now, I bes2ech th2e, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very f2olishly. 
For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's s2er, saying, 
Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I o2fer th2e thr2e things; ch2ose th2e one of them, that I may do it unto th2e. 
So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Sha2l seven years of famine come unto th2e in thy land? or wilt thou fl2e thr2e months before thine enemies, while they pursue th2e? or that there be thr2e days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and s2e what answer I sha2l return to him that sent me. 
And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fa2l now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fa2l into the hand of man. 
So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time a2pointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to B2ersheba seventy thousand men. 
And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite. 
And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have si2ned, and I have done wickedly: but these sh2ep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray th2e, be against me, and against my father's house. 
And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfl2or of Araunah the Jebusite. 
And David, a2cording to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD co2manded. 
And Araunah l2oked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground. 
And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfl2or of th2e, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people. 
And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and o2fer up what s2emeth g2od unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for w2od. 
A2l these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God a2cept th2e. 
And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I wi2l surely buy it of th2e at a price: neither wi2l I o2fer burnt o2ferings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfl2or and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. 
And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and o2fered burnt o2ferings and peace o2ferings. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel. 
Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. 
Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat. 
So they sought for a fair damsel throughout a2l the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shuna2mite, and brought her to the king. 
And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not. 
Then Adonijah the son of Ha2gith exalted himself, saying, I wi2l be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. 
And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very g2odly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom. 
And he confe2red with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they fo2lowing Adonijah helped him. 
But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah. 
And Adonijah slew sh2ep and oxen and fat ca2tle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and ca2led a2l his brethren the king's sons, and a2l the men of Judah the king's servants: 
But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he ca2led not. 
Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Ha2gith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not? 
Now therefore come, let me, I pray th2e, give th2e counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon. 
Go and get th2e in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, A2suredly Solomon thy son sha2l reign after me, and he sha2l sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign? 
Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also wi2l come in after th2e, and confirm thy words. 
And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shuna2mite ministered unto the king. 
And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou? 
And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, A2suredly Solomon thy son sha2l reign after me, and he sha2l sit upon my throne. 
And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not: 
And he hath slain oxen and fat ca2tle and sh2ep in abundance, and hath ca2led a2l the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not ca2led. 
And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of a2l Israel are upon th2e, that thou shouldest te2l them who sha2l sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 
Otherwise it sha2l come to pa2s, when my lord the king sha2l sl2ep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon sha2l be counted o2fenders. 
And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in. 
And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. 
And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah sha2l reign after me, and he sha2l sit upon my throne? 
For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat ca2tle and sh2ep in abundance, and hath ca2led a2l the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah. 
But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not ca2led. 
Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him? 
Then king David answered and said, Ca2l me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and st2od before the king. 
And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath red2emed my soul out of a2l distre2s, 
Even as I sware unto th2e by the LORD God of Israel, saying, A2suredly Solomon thy son sha2l reign after me, and he sha2l sit upon my throne in my stead; even so wi2l I certainly do this day. 
Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever. 
And king David said, Ca2l me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king. 
The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon: 
And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon. 
Then ye sha2l come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he sha2l be king in my stead: and I have a2pointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah. 
And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so t2o. 
As the LORD hath b2en with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David. 
So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon. 
And Zadok the priest t2ok an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and a2l the people said, God save king Solomon. 
And a2l the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them. 
And Adonijah and a2l the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar? 
And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest g2od tidings. 
And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king. 
And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule: 
And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard. 
And also Solomon si2teth on the throne of the kingdom. 
And moreover the king's servants came to ble2s our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon be2ter than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed. 
And also thus said the king, Ble2sed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even s2eing it. 
And a2l the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way. 
And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 
And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he wi2l not slay his servant with the sword. 
And Solomon said, If he wi2l shew himself a worthy man, there sha2l not an hair of him fa2l to the earth: but if wickedne2s sha2l be found in him, he sha2l die. 
So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house. 
Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying, 
I go the way of a2l the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man; 
And k2ep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to k2ep his statutes, and his co2mandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is wri2ten in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in a2l that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself: 
That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take h2ed to their way, to walk before me in truth with a2l their heart and with a2l their soul, there sha2l not fail th2e (said he) a man on the throne of Israel. 
Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the bl2od of war in peace, and put the bl2od of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his f2et. 
Do therefore a2cording to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace. 
But shew kindne2s unto the sons of Barzi2lai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother. 
And, behold, thou hast with th2e Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to m2et me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I wi2l not put th2e to death with the sword. 
Now therefore hold him not guiltle2s: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with bl2od. 
So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. 
And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and thr2e years reigned he in Jerusalem. 
Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly. 
And Adonijah the son of Ha2gith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably. 
He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto th2e. And she said, Say on. 
And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that a2l Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD. 
And now I ask one petition of th2e, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on. 
And he said, Speak, I pray th2e, unto Solomon the king, (for he wi2l not say th2e nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shuna2mite to wife. 
And Bathsheba said, We2l; I wi2l speak for th2e unto the king. 
Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to m2et her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. 
Then she said, I desire one sma2l petition of th2e; I pray th2e, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I wi2l not say th2e nay. 
And she said, Let Abishag the Shuna2mite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife. 
And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shuna2mite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah. 
Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life. 
Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah sha2l be put to death this day. 
And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fe2l upon him that he died. 
And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get th2e to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I wi2l not at this time put th2e to death, because thou barest the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and because thou hast b2en a2flicted in a2l wherein my father was a2flicted. 
So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh. 
Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 
And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fa2l upon him. 
And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I wi2l die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me. 
And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fa2l upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the i2nocent bl2od, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father. 
And the LORD sha2l return his bl2od upon his own head, who fe2l upon two men more righteous and be2ter than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah. 
Their bl2od sha2l therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his s2ed for ever: but upon David, and upon his s2ed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, sha2l there be peace for ever from the LORD. 
So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fe2l upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderne2s. 
And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his r2om over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the r2om of Abiathar. 
And the king sent and ca2led for Shimei, and said unto him, Build th2e an house in Jerusalem, and dwe2l there, and go not forth thence any whither. 
For it sha2l be, that on the day thou goest out, and pa2sest over the br2ok Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy bl2od sha2l be upon thine own head. 
And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is g2od: as my lord the king hath said, so wi2l thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days. 
And it came to pa2s at the end of thr2e years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of M2achah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath. 
And Shimei arose, and sa2dled his a2s, and went to Gath to Achish to s2ek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath. 
And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again. 
And the king sent and ca2led for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make th2e to swear by the LORD, and protested unto th2e, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is g2od. 
Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the co2mandment that I have charged th2e with? 
The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest a2l the wickedne2s which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD sha2l return thy wickedne2s upon thine own head; 
And king Solomon sha2l be ble2sed, and the throne of David sha2l be established before the LORD for ever. 
So the king co2manded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fe2l upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon. 
And Solomon made a2finity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and t2ok Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wa2l of Jerusalem round about. 
Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days. 
And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places. 
And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt o2ferings did Solomon o2fer upon that altar. 
In Gibeon the LORD a2peared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I sha2l give th2e. 
And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, a2cording as he walked before th2e in truth, and in righteousne2s, and in uprightne2s of heart with th2e; and thou hast kept for him this great kindne2s, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day. 
And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a li2tle child: I know not how to go out or come in. 
And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that ca2not be numbered nor counted for multitude. 
Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern betw2en g2od and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people? 
And the sp2ech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing. 
And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment; 
Behold, I have done a2cording to thy words: lo, I have given th2e a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like th2e before th2e, neither after th2e sha2l any arise like unto th2e. 
And I have also given th2e that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there sha2l not be any among the kings like unto th2e a2l thy days. 
And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to k2ep my statutes and my co2mandments, as thy father David did walk, then I wi2l lengthen thy days. 
And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and st2od before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and o2fered up burnt o2ferings, and o2fered peace o2ferings, and made a feast to a2l his servants. 
Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and st2od before him. 
And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwe2l in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house. 
And it came to pa2s the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house. 
And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it. 
And she arose at midnight, and t2ok my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. 
And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear. 
And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king. 
Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living. 
And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king. 
And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other. 
Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it. 
Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof. 
And a2l Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment. 
So king Solomon was king over a2l Israel. 
And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest, 
Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder. 
And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests: 
And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the o2ficers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal o2ficer, and the king's friend: 
And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute. 
And Solomon had twelve o2ficers over a2l Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision. 
And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim: 
The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Sh2albim, and Bethshemesh, and Elonbet2hanan: 
The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and a2l the land of Hepher: 
The son of Abinadab, in a2l the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife: 
B2ana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained T2anach and Megi2do, and a2l Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezr2el, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam: 
The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Mana2seh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, thr2escore great cities with wa2ls and brasen bars: 
Ahinadab the son of I2do had Mahanaim: 
Ahim2az was in Naphtali; he also t2ok Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife: 
B2anah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth: 
Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in I2sachar: 
Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin: 
Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only o2ficer which was in the land. 
Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making me2ry. 
And Solomon reigned over a2l kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon a2l the days of his life. 
And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and thr2escore measures of meal, 
Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sh2ep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fa2lowd2er, and fa2ted fowl. 
For he had dominion over a2l the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to A2zah, over a2l the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on a2l sides round about him. 
And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tr2e, from Dan even to B2ersheba, a2l the days of Solomon. 
And Solomon had forty thousand sta2ls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. 
And those o2ficers provided victual for king Solomon, and for a2l that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing. 
Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the o2ficers were, every man a2cording to his charge. 
And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exc2eding much, and largene2s of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore. 
And Solomon's wisdom exce2led the wisdom of a2l the children of the east country, and a2l the wisdom of Egypt. 
For he was wiser than a2l men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in a2l nations round about. 
And he spake thr2e thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. 
And he spake of tr2es, from the cedar tr2e that is in Lebanon even unto the hy2sop that springeth out of the wa2l: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of cr2eping things, and of fishes. 
And there came of a2l people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from a2l kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom. 
And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the r2om of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David. 
And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 
Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his f2et. 
But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil o2cu2rent. 
And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I wi2l set upon thy throne in thy r2om, he sha2l build an house unto my name. 
Now therefore co2mand thou that they hew me cedar tr2es out of Lebanon; and my servants sha2l be with thy servants: and unto th2e wi2l I give hire for thy servants a2cording to a2l that thou shalt a2point: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can ski2l to hew timber like unto the Sidonians. 
And it came to pa2s, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Ble2sed be the LORD this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people. 
And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I wi2l do a2l thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir. 
My servants sha2l bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I wi2l convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt a2point me, and wi2l cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt a2complish my desire, in giving f2od for my household. 
So Hiram gave Solomon cedar tr2es and fir tr2es a2cording to a2l his desire. 
And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for f2od to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year. 
And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace betw2en Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together. 
And king Solomon raised a levy out of a2l Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men. 
And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy. 
And Solomon had thr2escore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains; 
Beside the chief of Solomon's o2ficers which were over the work, thr2e thousand and thr2e hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work. 
And the king co2manded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house. 
And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house. 
And it came to pa2s in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD. 
And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was thr2escore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits. 
And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, a2cording to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house. 
And for the house he made windows of na2row lights. 
And against the wa2l of the house he built chambers round about, against the wa2ls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about: 
The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the mi2dle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wa2l of the house he made na2rowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the wa2ls of the house. 
And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither ha2mer nor axe nor any t2ol of iron heard in the house, while it was in building. 
The d2or for the mi2dle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the mi2dle chamber, and out of the mi2dle into the third. 
So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar. 
And then he built chambers against a2l the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar. 
And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying, 
Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and k2ep a2l my co2mandments to walk in them; then wi2l I perform my word with th2e, which I spake unto David thy father: 
And I wi2l dwe2l among the children of Israel, and wi2l not forsake my people Israel. 
So Solomon built the house, and finished it. 
And he built the wa2ls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the fl2or of the house, and the wa2ls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with w2od, and covered the fl2or of the house with planks of fir. 
And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the fl2or and the wa2ls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place. 
And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long. 
And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: a2l was cedar; there was no stone s2en. 
And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD. 
And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar. 
So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold. 
And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished a2l the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold. 
And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tr2e, each ten cubits high. 
And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the u2termost part of the one wing unto the u2termost part of the other were ten cubits. 
And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size. 
The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub. 
And he set the cherubims within the i2ner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wa2l, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wa2l; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house. 
And he overlaid the cherubims with gold. 
And he carved a2l the wa2ls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm tr2es and open flowers, within and without. 
And the fl2ors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without. 
And for the entering of the oracle he made d2ors of olive tr2e: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wa2l. 
The two d2ors also were of olive tr2e; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm tr2es and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm tr2es. 
So also made he for the d2or of the temple posts of olive tr2e, a fourth part of the wa2l. 
And the two d2ors were of fir tr2e: the two leaves of the one d2or were folding, and the two leaves of the other d2or were folding. 
And he carved thereon cherubims and palm tr2es and open flowers: and covered them with gold fi2ted upon the carved work. 
And he built the i2ner court with thr2e rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams. 
In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif: 
And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout a2l the parts thereof, and a2cording to a2l the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it. 
But Solomon was building his own house thirt2en years, and he finished a2l his house. 
He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pi2lars, with cedar beams upon the pi2lars. 
And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pi2lars, fift2en in a row. 
And there were windows in thr2e rows, and light was against light in thr2e ranks. 
And a2l the d2ors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in thr2e ranks. 
And he made a porch of pi2lars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pi2lars and the thick beam were before them. 
Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the fl2or to the other. 
And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch. 
A2l these were of costly stones, a2cording to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court. 
And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits. 
And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars. 
And the great court round about was with thr2e rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the i2ner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house. 
And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. 
He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in bra2s: and he was fi2led with wisdom, and understanding, and cu2ning to work a2l works in bra2s. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought a2l his work. 
For he cast two pi2lars of bra2s, of eight2en cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compa2s either of them about. 
And he made two chapiters of molten bra2s, to set upon the tops of the pi2lars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits: 
And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pi2lars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter. 
And he made the pi2lars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter. 
And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pi2lars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits. 
And the chapiters upon the two pi2lars had pomegranates also above, over against the be2ly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter. 
And he set up the pi2lars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pi2lar, and ca2led the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pi2lar, and ca2led the name thereof Boaz. 
And upon the top of the pi2lars was lily work: so was the work of the pi2lars finished. 
And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round a2l about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compa2s it round about. 
And under the brim of it round about there were knops compa2sing it, ten in a cubit, compa2sing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast. 
It st2od upon twelve oxen, thr2e l2oking toward the north, and thr2e l2oking toward the west, and thr2e l2oking toward the south, and thr2e l2oking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and a2l their hinder parts were inward. 
And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths. 
And he made ten bases of bra2s; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and thr2e cubits the height of it. 
And the work of the bases was on this ma2ner: they had borders, and the borders were betw2en the ledges: 
And on the borders that were betw2en the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain a2ditions made of thin work. 
And every base had four brasen wh2els, and plates of bra2s: and the four corners thereof had underse2ters: under the laver were underse2ters molten, at the side of every a2dition. 
And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round. 
And under the borders were four wh2els; and the axletr2es of the wh2els were joined to the base: and the height of a wh2el was a cubit and half a cubit. 
And the work of the wh2els was like the work of a chariot wh2el: their axletr2es, and their naves, and their fe2loes, and their spokes, were a2l molten. 
And there were four underse2ters to the four corners of one base: and the underse2ters were of the very base itself. 
And in the top of the base was there a round compa2s of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same. 
For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm tr2es, a2cording to the proportion of every one, and a2ditions round about. 
After this ma2ner he made the ten bases: a2l of them had one casting, one measure, and one size. 
Then made he ten lavers of bra2s: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver. 
And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south. 
And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing a2l the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD: 
The two pi2lars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pi2lars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pi2lars; 
And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pi2lars; 
And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases; 
And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea; 
And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and a2l these ve2sels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright bra2s. 
In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground betw2en Su2coth and Zarthan. 
And Solomon left a2l the ve2sels unweighed, because they were exc2eding many: neither was the weight of the bra2s found out. 
And Solomon made a2l the ve2sels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was, 
And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold, 
And the bowls, and the snu2fers, and the basons, and the sp2ons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the d2ors of the i2ner house, the most holy place, and for the d2ors of the house, to wit, of the temple. 
So was ended a2l the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the ve2sels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD. 
Then Solomon a2sembled the elders of Israel, and a2l the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion. 
And a2l the men of Israel a2sembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. 
And a2l the elders of Israel came, and the priests t2ok up the ark. 
And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and a2l the holy ve2sels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up. 
And king Solomon, and a2l the congregation of Israel, that were a2sembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sh2ep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude. 
And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims. 
For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above. 
And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were s2en out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not s2en without: and there they are unto this day. 
There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. 
And it came to pa2s, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud fi2led the house of the LORD, 
So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had fi2led the house of the LORD. 
Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwe2l in the thick darkne2s. 
I have surely built th2e an house to dwe2l in, a se2tled place for th2e to abide in for ever. 
And the king turned his face about, and ble2sed a2l the congregation of Israel: (and a2l the congregation of Israel st2od;) 
And he said, Ble2sed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfi2led it, saying, 
Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of a2l the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel. 
And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel. 
And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst we2l that it was in thine heart. 
Neverthele2s thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that sha2l come forth out of thy loins, he sha2l build the house unto my name. 
And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the r2om of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel. 
And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. 
And Solomon st2od before the altar of the LORD in the presence of a2l the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven: 
And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like th2e, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who k2epest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before th2e with a2l their heart: 
Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfi2led it with thine hand, as it is this day. 
Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, k2ep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There sha2l not fail th2e a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take h2ed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me. 
And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray th2e, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father. 
But wi2l God ind2ed dwe2l on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens ca2not contain th2e; how much le2s this house that I have builded? 
Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his su2plication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before th2e to day: 
That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name sha2l be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant sha2l make toward this place. 
And hearken thou to the su2plication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they sha2l pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwe2ling place: and when thou hearest, forgive. 
If any man trespa2s against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house: 
Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him a2cording to his righteousne2s. 
When thy people Israel be smi2ten down before the enemy, because they have si2ned against th2e, and sha2l turn again to th2e, and confe2s thy name, and pray, and make su2plication unto th2e in this house: 
Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers. 
When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have si2ned against th2e; if they pray toward this place, and confe2s thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou a2flictest them: 
Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the g2od way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance. 
If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpi2ler; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickne2s there be; 
What prayer and su2plication soever be made by any man, or by a2l thy people Israel, which sha2l know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house: 
Then hear thou in heaven thy dwe2ling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man a2cording to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of a2l the children of men;) 
That they may fear th2e a2l the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers. 
Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake; 
(For they sha2l hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he sha2l come and pray toward this house; 
Hear thou in heaven thy dwe2ling place, and do a2cording to a2l that the stranger ca2leth to th2e for: that a2l people of the earth may know thy name, to fear th2e, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is ca2led by thy name. 
If thy people go out to ba2tle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and sha2l pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy name: 
Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their su2plication, and maintain their cause. 
If they sin against th2e, (for there is no man that si2neth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they ca2ry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near; 
Yet if they sha2l bethink themselves in the land whither they were ca2ried captives, and repent, and make su2plication unto th2e in the land of them that ca2ried them captives, saying, We have si2ned, and have done perversely, we have co2mi2ted wickedne2s; 
And so return unto th2e with a2l their heart, and with a2l their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto th2e toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name: 
Then hear thou their prayer and their su2plication in heaven thy dwe2ling place, and maintain their cause, 
And forgive thy people that have si2ned against th2e, and a2l their transgre2sions wherein they have transgre2sed against th2e, and give them compa2sion before them who ca2ried them captive, that they may have compa2sion on them: 
For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron: 
That thine eyes may be open unto the su2plication of thy servant, and unto the su2plication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in a2l that they ca2l for unto th2e. 
For thou didst separate them from among a2l the people of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD God. 
And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying a2l this prayer and su2plication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kn2eling on his kn2es with his hands spread up to heaven. 
And he st2od, and ble2sed a2l the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying, 
Ble2sed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, a2cording to a2l that he promised: there hath not failed one word of a2l his g2od promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant. 
The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us: 
That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in a2l his ways, and to k2ep his co2mandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he co2manded our fathers. 
And let these my words, wherewith I have made su2plication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at a2l times, as the ma2ter sha2l require: 
That a2l the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else. 
Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to k2ep his co2mandments, as at this day. 
And the king, and a2l Israel with him, o2fered sacrifice before the LORD. 
And Solomon o2fered a sacrifice of peace o2ferings, which he o2fered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sh2ep. So the king and a2l the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD. 
The same day did the king ha2low the mi2dle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he o2fered burnt o2ferings, and meat o2ferings, and the fat of the peace o2ferings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD was t2o li2tle to receive the burnt o2ferings, and meat o2ferings, and the fat of the peace o2ferings. 
And at that time Solomon held a feast, and a2l Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourt2en days. 
On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they ble2sed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for a2l the g2odne2s that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people. 
And it came to pa2s, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and a2l Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do, 
That the LORD a2peared to Solomon the second time, as he had a2peared unto him at Gibeon. 
And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy su2plication, that thou hast made before me: I have ha2lowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart sha2l be there perpetua2ly. 
And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightne2s, to do a2cording to a2l that I have co2manded th2e, and wilt k2ep my statutes and my judgments: 
Then I wi2l establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There sha2l not fail th2e a man upon the throne of Israel. 
But if ye sha2l at a2l turn from fo2lowing me, ye or your children, and wi2l not k2ep my co2mandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them: 
Then wi2l I cut o2f Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have ha2lowed for my name, wi2l I cast out of my sight; and Israel sha2l be a proverb and a byword among a2l people: 
And at this house, which is high, every one that pa2seth by it sha2l be astonished, and sha2l hi2s; and they sha2l say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house? 
And they sha2l answer, Because they fors2ok the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshi2ped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them a2l this evil. 
And it came to pa2s at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house, 
(Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar tr2es and fir tr2es, and with gold, a2cording to a2l his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galil2e. 
And Hiram came out from Tyre to s2e the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not. 
And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he ca2led them the land of Cabul unto this day. 
And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold. 
And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Mi2lo, and the wa2l of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megi2do, and Gezer. 
For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Can2anites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife. 
And Solomon built Gezer, and Bet2horon the nether, 
And B2alath, and Tadmor in the wilderne2s, in the land, 
And a2l the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in a2l the land of his dominion. 
And a2l the people that were left of the Amorites, Hi2tites, Peri2zites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel, 
Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able u2terly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day. 
But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen. 
These were the chief of the o2ficers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work. 
But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Mi2lo. 
And thr2e times in a year did Solomon o2fer burnt o2ferings and peace o2ferings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house. 
And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom. 
And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon. 
And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon. 
And when the qu2en of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions. 
And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she co2muned with him of a2l that was in her heart. 
And Solomon told her a2l her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not. 
And when the qu2en of Sheba had s2en a2l Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built, 
And the meat of his table, and the si2ting of his servants, and the a2tendance of his ministers, and their a2parel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her. 
And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom. 
Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had s2en it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exc2edeth the fame which I heard. 
Ha2py are thy men, ha2py are these thy servants, which stand continua2ly before th2e, and that hear thy wisdom. 
Ble2sed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in th2e, to set th2e on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he th2e king, to do judgment and justice. 
And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the qu2en of Sheba gave to king Solomon. 
And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug tr2es, and precious stones. 
And the king made of the almug tr2es pi2lars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug tr2es, nor were s2en unto this day. 
And king Solomon gave unto the qu2en of Sheba a2l her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants. 
Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred thr2escore and six talents of gold, 
Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the tra2fick of the spice merchants, and of a2l the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country. 
And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target. 
And he made thr2e hundred shields of beaten gold; thr2e pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. 
Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold. 
The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions st2od beside the stays. 
And twelve lions st2od there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom. 
And a2l king Solomon's drinking ve2sels were of gold, and a2l the ve2sels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing a2counted of in the days of Solomon. 
For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in thr2e years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. 
So king Solomon exc2eded a2l the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom. 
And a2l the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. 
And they brought every man his present, ve2sels of silver, and ve2sels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. 
And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem. 
And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore tr2es that are in the vale, for abundance. 
And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price. 
And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for a2l the kings of the Hi2tites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means. 
But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, A2monites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hi2tites: 
Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Ye sha2l not go in to them, neither sha2l they come in unto you: for surely they wi2l turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love. 
And he had seven hundred wives, prince2ses, and thr2e hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart. 
For it came to pa2s, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father. 
For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the go2de2s of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the A2monites. 
And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fu2ly after the LORD, as did David his father. 
Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hi2l that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of A2mon. 
And likewise did he for a2l his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods. 
And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had a2peared unto him twice, 
And had co2manded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD co2manded. 
Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of th2e, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have co2manded th2e, I wi2l surely rend the kingdom from th2e, and wi2l give it to thy servant. 
Notwithstanding in thy days I wi2l not do it for David thy father's sake: but I wi2l rend it out of the hand of thy son. 
Howbeit I wi2l not rend away a2l the kingdom; but wi2l give one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen. 
And the LORD sti2red up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's s2ed in Edom. 
For it came to pa2s, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smi2ten every male in Edom; 
(For six months did Joab remain there with a2l Israel, until he had cut o2f every male in Edom:) 
That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a li2tle child. 
And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they t2ok men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and a2pointed him victuals, and gave him land. 
And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the qu2en. 
And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh. 
And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country. 
Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou s2ekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise. 
And God sti2red him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah: 
And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus. 
And he was an adversary to Israel a2l the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abho2red Israel, and reigned over Syria. 
And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king. 
And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Mi2lo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father. 
And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon s2eing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over a2l the charge of the house of Joseph. 
And it came to pa2s at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field: 
And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces: 
And he said to Jeroboam, Take th2e ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I wi2l rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and wi2l give ten tribes to th2e: 
(But he sha2l have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of a2l the tribes of Israel:) 
Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshi2ped Ashtoreth the go2de2s of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of A2mon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to k2ep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father. 
Howbeit I wi2l not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I wi2l make him prince a2l the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my co2mandments and my statutes: 
But I wi2l take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and wi2l give it unto th2e, even ten tribes. 
And unto his son wi2l I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there. 
And I wi2l take th2e, and thou shalt reign a2cording to a2l that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel. 
And it sha2l be, if thou wilt hearken unto a2l that I co2mand th2e, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to k2ep my statutes and my co2mandments, as David my servant did; that I wi2l be with th2e, and build th2e a sure house, as I built for David, and wi2l give Israel unto th2e. 
And I wi2l for this a2flict the s2ed of David, but not for ever. 
Solomon sought therefore to ki2l Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon. 
And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and a2l that he did, and his wisdom, are they not wri2ten in the b2ok of the acts of Solomon? 
And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over a2l Israel was forty years. 
And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead. 
And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for a2l Israel were come to Shechem to make him king. 
And it came to pa2s, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;) 
That they sent and ca2led him. And Jeroboam and a2l the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying, 
Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we wi2l serve th2e. 
And he said unto them, Depart yet for thr2e days, then come again to me. And the people departed. 
And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that st2od before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people? 
And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak g2od words to them, then they wi2l be thy servants for ever. 
But he fors2ok the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which st2od before him: 
And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter? 
And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto th2e, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My li2tle finger sha2l be thicker than my father's loins. 
And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I wi2l a2d to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I wi2l chastise you with scorpions. 
So Jeroboam and a2l the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had a2pointed, saying, Come to me again the third day. 
And the king answered the people roughly, and fors2ok the old men's counsel that they gave him; 
And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I wi2l a2d to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I wi2l chastise you with scorpions. 
Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 
So when a2l Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Je2se: to your tents, O Israel: now s2e to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents. 
But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. 
Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and a2l Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made sp2ed to get him up to his chariot, to fl2e to Jerusalem. 
So Israel rebe2led against the house of David unto this day. 
And it came to pa2s, when a2l Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and ca2led him unto the congregation, and made him king over a2l Israel: there was none that fo2lowed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only. 
And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he a2sembled a2l the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were wa2riors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. 
But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying, 
Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto a2l the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying, 
Thus saith the LORD, Ye sha2l not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, a2cording to the word of the LORD. 
Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel. 
And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now sha2l the kingdom return to the house of David: 
If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then sha2l the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they sha2l ki2l me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah. 
Whereupon the king t2ok counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, It is t2o much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought th2e up out of the land of Egypt. 
And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan. 
And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan. 
And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi. 
And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fift2enth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he o2fered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made. 
So he o2fered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fift2enth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he o2fered upon the altar, and burnt incense. 
And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam st2od by the altar to burn incense. 
And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child sha2l be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon th2e sha2l he o2fer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon th2e, and men's bones sha2l be burnt upon th2e. 
And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar sha2l be rent, and the ashes that are upon it sha2l be poured out. 
And it came to pa2s, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pu2l it in again to him. 
The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, a2cording to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD. 
And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before. 
And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I wi2l give th2e a reward. 
And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I wi2l not go in with th2e, neither wi2l I eat bread nor drink water in this place: 
For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest. 
So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel. 
Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him a2l the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father. 
And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had s2en what way the man of God went, which came from Judah. 
And he said unto his sons, Sa2dle me the a2s. So they sa2dled him the a2s: and he rode thereon, 
And went after the man of God, and found him si2ting under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am. 
Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread. 
And he said, I may not return with th2e, nor go in with th2e: neither wi2l I eat bread nor drink water with th2e in this place: 
For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest. 
He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with th2e into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him. 
So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water. 
And it came to pa2s, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back: 
And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the co2mandment which the LORD thy God co2manded th2e, 
But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the Lord did say to th2e, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase sha2l not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers. 
And it came to pa2s, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he sa2dled for him the a2s, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back. 
And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the a2s st2od by it, the lion also st2od by the carcase. 
And, behold, men pa2sed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt. 
And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, a2cording to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him. 
And he spake to his sons, saying, Sa2dle me the a2s. And they sa2dled him. 
And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the a2s and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the a2s. 
And the prophet t2ok up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon the a2s, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him. 
And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother! 
And it came to pa2s, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones: 
For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against a2l the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, sha2l surely come to pa2s. 
After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places. 
And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it o2f, and to destroy it from o2f the face of the earth. 
At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fe2l sick. 
And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray th2e, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get th2e to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people. 
And take with th2e ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he sha2l te2l th2e what sha2l become of the child. 
And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not s2e; for his eyes were set by reason of his age. 
And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of th2e for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it sha2l be, when she cometh in, that she sha2l feign herself to be another woman. 
And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her f2et, as she came in at the d2or, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to th2e with heavy tidings. 
Go, te2l Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted th2e from among the people, and made th2e prince over my people Israel, 
And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it th2e: and yet thou hast not b2en as my servant David, who kept my co2mandments, and who fo2lowed me with a2l his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes; 
But hast done evil above a2l that were before th2e: for thou hast gone and made th2e other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back: 
Therefore, behold, I wi2l bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and wi2l cut o2f from Jeroboam him that pi2seth against the wa2l, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and wi2l take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, ti2l it be a2l gone. 
Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city sha2l the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field sha2l the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken it. 
Arise thou therefore, get th2e to thine own house: and when thy f2et enter into the city, the child sha2l die. 
And a2l Israel sha2l mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam sha2l come to the grave, because in him there is found some g2od thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam. 
Moreover the LORD sha2l raise him up a king over Israel, who sha2l cut o2f the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now. 
For the LORD sha2l smite Israel, as a r2ed is shaken in the water, and he sha2l r2ot up Israel out of this g2od land, which he gave to their fathers, and sha2l sca2ter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger. 
And he sha2l give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin. 
And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the threshold of the d2or, the child died; 
And they buried him; and a2l Israel mourned for him, a2cording to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet. 
And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he wa2red, and how he reigned, behold, they are wri2ten in the b2ok of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 
And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead. 
And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sevent2en years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did ch2ose out of a2l the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was N2amah an A2monite2s. 
And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had co2mi2ted, above a2l that their fathers had done. 
For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hi2l, and under every gr2en tr2e. 
And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did a2cording to a2l the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. 
And it came to pa2s in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem: 
And he t2ok away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he even t2ok away a2l: and he t2ok away a2l the shields of gold which Solomon had made. 
And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and co2mi2ted them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the d2or of the king's house. 
And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD, that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber. 
Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and a2l that he did, are they not wri2ten in the b2ok of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
And there was war betw2en Rehoboam and Jeroboam a2l their days. 
And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was N2amah an A2monite2s. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead. 
Now in the eight2enth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah. 
Thr2e years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother's name was M2achah, the daughter of Abishalom. 
And he walked in a2l the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father. 
Neverthele2s for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem: 
Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he co2manded him a2l the days of his life, save only in the ma2ter of Uriah the Hi2tite. 
And there was war betw2en Rehoboam and Jeroboam a2l the days of his life. 
Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and a2l that he did, are they not wri2ten in the b2ok of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war betw2en Abijam and Jeroboam. 
And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. 
And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah. 
And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was M2achah, the daughter of Abishalom. 
And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did David his father. 
And he t2ok away the sodomites out of the land, and removed a2l the idols that his fathers had made. 
And also M2achah his mother, even her he removed from being qu2en, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the br2ok Kidron. 
But the high places were not removed: neverthele2s Asa's heart was perfect with the LORD a2l his days. 
And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and ve2sels. 
And there was war betw2en Asa and B2asha king of Israel a2l their days. 
And B2asha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not su2fer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 
Then Asa t2ok a2l the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, 
There is a league betw2en me and th2e, and betw2en my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto th2e a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with B2asha king of Israel, that he may depart from me. 
So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethm2achah, and a2l Ci2neroth, with a2l the land of Naphtali. 
And it came to pa2s, when B2asha heard thereof, that he left o2f building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah. 
Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout a2l Judah; none was exempted: and they t2ok away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith B2asha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah. 
The rest of a2l the acts of Asa, and a2l his might, and a2l that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not wri2ten in the b2ok of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Neverthele2s in the time of his old age he was diseased in his f2et. 
And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead. 
And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years. 
And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin. 
And B2asha the son of Ahijah, of the house of I2sachar, conspired against him; and B2asha smote him at Gi2bethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and a2l Israel laid siege to Gi2bethon. 
Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did B2asha slay him, and reigned in his stead. 
And it came to pa2s, when he reigned, that he smote a2l the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, a2cording unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite: 
Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he si2ned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger. 
Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and a2l that he did, are they not wri2ten in the b2ok of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
And there was war betw2en Asa and B2asha king of Israel a2l their days. 
In the third year of Asa king of Judah began B2asha the son of Ahijah to reign over a2l Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years. 
And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin. 
Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against B2asha, saying, 
Forasmuch as I exalted th2e out of the dust, and made th2e prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins; 
Behold, I wi2l take away the posterity of B2asha, and the posterity of his house; and wi2l make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 
Him that dieth of B2asha in the city sha2l the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields sha2l the fowls of the air eat. 
Now the rest of the acts of B2asha, and what he did, and his might, are they not wri2ten in the b2ok of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
So B2asha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead. 
And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against B2asha, and against his house, even for a2l the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he ki2led him. 
In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of B2asha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years. 
And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah. 
And Zimri went in and smote him, and ki2led him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead. 
And it came to pa2s, when he began to reign, as s2on as he sat on his throne, that he slew a2l the house of B2asha: he left him not one that pi2seth against a wa2l, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends. 
Thus did Zimri destroy a2l the house of B2asha, a2cording to the word of the LORD, which he spake against B2asha by Jehu the prophet. 
For a2l the sins of B2asha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they si2ned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities. 
Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and a2l that he did, are they not wri2ten in the b2ok of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against Gi2bethon, which belonged to the Philistines. 
And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore a2l Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp. 
And Omri went up from Gi2bethon, and a2l Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah. 
And it came to pa2s, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died. 
For his sins which he si2ned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin. 
Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not wri2ten in the b2ok of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people fo2lowed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half fo2lowed Omri. 
But the people that fo2lowed Omri prevailed against the people that fo2lowed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned. 
In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah. 
And he bought the hi2l Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hi2l, and ca2led the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hi2l, Samaria. 
But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than a2l that were before him. 
For he walked in a2l the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities. 
Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he shewed, are they not wri2ten in the b2ok of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead. 
And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years. 
And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above a2l that were before him. 
And it came to pa2s, as if it had b2en a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he t2ok to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethb2al king of the Zidonians, and went and served B2al, and worshi2ped him. 
And he reared up an altar for B2al in the house of B2al, which he had built in Samaria. 
And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than a2l the kings of Israel that were before him. 
In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, a2cording to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun. 
And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there sha2l not be dew nor rain these years, but a2cording to my word. 
And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 
Get th2e hence, and turn th2e eastward, and hide thyself by the br2ok Cherith, that is before Jordan. 
And it sha2l be, that thou shalt drink of the br2ok; and I have co2manded the ravens to f2ed th2e there. 
So he went and did a2cording unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the br2ok Cherith, that is before Jordan. 
And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the br2ok. 
And it came to pa2s after a while, that the br2ok dried up, because there had b2en no rain in the land. 
And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 
Arise, get th2e to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwe2l there: behold, I have co2manded a widow woman there to sustain th2e. 
So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks: and he ca2led to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray th2e, a li2tle water in a ve2sel, that I may drink. 
And as she was going to fetch it, he ca2led to her, and said, Bring me, I pray th2e, a morsel of bread in thine hand. 
And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a ba2rel, and a li2tle oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dre2s it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die. 
And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a li2tle cake first, and bring it unto me, and after make for th2e and for thy son. 
For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The ba2rel of meal sha2l not waste, neither sha2l the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth. 
And she went and did a2cording to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days. 
And the ba2rel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, a2cording to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah. 
And it came to pa2s after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistre2s of the house, fe2l sick; and his sickne2s was so sore, that there was no breath left in him. 
And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with th2e, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to ca2l my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son? 
And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he t2ok him out of her bosom, and ca2ried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed. 
And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son? 
And he stretched himself upon the child thr2e times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray th2e, let this child's soul come into him again. 
And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived. 
And Elijah t2ok the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, S2e, thy son liveth. 
And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth. 
And it came to pa2s after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I wi2l send rain upon the earth. 
And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore famine in Samaria. 
And Ahab ca2led Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly: 
For it was so, when Jezebel cut o2f the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah t2ok an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.) 
And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto a2l fountains of water, and unto a2l br2oks: peradventure we may find gra2s to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not a2l the beasts. 
So they divided the land betw2en them to pa2s throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself. 
And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fe2l on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah? 
And he answered him, I am: go, te2l thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here. 
And he said, What have I si2ned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me? 
As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to s2ek th2e: and when they said, He is not there; he t2ok an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found th2e not. 
And now thou sayest, Go, te2l thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, as s2on as I am gone from th2e, that the Spirit of the LORD sha2l ca2ry th2e whither I know not; and so when I come and te2l Ahab, and he ca2not find th2e, he sha2l slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth. 
Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water? 
And now thou sayest, Go, te2l thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he sha2l slay me. 
And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I wi2l surely shew myself unto him to day. 
So Obadiah went to m2et Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to m2et Elijah. 
And it came to pa2s, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel? 
And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the co2mandments of the LORD, and thou hast fo2lowed B2alim. 
Now therefore send, and gather to me a2l Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of B2al four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table. 
So Ahab sent unto a2l the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel. 
And Elijah came unto a2l the people, and said, How long halt ye betw2en two opinions? if the LORD be God, fo2low him: but if B2al, then fo2low him. And the people answered him not a word. 
Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but B2al's prophets are four hundred and fifty men. 
Let them therefore give us two bu2locks; and let them ch2ose one bu2lock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on w2od, and put no fire under: and I wi2l dre2s the other bu2lock, and lay it on w2od, and put no fire under: 
And ca2l ye on the name of your gods, and I wi2l ca2l on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And a2l the people answered and said, It is we2l spoken. 
And Elijah said unto the prophets of B2al, Ch2ose you one bu2lock for yourselves, and dre2s it first; for ye are many; and ca2l on the name of your gods, but put no fire under. 
And they t2ok the bu2lock which was given them, and they dre2sed it, and ca2led on the name of B2al from morning even until n2on, saying, O B2al, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made. 
And it came to pa2s at n2on, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sl2epeth, and must be awaked. 
And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their ma2ner with knives and lancets, ti2l the bl2od gushed out upon them. 
And it came to pa2s, when mi2day was past, and they prophesied until the time of the o2fering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded. 
And Elijah said unto a2l the people, Come near unto me. And a2l the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down. 
And Elijah t2ok twelve stones, a2cording to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel sha2l be thy name: 
And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of s2ed. 
And he put the w2od in order, and cut the bu2lock in pieces, and laid him on the w2od, and said, Fi2l four ba2rels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the w2od. 
And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time. 
And the water ran round about the altar; and he fi2led the trench also with water. 
And it came to pa2s at the time of the o2fering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Is2ac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done a2l these things at thy word. 
Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again. 
Then the fire of the LORD fe2l, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the w2od, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. 
And when a2l the people saw it, they fe2l on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God. 
And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of B2al; let not one of them escape. And they t2ok them: and Elijah brought them down to the br2ok Kishon, and slew them there. 
And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get th2e up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain. 
So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face betw2en his kn2es, 
And said to his servant, Go up now, l2ok toward the sea. And he went up, and l2oked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times. 
And it came to pa2s at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a li2tle cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get th2e down that the rain stop th2e not. 
And it came to pa2s in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezr2el. 
And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezr2el. 
And Ahab told Jezebel a2l that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain a2l the prophets with the sword. 
Then Jezebel sent a me2senger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to mo2row about this time. 
And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to B2ersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there. 
But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderne2s, and came and sat down under a juniper tr2e: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not be2ter than my fathers. 
And as he lay and slept under a juniper tr2e, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat. 
And he l2oked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again. 
And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is t2o great for th2e. 
And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God. 
And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah? 
And he said, I have b2en very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they s2ek my life, to take it away. 
And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD pa2sed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake: 
And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a sti2l sma2l voice. 
And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wra2ped his face in his mantle, and went out, and st2od in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah? 
And he said, I have b2en very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they s2ek my life, to take it away. 
And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderne2s of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria: 
And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy r2om. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael sha2l Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu sha2l Elisha slay. 
Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, a2l the kn2es which have not bowed unto B2al, and every mouth which hath not ki2sed him. 
So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah pa2sed by him, and cast his mantle upon him. 
And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray th2e, ki2s my father and my mother, and then I wi2l fo2low th2e. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to th2e? 
And he returned back from him, and t2ok a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him. 
And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered a2l his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and wa2red against it. 
And he sent me2sengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad, 
Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the g2odliest, are mine. 
And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, a2cording to thy saying, I am thine, and a2l that I have. 
And the me2sengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto th2e, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children; 
Yet I wi2l send my servants unto th2e to mo2row about this time, and they sha2l search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it sha2l be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they sha2l put it in their hand, and take it away. 
Then the king of Israel ca2led a2l the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and s2e how this man s2eketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not. 
And a2l the elders and a2l the people said unto him, Hearken not unto him, nor consent. 
Wherefore he said unto the me2sengers of Benhadad, Te2l my lord the king, A2l that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I wi2l do: but this thing I may not do. And the me2sengers departed, and brought him word again. 
And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria sha2l su2fice for handfuls for a2l the people that fo2low me. 
And the king of Israel answered and said, Te2l him, Let not him that girdeth on his harne2s boast himself as he that pu2teth it o2f. 
And it came to pa2s, when Ben-hadad heard this me2sage, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set yourselves in a2ray. And they set themselves in a2ray against the city. 
And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou s2en a2l this great multitude? behold, I wi2l deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD. 
And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who sha2l order the ba2tle? And he answered, Thou. 
Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered a2l the people, even a2l the children of Israel, being seven thousand. 
And they went out at n2on. But Benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him. 
And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria. 
And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive. 
So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which fo2lowed them. 
And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen. 
And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter. 
And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and s2e what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria wi2l come up against th2e. 
And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods are gods of the hi2ls; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we sha2l be stronger than they. 
And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their r2oms: 
And number th2e an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we wi2l fight against them in the plain, and surely we sha2l be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so. 
And it came to pa2s at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel. 
And the children of Israel were numbered, and were a2l present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two li2tle flocks of kids; but the Syrians fi2led the country. 
And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is God of the hi2ls, but he is not God of the va2leys, therefore wi2l I deliver a2l this great multitude into thine hand, and ye sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so it was, that in the seventh day the ba2tle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand f2otmen in one day. 
But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wa2l fe2l upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an i2ner chamber. 
And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray th2e, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he wi2l save thy life. 
So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadad saith, I pray th2e, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother. 
Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot. 
And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father t2ok from thy father, I wi2l restore; and thou shalt make str2ets for th2e in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I wi2l send th2e away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away. 
And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray th2e. And the man refused to smite him. 
Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as s2on as thou art departed from me, a lion sha2l slay th2e. And as s2on as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him. 
Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray th2e. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him. 
So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face. 
And as the king pa2sed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the ba2tle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, K2ep this man: if by any means he be mi2sing, then sha2l thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver. 
And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So sha2l thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it. 
And he hasted, and t2ok the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets. 
And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I a2pointed to u2ter destruction, therefore thy life sha2l go for his life, and thy people for his people. 
And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria. 
And it came to pa2s after these things, that Naboth the Jezr2elite had a vineyard, which was in Jezr2el, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. 
And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I wi2l give th2e for it a be2ter vineyard than it; or, if it s2em g2od to th2e, I wi2l give th2e the worth of it in money. 
And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto th2e. 
And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezr2elite had spoken to him: for he had said, I wi2l not give th2e the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread. 
But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread? 
And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezr2elite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please th2e, I wi2l give th2e another vineyard for it: and he answered, I wi2l not give th2e my vineyard. 
And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be me2ry: I wi2l give th2e the vineyard of Naboth the Jezr2elite. 
So she wrote le2ters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the le2ters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwe2ling with Naboth. 
And she wrote in the le2ters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people: 
And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witne2s against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And then ca2ry him out, and stone him, that he may die. 
And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was wri2ten in the le2ters which she had sent unto them. 
They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people. 
And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witne2sed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they ca2ried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died. 
Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead. 
And it came to pa2s, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take po2se2sion of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezr2elite, which he refused to give th2e for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead. 
And it came to pa2s, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezr2elite, to take po2se2sion of it. 
And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 
Arise, go down to m2et Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to po2se2s it. 
And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou ki2led, and also taken po2se2sion? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the bl2od of Naboth sha2l dogs lick thy bl2od, even thine. 
And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found th2e: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD. 
Behold, I wi2l bring evil upon th2e, and wi2l take away thy posterity, and wi2l cut o2f from Ahab him that pi2seth against the wa2l, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, 
And wi2l make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of B2asha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin. 
And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs sha2l eat Jezebel by the wa2l of Jezr2el. 
Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs sha2l eat; and him that dieth in the field sha2l the fowls of the air eat. 
But there was none like unto Ahab, which did se2l himself to work wickedne2s in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife sti2red up. 
And he did very abominably in fo2lowing idols, a2cording to a2l things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. 
And it came to pa2s, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly. 
And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 
S2est thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I wi2l not bring the evil in his days: but in his son's days wi2l I bring the evil upon his house. 
And they continued thr2e years without war betw2en Syria and Israel. 
And it came to pa2s in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. 
And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be sti2l, and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria? 
And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to ba2tle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses. 
And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray th2e, at the word of the LORD to day. 
Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Sha2l I go against Ramothgilead to ba2tle, or sha2l I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD sha2l deliver it into the hand of the king. 
And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him? 
And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy g2od concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so. 
Then the king of Israel ca2led an o2ficer, and said, Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah. 
And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and a2l the prophets prophesied before them. 
And Zedekiah the son of Chen2anah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them. 
And a2l the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD sha2l deliver it into the king's hand. 
And the me2senger that was gone to ca2l Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare g2od unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray th2e, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is g2od. 
And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that wi2l I speak. 
So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, sha2l we go against Ramothgilead to ba2tle, or sha2l we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD sha2l deliver it into the hand of the king. 
And the king said unto him, How many times sha2l I adjure th2e that thou te2l me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD? 
And he said, I saw a2l Israel sca2tered upon the hi2ls, as sh2ep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace. 
And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not te2l th2e that he would prophesy no g2od concerning me, but evil? 
And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD si2ting on his throne, and a2l the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left. 
And the LORD said, Who sha2l persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fa2l at Ramothgilead? And one said on this ma2ner, and another said on that ma2ner. 
And there came forth a spirit, and st2od before the LORD, and said, I wi2l persuade him. 
And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I wi2l go forth, and I wi2l be a lying spirit in the mouth of a2l his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persude him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so. 
Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of a2l these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning th2e. 
But Zedekiah the son of Chen2anah went near, and smote Micaiah on the ch2ek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto th2e? 
And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt s2e in that day, when thou shalt go into an i2ner chamber to hide thyself. 
And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and ca2ry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; 
And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fe2low in the prison, and f2ed him with bread of a2fliction and with water of a2fliction, until I come in peace. 
And Micaiah said, If thou return at a2l in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you. 
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead. 
And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I wi2l disguise myself, and enter into the ba2tle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the ba2tle. 
But the king of Syria co2manded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with sma2l nor great, save only with the king of Israel. 
And it came to pa2s, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out. 
And it came to pa2s, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. 
And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel betw2en the joints of the harne2s: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and ca2ry me out of the host; for I am wounded. 
And the ba2tle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the bl2od ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot. 
And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country. 
So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria. 
And one washed the chariot in the p2ol of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his bl2od; and they washed his armour; a2cording unto the word of the LORD which he spake. 
Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and a2l that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and a2l the cities that he built, are they not wri2ten in the b2ok of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead. 
And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. 
Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
And he walked in a2l the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: neverthele2s the high places were not taken away; for the people o2fered and burnt incense yet in the high places. 
And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. 
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he wa2red, are they not wri2ten in the b2ok of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he t2ok out of the land. 
There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king. 
Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber. 
Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not. 
And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead. 
Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the sevent2enth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel. 
And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin: 
For he served B2al, and worshi2ped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, a2cording to a2l that his father had done.

Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was the firstborn; but forasmuch as he defiled his father's bed, his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.

And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish, and Nodab. 
And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and a2l that were with them: for they cried to God in the ba2tle, and he was intreated of them; because they put their trust in him. 
And they t2ok away their ca2tle; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sh2ep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of a2ses two thousand, and of men an hundred thousand. 
For there fe2l down many slain, because the war was of God. And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity. 
And the children of the half tribe of Mana2seh dwelt in the land: they increased from Bashan unto B2alhermon and Senir, and unto mount Hermon. 
And these were the heads of the house of their fathers, even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, and heads of the house of their fathers. 
And they transgre2sed against the God of their fathers, and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God destroyed before them. 
And the God of Israel sti2red up the spirit of Pul king of A2syria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of A2syria, and he ca2ried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Mana2seh, and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this day.

And Ahaz begat Jehoadah; and Jehoadah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza, 
And Moza begat Binea: Rapha was his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son: 
And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan. A2l these were the sons of Azel. 
And the sons of Eshek his brother were, Ulam his firstborn, Jehush the second, and Eliphelet the third. 
And the sons of Ulam were mighty men of valour, archers, and had many sons, and sons' sons, an hundred and fifty. A2l these are of the sons of Benjamin. 
So a2l Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they were wri2ten in the b2ok of the kings of Israel and Judah, who were ca2ried away to Babylon for their transgre2sion. 
Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their po2se2sions in their cities were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims. 
And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and Mana2seh; 
Uthai the son of A2mihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Pharez the son of Judah. 
And of the Shilonites; Asaiah the firstborn, and his sons.

And Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and Elah the son of U2zi, the son of Michri, and Meshu2lam the son of Shephathiah, the son of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah; 
And their brethren, a2cording to their generations, nine hundred and fifty and six. A2l these men were chief of the fathers in the house of their fathers. 
And of the priests; Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, and Jachin, 
And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshu2lam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God; 
And Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashur, the son of Malchijah, and M2asiai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah, the son of Meshu2lam, the son of Meshi2lemith, the son of I2mer; 
And their brethren, heads of the house of their fathers, a thousand and seven hundred and thr2escore; very able men for the work of the service of the house of God. 
And of the Levites; Shemaiah the son of Ha2shub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari; 
And Bakba2kar, Heresh, and Galal, and Ma2taniah the son of Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph; 
And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, that dwelt in the vi2lages of the Netophathites. 
And the porters were, Sha2lum, and A2kub, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brethren: Sha2lum was the chief; 
Who hitherto waited in the king's gate eastward: they were porters in the companies of the children of Levi. 
And Sha2lum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, k2epers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the host of the LORD, were k2epers of the entry. 
And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time past, and the LORD was with him. 
And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the d2or of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
A2l these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy in their vi2lages, whom David and Samuel the s2er did ordain in their set o2fice. 
So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of the LORD, namely, the house of the tabernacle, by wards. 
In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south. 
And their brethren, which were in their vi2lages, were to come after seven days from time to time with them. 
For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set o2fice, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God. 
And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning pertained to them. 
And certain of them had the charge of the ministering ve2sels, that they should bring them in and out by tale. 
Some of them also were a2pointed to overs2e the ve2sels, and a2l the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices. 
And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices. 
And Ma2tithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Sha2lum the Korahite, had the set o2fice over the things that were made in the pans. 
And other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, were over the shewbread, to prepare it every sa2bath. 
And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, who remaining in the chambers were fr2e: for they were employed in that work day and night. 
These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem. 
And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's name was M2achah: 
And his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and B2al, and Ner, and Nadab. 
And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth. 
And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their brethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren. 
And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshb2al. 
And the son of Jonathan was Meri2b2al: and Meri2b2al begat Micah. 
And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea, and Ahaz. 
And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza; 
And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son. 
And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan: these were the sons of Azel. 
Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fe2l down slain in mount Gilboa. 
And the Philistines fo2lowed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul. 
And the ba2tle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers. 
Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul t2ok a sword, and fe2l upon it. 
And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fe2l likewise on the sword, and died. 
So Saul died, and his thr2e sons, and a2l his house died together. 
And when a2l the men of Israel that were in the va2ley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they fors2ok their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. 
And it came to pa2s on the mo2row, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fa2len in mount Gilboa. 
And when they had stri2ped him, they t2ok his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to ca2ry tidings unto their idols, and to the people. 
And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon. 
And when a2l Jabeshgilead heard a2l that the Philistines had done to Saul, 
They arose, a2l the valiant men, and t2ok away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days. 
So Saul died for his transgre2sion which he co2mi2ted against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire of it; 
And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Je2se. 
Then a2l Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh. 
And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that le2dest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto th2e, Thou shalt f2ed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel. 
Therefore came a2l the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, a2cording to the word of the LORD by Samuel. 
And David and a2l Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land. 
And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Neverthele2s David t2ok the castle of Zion, which is the city of David. 
And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first sha2l be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief. 
And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they ca2led it the city of David. 
And he built the city round about, even from Mi2lo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city. 
So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was with him. 
These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with a2l Israel, to make him king, a2cording to the word of the LORD concerning Israel. 
And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against thr2e hundred slain by him at one time. 
And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the thr2e mighties. 
He was with David at Pasda2mim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to ba2tle, where was a parcel of ground fu2l of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines. 
And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great deliverance. 
Now thr2e of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adu2lam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the va2ley of Rephaim. 
And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' ga2rison was then at Bethlehem. 
And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the we2l of Bethlehem, that is at the gate! 
And the thr2e brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the we2l of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and t2ok it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD. 
And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: sha2l I drink the bl2od of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these thr2e mightiest. 
And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the thr2e: for lifting up his spear against thr2e hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the thr2e. 
Of the thr2e, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he a2tained not to the first thr2e. 
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabz2el, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day. 
And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a sta2f, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. 
These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the thr2e mighties. 
Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but a2tained not to the first thr2e: and David set him over his guard. 
Also the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 
Sha2moth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, 
Ira the son of I2kesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite, 
Si2becai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, 
Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of B2anah the Netophathite, 
Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, that pertained to the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite, 
Hurai of the br2oks of G2ash, Abiel the Arbathite, 
Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Sh2albonite, 
The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite, 
Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, 
Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, 
Hezro the Carmelite, N2arai the son of Ezbai, 
Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Ha2geri, 
Zelek the A2monite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah, 
Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 
Uriah the Hi2tite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, 
Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and thirty with him, 
Hanan the son of M2achah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite, 
U2zia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan the Aroerite, 
Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite, 
Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Eln2am, and Ithmah the Moabite, 
Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite. 
Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they were among the mighty men, helpers of the war. 
They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and sh2oting a2rows out of a bow, even of Saul's brethren of Benjamin. 
The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shem2ah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite. 
And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad the Gederathite, 
Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite, 
Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azar2el, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites, 
And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor. 
And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the hold to the wilderne2s men of might, and men of war fit for the ba2tle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the roes upon the mountains; 
Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, 
Mishma2nah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, 
A2tai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, 
Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, 
Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh. 
These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand. 
These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown a2l his banks; and they put to flight a2l them of the va2leys, both toward the east, and toward the west. 
And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David. 
And David went out to m2et them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart sha2l be knit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies, s2eing there is no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers l2ok thereon, and rebuke it. 
Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Je2se: peace, peace be unto th2e, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth th2e. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band. 
And there fe2l some of Mana2seh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to ba2tle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He wi2l fa2l to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads. 
As he went to Ziklag, there fe2l to him of Mana2seh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Mana2seh. 
And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they were a2l mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host. 
For at that time day by day there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God. 
And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, a2cording to the word of the LORD. 
The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war. 
Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one hundred. 
Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred. 
And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were thr2e thousand and seven hundred; 
And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father's house twenty and two captains. 
And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, thr2e thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul. 
And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers. 
And of the half tribe of Mana2seh eight2en thousand, which were expre2sed by name, to come and make David king. 
And of the children of I2sachar, which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and a2l their brethren were at their co2mandment. 
Of Zebulun, such as went forth to ba2tle, expert in war, with a2l instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could k2ep rank: they were not of double heart. 
And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand. 
And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred. 
And of Asher, such as went forth to ba2tle, expert in war, forty thousand. 
And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Mana2seh, with a2l ma2ner of instruments of war for the ba2tle, an hundred and twenty thousand. 
A2l these men of war, that could k2ep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over a2l Israel: and a2l the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king. 
And there they were with David thr2e days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them. 
Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto I2sachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on a2ses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sh2ep abundantly: for there was joy in Israel. 
And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader. 
And David said unto a2l the congregation of Israel, If it s2em g2od unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in a2l the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us: 
And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul. 
And a2l the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of a2l the people. 
So David gathered a2l Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim. 
And David went up, and a2l Israel, to B2alah, that is, to Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwe2leth betw2en the cherubims, whose name is ca2led on it. 
And they ca2ried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and U2za and Ahio drave the cart. 
And David and a2l Israel played before God with a2l their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. 
And when they came unto the threshingfl2or of Chidon, U2za put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. 
And the anger of the LORD was kindled against U2za, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God. 
And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon U2za: wherefore that place is ca2led Perezu2za to this day. 
And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How sha2l I bring the ark of God home to me? 
So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but ca2ried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gi2tite. 
And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house thr2e months. And the LORD ble2sed the house of Obededom, and a2l that he had. 
Now Hiram king of Tyre sent me2sengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house. 
And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel. 
And David t2ok more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters. 
Now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem; Sha2mua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, 
And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet, 
And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 
And Elishama, and B2eliada, and Eliphalet. 
And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over a2l Israel, a2l the Philistines went up to s2ek David. And David heard of it, and went out against them. 
And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the va2ley of Rephaim. 
And David enquired of God, saying, Sha2l I go up against the Philistines? And wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I wi2l deliver them into thine hand. 
So they came up to B2alperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they ca2led the name of that place B2alperazim. 
And when they had left their gods there, David gave a co2mandment, and they were burned with fire. 
And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the va2ley. 
Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulbe2ry tr2es. 
And it sha2l be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulbe2ry tr2es, that then thou shalt go out to ba2tle: for God is gone forth before th2e to smite the host of the Philistines. 
David therefore did as God co2manded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer. 
And the fame of David went out into a2l lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon a2l nations. 
And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent. 
Then David said, None ought to ca2ry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to ca2ry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever. 
And David gathered a2l Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it. 
And David a2sembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: 
Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty: 
Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty: 
Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief and his brethren an hundred and thirty: 
Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred: 
Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore: 
Of the sons of U2ziel; A2minadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve. 
And David ca2led for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and A2minadab, 
And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it. 
For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order. 
So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel. 
And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses co2manded a2cording to the word of the LORD. 
And David spake to the chief of the Levites to a2point their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy. 
So the Levites a2pointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 
And with them their brethren of the second degr2e, Zechariah, Ben, and J2aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and U2ni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and M2aseiah, and Ma2tithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters. 
So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were a2pointed to sound with cymbals of bra2s; 
And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and U2ni, and Eliab, and M2aseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth; 
And Ma2tithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel. 
And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful. 
And Berechiah and Elkanah were d2ork2epers for the ark. 
And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethan2el, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah were d2ork2epers for the ark. 
So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy. 
And it came to pa2s, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they o2fered seven bu2locks and seven rams. 
And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and a2l the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen. 
Thus a2l Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps. 
And it came to pa2s, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal, the daughter of Saul l2oking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart. 
So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they o2fered burnt sacrifices and peace o2ferings before God. 
And when David had made an end of o2fering the burnt o2ferings and the peace o2ferings, he ble2sed the people in the name of the LORD. 
And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a g2od piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. 
And he a2pointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel: 
Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Ma2tithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals; 
Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continua2ly before the ark of the covenant of God. 
Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren. 
Give thanks unto the LORD, ca2l upon his name, make known his d2eds among the people. 
Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of a2l his wondrous works. 
Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that s2ek the LORD. 
S2ek the LORD and his strength, s2ek his face continua2ly. 
Remember his marve2lous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; 
O ye s2ed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. 
He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in a2l the earth. 
Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he co2manded to a thousand generations; 
Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Is2ac; 
And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant, 
Saying, Unto th2e wi2l I give the land of Can2an, the lot of your inheritance; 
When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it. 
And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people; 
He su2fered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes, 
Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. 
Sing unto the LORD, a2l the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation. 
Declare his glory among the heathen; his marve2lous works among a2l nations. 
For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above a2l gods. 
For a2l the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made the heavens. 
Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladne2s are in his place. 
Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength. 
Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an o2fering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holine2s. 
Fear before him, a2l the earth: the world also sha2l be stable, that it be not moved. 
Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The LORD reigneth. 
Let the sea roar, and the fulne2s thereof: let the fields rejoice, and a2l that is therein. 
Then sha2l the tr2es of the w2od sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth. 
O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is g2od; for his mercy endureth for ever. 
And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise. 
Ble2sed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And a2l the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD. 
So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continua2ly, as every day's work required: 
And Obededom with their brethren, thr2escore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters: 
And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon, 
To o2fer burnt o2ferings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt o2fering continua2ly morning and evening, and to do a2cording to a2l that is wri2ten in the law of the LORD, which he co2manded Israel; 
And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expre2sed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever; 
And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters. 
And a2l the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to ble2s his house. 
Now it came to pa2s, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwe2l in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under curtains. 
Then Nathan said unto David, Do a2l that is in thine heart; for God is with th2e. 
And it came to pa2s the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, 
Go and te2l David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwe2l in: 
For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another. 
Wheresoever I have walked with a2l Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I co2manded to f2ed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars? 
Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I t2ok th2e from the sh2epcote, even from fo2lowing the sh2ep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel: 
And I have b2en with th2e whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut o2f a2l thine enemies from before th2e, and have made th2e a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth. 
Also I wi2l ordain a place for my people Israel, and wi2l plant them, and they sha2l dwe2l in their place, and sha2l be moved no more; neither sha2l the children of wickedne2s waste them any more, as at the begi2ning, 
And since the time that I co2manded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover I wi2l subdue a2l thine enemies. Furthermore I te2l th2e that the LORD wi2l build th2e an house. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I wi2l raise up thy s2ed after th2e, which sha2l be of thy sons; and I wi2l establish his kingdom. 
He sha2l build me an house, and I wi2l stablish his throne for ever. 
I wi2l be his father, and he sha2l be my son: and I wi2l not take my mercy away from him, as I t2ok it from him that was before th2e: 
But I wi2l se2tle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne sha2l be established for evermore. 
A2cording to a2l these words, and a2cording to a2l this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. 
And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? 
And yet this was a sma2l thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me a2cording to the estate of a man of high degr2e, O LORD God. 
What can David speak more to th2e for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant. 
O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and a2cording to thine own heart, hast thou done a2l this greatne2s, in making known a2l these great things. 
O LORD, there is none like th2e, neither is there any God beside th2e, a2cording to a2l that we have heard with our ears. 
And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to red2em to be his own people, to make th2e a name of greatne2s and te2riblene2s, by driving out nations from before thy people whom thou hast red2emed out of Egypt? 
For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God. 
Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said. 
Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before th2e. 
For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before th2e. 
And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this g2odne2s unto thy servant: 
Now therefore let it please th2e to ble2s the house of thy servant, that it may be before th2e for ever: for thou ble2sest, O LORD, and it sha2l be ble2sed for ever. 
Now after this it came to pa2s, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and t2ok Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines. 
And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts. 
And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates. 
And David t2ok from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand f2otmen: David also houghed a2l the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots. 
And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. 
Then David put ga2risons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. 
And David t2ok the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much bra2s, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pi2lars, and the ve2sels of bra2s. 
Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smi2ten a2l the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah; 
He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smi2ten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him a2l ma2ner of ve2sels of gold and silver and bra2s. 
Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from a2l these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of A2mon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek. 
Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the va2ley of salt eight2en thousand. 
And he put ga2risons in Edom; and a2l the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. 
So David reigned over a2l Israel, and executed judgment and justice among a2l his people. 
And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder. 
And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe; 
And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king. 
Now it came to pa2s after this, that Nahash the king of the children of A2mon died, and his son reigned in his stead. 
And David said, I wi2l shew kindne2s unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindne2s to me. And David sent me2sengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of A2mon to Hanun, to comfort him. 
But the princes of the children of A2mon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto th2e? are not his servants come unto th2e for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land? 
Wherefore Hanun t2ok David's servants, and shaved them, and cut o2f their garments in the midst hard by their bu2tocks, and sent them away. 
Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to m2et them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Ta2ry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return. 
And when the children of A2mon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of A2mon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriam2achah, and out of Zobah. 
So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of M2achah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of A2mon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to ba2tle. 
And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and a2l the host of the mighty men. 
And the children of A2mon came out, and put the ba2tle in a2ray before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field. 
Now when Joab saw that the ba2tle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of a2l the choice of Israel, and put them in a2ray against the Syrians. 
And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in a2ray against the children of A2mon. 
And he said, If the Syrians be t2o strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of A2mon be t2o strong for th2e, then I wi2l help th2e. 
Be of g2od courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is g2od in his sight. 
So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the ba2tle; and they fled before him. 
And when the children of A2mon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem. 
And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent me2sengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them. 
And it was told David; and he gathered a2l Israel, and pa2sed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the ba2tle in a2ray against them. So when David had put the ba2tle in a2ray against the Syrians, they fought with him. 
But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand f2otmen, and ki2led Shophach the captain of the host. 
And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of A2mon any more. 
And it came to pa2s, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to ba2tle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of A2mon, and came and besieged Ra2bah. But David ta2ried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Ra2bah, and destroyed it. 
And David t2ok the crown of their king from o2f his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exc2eding much spoil out of the city. 
And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with ha2rows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with a2l the cities of the children of A2mon. And David and a2l the people returned to Jerusalem. 
And it came to pa2s after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Si2bechai the Hushathite slew Si2pai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued. 
And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gi2tite, whose spear sta2f was like a weaver's beam. 
And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each f2ot and he also was the son of the giant. 
But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him. 
These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fe2l by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. 
And Satan st2od up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel. 
And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from B2ersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it. 
And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not a2l my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why wi2l he be a cause of trespa2s to Israel? 
Neverthele2s the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout a2l Israel, and came to Jerusalem. 
And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And a2l they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred thr2escore and ten thousand men that drew sword. 
But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab. 
And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel. 
And David said unto God, I have si2ned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I bes2ech th2e, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very f2olishly. 
And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's s2er, saying, 
Go and te2l David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I o2fer th2e thr2e things: ch2ose th2e one of them, that I may do it unto th2e. 
So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Ch2ose th2e 
Either thr2e years' famine; or thr2e months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh th2e; or else thr2e days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout a2l the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I sha2l bring again to him that sent me. 
And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fa2l now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fa2l into the hand of man. 
So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fe2l of Israel seventy thousand men. 
And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD st2od by the threshingfl2or of Ornan the Jebusite. 
And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand betw2en the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fe2l upon their faces. 
And David said unto God, Is it not I that co2manded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have si2ned and done evil ind2ed; but as for these sh2ep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray th2e, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued. 
Then the angel of the LORD co2manded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfl2or of Ornan the Jebusite. 
And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD. 
And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. 
And as David came to Ornan, Ornan l2oked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfl2or, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground. 
Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfl2or, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the fu2l price: that the plague may be stayed from the people. 
And Ornan said unto David, Take it to th2e, and let my lord the king do that which is g2od in his eyes: lo, I give th2e the oxen also for burnt o2ferings, and the threshing instruments for w2od, and the wheat for the meat o2fering; I give it a2l. 
And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I wi2l verily buy it for the fu2l price: for I wi2l not take that which is thine for the LORD, nor o2fer burnt o2ferings without cost. 
So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight. 
And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and o2fered burnt o2ferings and peace o2ferings, and ca2led upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt o2fering. 
And the LORD co2manded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof. 
At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfl2or of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. 
For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderne2s, and the altar of the burnt o2fering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon. 
But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD. 
Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt o2fering for Israel. 
And David co2manded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God. 
And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the d2ors of the gates, and for the joinings; and bra2s in abundance without weight; 
Also cedar tr2es in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar w2od to David. 
And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exc2eding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout a2l countries: I wi2l therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death. 
Then he ca2led for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel. 
And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God: 
But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed bl2od abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much bl2od upon the earth in my sight. 
Behold, a son sha2l be born to th2e, who sha2l be a man of rest; and I wi2l give him rest from a2l his enemies round about: for his name sha2l be Solomon, and I wi2l give peace and quietne2s unto Israel in his days. 
He sha2l build an house for my name; and he sha2l be my son, and I wi2l be his father; and I wi2l establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever. 
Now, my son, the LORD be with th2e; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of th2e. 
Only the LORD give th2e wisdom and understanding, and give th2e charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest k2ep the law of the LORD thy God. 
Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest h2ed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of g2od courage; dread not, nor be dismayed. 
Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of bra2s and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest a2d thereto. 
Moreover there are workmen with th2e in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and a2l ma2ner of cu2ning men for every ma2ner of work. 
Of the gold, the silver, and the bra2s, and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with th2e. 
David also co2manded a2l the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, 
Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people. 
Now set your heart and your soul to s2ek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy ve2sels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD. 
So when David was old and fu2l of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel. 
And he gathered together a2l the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. 
Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their po2ls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand. 
Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were o2ficers and judges: 
Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith. 
And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
Of the Gershonites were, L2adan, and Shimei. 
The sons of L2adan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, thr2e. 
The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, thr2e. These were the chief of the fathers of L2adan. 
And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei. 
And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, a2cording to their father's house. 
The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and U2ziel, four. 
The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to ble2s in his name for ever. 
Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi. 
The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer. 
Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief. 
And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. 
Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief. 
Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. 
Of the sons of U2ziel; Micah the first and Jesiah the second. 
The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish. 
And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish t2ok them. 
The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, thr2e. 
These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their po2ls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward. 
For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwe2l in Jerusalem for ever: 
And also unto the Levites; they sha2l no more ca2ry the tabernacle, nor any ve2sels of it for the service thereof. 
For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above: 
Because their o2fice was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of a2l holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God; 
Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat o2fering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for a2l ma2ner of measure and size; 
And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even: 
And to o2fer a2l burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sa2baths, in the new m2ons, and on the set feasts, by number, a2cording to the order co2manded unto them, continua2ly before the LORD: 
And that they should k2ep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD. 
Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's o2fice. 
And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, a2cording to their o2fices in their service. 
And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar, and thus were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar there were sixt2en chief men of the house of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar a2cording to the house of their fathers. 
Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. 
And Shemaiah the son of Nethan2el the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar. 
Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, 
The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, 
The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, 
The seventh to Ha2koz, the eighth to Abijah, 
The ninth to Jeshuah, the tenth to Shecaniah, 
The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, 
The thirt2enth to Hu2pah, the fourt2enth to Jeshebeab, 
The fift2enth to Bilgah, the sixt2enth to I2mer, 
The sevent2enth to Hezir, the eight2enth to Aphses, 
The ninet2enth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel, 
The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul, 
The thr2e and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to M2aziah. 
These were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, a2cording to their ma2ner, under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had co2manded him. 
And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah. 
Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was I2shiah. 
Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath. 
And the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth. 
Of the sons of U2ziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir. 
The brother of Michah was I2shiah: of the sons of I2shiah; Zechariah. 
The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of J2aziah; Beno. 
The sons of Merari by J2aziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Za2cur, and Ibri. 
Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons. 
Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahm2el. 
The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers. 
These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren. 
Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen a2cording to their service was: 
Of the sons of Asaph; Za2cur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which prophesied a2cording to the order of the king. 
Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Ma2tithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give thanks and to praise the LORD. 
Of Heman: the sons of Heman: Bu2kiah, Ma2taniah, U2ziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Gi2dalti, and Romamtiezer, Joshbekashah, Ma2lothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth: 
A2l these were the sons of Heman the king's s2er in the words of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourt2en sons and thr2e daughters. 
A2l these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God, a2cording to the king's order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman. 
So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the LORD, even a2l that were cu2ning, was two hundred fourscore and eight. 
And they cast lots, ward against ward, as we2l the sma2l as the great, the teacher as the scholar. 
Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second to Gedaliah, who with his brethren and sons were twelve: 
The third to Za2cur, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 
The fourth to Izri, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 
The fifth to Nethaniah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 
The sixth to Bu2kiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 
The seventh to Jesharelah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 
The eighth to Jeshaiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 
The ninth to Ma2taniah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 
The tenth to Shimei, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 
The eleventh to Azar2el, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 
The twelfth to Hashabiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 
The thirt2enth to Shubael, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 
The fourt2enth to Ma2tithiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 
The fift2enth to Jeremoth, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 
The sixt2enth to Hananiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 
The sevent2enth to Joshbekashah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 
The eight2enth to Hanani, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 
The ninet2enth to Ma2lothi, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 
The twentieth to Eliathah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 
The one and twentieth to Hothir, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 
The two and twentieth to Gi2dalti, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 
The thr2e and twentieth to Mahazioth, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: 
The four and twentieth to Romamtiezer, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve. 
Concerning the divisions of the porters: Of the Korhites was Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph. 
And the sons of Meshelemiah were, Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth, 
Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Elioenai the seventh. 
Moreover the sons of Obededom were, Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth, and Nethan2el the fifth. 
A2miel the sixth, I2sachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth: for God ble2sed him. 
Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled throughout the house of their father: for they were mighty men of valour. 
The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose brethren were strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah. 
A2l these of the sons of Obededom: they and their sons and their brethren, able men for strength for the service, were thr2escore and two of Obededom. 
And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, strong men, eight2en. 
Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the chief, (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him the chief;) 
Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth: a2l the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirt2en. 
Among these were the divisions of the porters, even among the chief men, having wards one against another, to minister in the house of the LORD. 
And they cast lots, as we2l the sma2l as the great, a2cording to the house of their fathers, for every gate. 
And the lot eastward fe2l to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counse2lor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward. 
To Obededom southward; and to his sons the house of Asu2pim. 
To Shu2pim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the gate Sha2lecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward against ward. 
Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and toward Asu2pim two and two. 
At Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar. 
These are the divisions of the porters among the sons of Kore, and among the sons of Merari. 
And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of the house of God, and over the treasures of the dedicated things. 
As concerning the sons of L2adan; the sons of the Gershonite L2adan, chief fathers, even of L2adan the Gershonite, were Jehieli. 
The sons of Jehieli; Zetham, and Joel his brother, which were over the treasures of the house of the LORD. 
Of the Amramites, and the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the U2zielites: 
And Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler of the treasures. 
And his brethren by Eliezer; Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son. 
Which Shelomith and his brethren were over a2l the treasures of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the chief fathers, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the host, had dedicated. 
Out of the spoils won in ba2tles did they dedicate to maintain the house of the LORD. 
And a2l that Samuel the s2er, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated; and whosoever had dedicated any thing, it was under the hand of Shelomith, and of his brethren. 
Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward busine2s over Israel, for o2ficers and judges. 
And of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, men of valour, a thousand and seven hundred, were o2ficers among them of Israel on this side Jordan westward in a2l the busine2s of the LORD, and in the service of the king. 
Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even among the Hebronites, a2cording to the generations of his fathers. In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for, and there were found among them mighty men of valour at Jazer of Gilead. 
And his brethren, men of valour, were two thousand and seven hundred chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Mana2seh, for every ma2ter pertaining to God, and a2fairs of the king. 
Now the children of Israel after their number, to wit, the chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and their o2ficers that served the king in any ma2ter of the courses, which came in and went out month by month throughout a2l the months of the year, of every course were twenty and four thousand. 
Over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
Of the children of Perez was the chief of a2l the captains of the host for the first month. 
And over the course of the second month was Dodai an Ahohite, and of his course was Mikloth also the ruler: in his course likewise were twenty and four thousand. 
The third captain of the host for the third month was Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, a chief priest: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
This is that Benaiah, who was mighty among the thirty, and above the thirty: and in his course was A2mizabad his son. 
The fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
The fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
The sixth captain for the sixth month was Ira the son of I2kesh the Tekoite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
The seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
The eighth captain for the eighth month was Si2becai the Hushathite, of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
The ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the Anetothite, of the Benjamites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
The tenth captain for the tenth month was Maharai the Netophathite, of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
The eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
The twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: the ruler of the Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri: of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of M2achah: 
Of the Levites, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel: of the Aaronites, Zadok: 
Of Judah, Elihu, one of the brethren of David: of I2sachar, Omri the son of Michael: 
Of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah: of Naphtali, Jerimoth the son of Azriel: 
Of the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Azaziah: of the half tribe of Mana2seh, Joel the son of Pedaiah: 
Of the half tribe of Mana2seh in Gilead, I2do the son of Zechariah: of Benjamin, J2asiel the son of Abner: 
Of Dan, Azar2el the son of Jeroham. These were the princes of the tribes of Israel. 
But David t2ok not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the LORD had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens. 
Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not, because there fe2l wrath for it against Israel; neither was the number put in the a2count of the chronicles of king David. 
And over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in the vi2lages, and in the castles, was Jehonathan the son of U2ziah: 
And over them that did the work of the field for ti2lage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub: 
And over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: over the increase of the vineyards for the wine ce2lars was Zabdi the Shiphmite: 
And over the olive tr2es and the sycomore tr2es that were in the low plains was B2alhanan the Gederite: and over the ce2lars of oil was Joash: 
And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the va2leys was Shaphat the son of Adlai: 
Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the a2ses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite: 
And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite. A2l these were the rulers of the substance which was king David's. 
Also Jonathan David's uncle was a counse2lor, a wise man, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's sons: 
And Ahithophel was the king's counse2lor: and Hushai the Archite was the king's companion: 
And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the general of the king's army was Joab. 
And David a2sembled a2l the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by course, and the captains over the thousands, and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over a2l the substance and po2se2sion of the king, and of his sons, with the o2ficers, and with the mighty men, and with a2l the valiant men, unto Jerusalem. 
Then David the king st2od up upon his f2et, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the f2otst2ol of our God, and had made ready for the building: 
But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because thou hast b2en a man of war, and hast shed bl2od. 
Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before a2l the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over a2l Israel: 
And of a2l my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel. 
And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he sha2l build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I wi2l be his father. 
Moreover I wi2l establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my co2mandments and my judgments, as at this day. 
Now therefore in the sight of a2l Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, k2ep and s2ek for a2l the co2mandments of the LORD your God: that ye may po2se2s this g2od land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever. 
And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a wi2ling mind: for the LORD searcheth a2l hearts, and understandeth a2l the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou s2ek him, he wi2l be found of th2e; but if thou forsake him, he wi2l cast th2e o2f for ever. 
Take h2ed now; for the LORD hath chosen th2e to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it. 
Then David gave to Solomon his son the pa2tern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the u2per chambers thereof, and of the i2ner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat, 
And the pa2tern of a2l that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of a2l the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things: 
Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for a2l the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for a2l the ve2sels of service in the house of the LORD. 
He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for a2l instruments of a2l ma2ner of service; silver also for a2l instruments of silver by weight, for a2l instruments of every kind of service: 
Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof, a2cording to the use of every candlestick. 
And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver: 
Also pure gold for the fles2h2oks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver: 
And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pa2tern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD. 
A2l this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even a2l the works of this pa2tern. 
And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of g2od courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my God, wi2l be with th2e; he wi2l not fail th2e, nor forsake th2e, until thou hast finished a2l the work for the service of the house of the LORD. 
And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they sha2l be with th2e for a2l the service of the house of God: and there sha2l be with th2e for a2l ma2ner of workmanship every wi2ling skilful man, for any ma2ner of service: also the princes and a2l the people wi2l be who2ly at thy co2mandment. 
Furthermore David the king said unto a2l the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God. 
Now I have prepared with a2l my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the bra2s for things of bra2s, the iron for things of iron, and w2od for things of w2od; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and a2l ma2ner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance. 
Moreover, because I have set my a2fection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper g2od, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above a2l that I have prepared for the holy house. 
Even thr2e thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the wa2ls of the houses withal: 
The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for a2l ma2ner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is wi2ling to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD? 
Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, o2fered wi2lingly, 
And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of bra2s eight2en thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron. 
And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. 
Then the people rejoiced, for that they o2fered wi2lingly, because with perfect heart they o2fered wi2lingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy. 
Wherefore David ble2sed the LORD before a2l the congregation: and David said, Ble2sed be thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever. 
Thine, O LORD is the greatne2s, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for a2l that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above a2l. 
Both riches and honour come of th2e, and thou reignest over a2l; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto a2l. 
Now therefore, our God, we thank th2e, and praise thy glorious name. 
But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to o2fer so wi2lingly after this sort? for a2l things come of th2e, and of thine own have we given th2e. 
For we are strangers before th2e, and sojourners, as were a2l our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding. 
O LORD our God, a2l this store that we have prepared to build th2e an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is a2l thine own. 
I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightne2s. As for me, in the uprightne2s of mine heart I have wi2lingly o2fered a2l these things: and now have I s2en with joy thy people, which are present here, to o2fer wi2lingly unto th2e. 
O LORD God of Abraham, Is2ac, and of Israel, our fathers, k2ep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto th2e: 
And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to k2ep thy co2mandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do a2l these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision. 
And David said to a2l the congregation, Now ble2s the LORD your God. And a2l the congregation ble2sed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshi2ped the LORD, and the king. 
And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and o2fered burnt o2ferings unto the LORD, on the mo2row after that day, even a thousand bu2locks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink o2ferings, and sacrifices in abundance for a2l Israel: 
And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladne2s. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest. 
Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and a2l Israel obeyed him. 
And a2l the princes, and the mighty men, and a2l the sons likewise of king David, submi2ted themselves unto Solomon the king. 
And the LORD magnified Solomon exc2edingly in the sight of a2l Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not b2en on any king before him in Israel. 
Thus David the son of Je2se reigned over a2l Israel. 
And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and thr2e years reigned he in Jerusalem. 
And he died in a g2od old age, fu2l of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead. 
Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are wri2ten in the b2ok of Samuel the s2er, and in the b2ok of Nathan the prophet, and in the b2ok of Gad the s2er, 
With a2l his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over a2l the kingdoms of the countries. 
And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exc2edingly. 
Then Solomon spake unto a2l Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in a2l Israel, the chief of the fathers. 
So Solomon, and a2l the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderne2s. 
But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem. 
Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezal2el the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it. 
And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and o2fered a thousand burnt o2ferings upon it. 
In that night did God a2pear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I sha2l give th2e. 
And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead. 
Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude. 
Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great? 
And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made th2e king: 
Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto th2e; and I wi2l give th2e riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have b2en before th2e, neither sha2l there any after th2e have the like. 
Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel. 
And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. 
And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar tr2es made he as the sycomore tr2es that are in the vale for abundance. 
And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price. 
And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for a2l the kings of the Hi2tites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means. 
And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom. 
And Solomon told out thr2escore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and thr2e thousand and six hundred to overs2e them. 
And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwe2l therein, even so deal with me. 
Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sw2et incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt o2ferings morning and evening, on the sa2baths, and on the new m2ons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an ordinance for ever to Israel. 
And the house which I build is great: for great is our God above a2l gods. 
But who is able to build him an house, s2eing the heaven and heaven of heavens ca2not contain him? who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him? 
Send me now therefore a man cu2ning to work in gold, and in silver, and in bra2s, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can ski2l to grave with the cu2ning men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide. 
Send me also cedar tr2es, fir tr2es, and algum tr2es, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can ski2l to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants sha2l be with thy servants, 
Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build sha2l be wonderful great. 
And, behold, I wi2l give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil. 
Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made th2e king over them. 
Huram said moreover, Ble2sed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom. 
And now I have sent a cu2ning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's, 
The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in bra2s, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any ma2ner of graving, and to find out every device which sha2l be put to him, with thy cu2ning men, and with the cu2ning men of my lord David thy father. 
Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants: 
And we wi2l cut w2od out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt n2ed: and we wi2l bring it to th2e in floats by sea to Jo2pa; and thou shalt ca2ry it up to Jerusalem. 
And Solomon numbered a2l the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and thr2e thousand and six hundred. 
And he set thr2escore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and thr2e thousand and six hundred overs2ers to set the people a work. 
Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the Lord a2peared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfl2or of Ornan the Jebusite. 
And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign. 
Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was thr2escore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits. 
And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was a2cording to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold. 
And the greater house he cieled with fir tr2e, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm tr2es and chains. 
And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim. 
He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the wa2ls thereof, and the d2ors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the wa2ls. 
And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was a2cording to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents. 
And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the u2per chambers with gold. 
And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold. 
And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wa2l of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub. 
And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wa2l of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub. 
The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they st2od on their f2et, and their faces were inward. 
And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon. 
Also he made before the house two pi2lars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits. 
And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pi2lars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains. 
And he reared up the pi2lars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and ca2led the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz. 
Moreover he made an altar of bra2s, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof. 
Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compa2s, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compa2s it round about. 
And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compa2s it round about: ten in a cubit, compa2sing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast. 
It st2od upon twelve oxen, thr2e l2oking toward the north, and thr2e l2oking toward the west, and thr2e l2oking toward the south, and thr2e l2oking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and a2l their hinder parts were inward. 
And the thickne2s of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it received and held thr2e thousand baths. 
He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they o2fered for the burnt o2fering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in. 
And he made ten candlesticks of gold a2cording to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left. 
He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of gold. 
Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and d2ors for the court, and overlaid the d2ors of them with bra2s. 
And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south. 
And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God; 
To wit, the two pi2lars, and the po2mels, and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pi2lars, and the two wreaths to cover the two po2mels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pi2lars; 
And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two po2mels of the chapiters which were upon the pi2lars. 
He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases; 
One sea, and twelve oxen under it. 
The pots also, and the shovels, and the fles2h2oks, and a2l their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright bra2s. 
In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground betw2en Su2coth and Zeredathah. 
Thus Solomon made a2l these ve2sels in great abundance: for the weight of the bra2s could not be found out. 
And Solomon made a2l the ve2sels that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread was set; 
Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the ma2ner before the oracle, of pure gold; 
And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and that perfect gold; 
And the snu2fers, and the basons, and the sp2ons, and the censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the i2ner d2ors thereof for the most holy place, and the d2ors of the house of the temple, were of gold. 
Thus a2l the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in a2l the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and a2l the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God. 
Then Solomon a2sembled the elders of Israel, and a2l the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion. 
Wherefore a2l the men of Israel a2sembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month. 
And a2l the elders of Israel came; and the Levites t2ok up the ark. 
And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and a2l the holy ve2sels that were in the tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up. 
Also king Solomon, and a2l the congregation of Israel that were a2sembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sh2ep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude. 
And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims: 
For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above. 
And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the staves were s2en from the ark before the oracle; but they were not s2en without. And there it is unto this day. 
There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt. 
And it came to pa2s, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for a2l the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course: 
Also the Levites which were the singers, a2l of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being a2rayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, st2od at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:) 
It came even to pa2s, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is g2od; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was fi2led with a cloud, even the house of the LORD; 
So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had fi2led the house of God. 
Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwe2l in the thick darkne2s. 
But I have built an house of habitation for th2e, and a place for thy dwe2ling for ever. 
And the king turned his face, and ble2sed the whole congregation of Israel: and a2l the congregation of Israel st2od. 
And he said, Ble2sed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfi2led that which he spake with his mouth to my father David, saying, 
Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among a2l the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel: 
But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel. 
Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel. 
But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst we2l in that it was in thine heart: 
Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son which sha2l come forth out of thy loins, he sha2l build the house for my name. 
The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for I am risen up in the r2om of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel. 
And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel. 
And he st2od before the altar of the LORD in the presence of a2l the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands: 
For Solomon had made a brasen sca2fold of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and thr2e cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he st2od, and kn2eled down upon his kn2es before a2l the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven. 
And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like th2e in the heaven, nor in the earth; which k2epest covenant, and shewest mercy unto thy servants, that walk before th2e with a2l their hearts: 
Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfi2led it with thine hand, as it is this day. 
Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, k2ep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There sha2l not fail th2e a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take h2ed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me. 
Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David. 
But wi2l God in very d2ed dwe2l with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens ca2not contain th2e; how much le2s this house which I have built! 
Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his su2plication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before th2e: 
That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place. 
Hearken therefore unto the su2plications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they sha2l make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwe2ling place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive. 
If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house; 
Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him a2cording to his righteousne2s. 
And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have si2ned against th2e; and sha2l return and confe2s thy name, and pray and make su2plication before th2e in this house; 
Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers. 
When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have si2ned against th2e; yet if they pray toward this place, and confe2s thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost a2flict them; 
Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the g2od way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance. 
If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpi2lers; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickne2s there be: 
Then what prayer or what su2plication soever sha2l be made of any man, or of a2l thy people Israel, when every one sha2l know his own sore and his own grief, and sha2l spread forth his hands in this house: 
Then hear thou from heaven thy dwe2ling place, and forgive, and render unto every man a2cording unto a2l his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men:) 
That they may fear th2e, to walk in thy ways, so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers. 
Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name's sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they come and pray in this house; 
Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwe2ling place, and do a2cording to a2l that the stranger ca2leth to th2e for; that a2l people of the earth may know thy name, and fear th2e, as doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is ca2led by thy name. 
If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto th2e toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name; 
Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their su2plication, and maintain their cause. 
If they sin against th2e, (for there is no man which si2neth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they ca2ry them away captives unto a land far o2f or near; 
Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are ca2ried captive, and turn and pray unto th2e in the land of their captivity, saying, We have si2ned, we have done ami2s, and have dealt wickedly; 
If they return to th2e with a2l their heart and with a2l their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have ca2ried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name: 
Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwe2ling place, their prayer and their su2plications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people which have si2ned against th2e. 
Now, my God, let, I bes2ech th2e, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be a2tent unto the prayer that is made in this place. 
Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou, and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in g2odne2s. 
O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember the mercies of David thy servant. 
Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt o2fering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD fi2led the house. 
And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had fi2led the LORD's house. 
And when a2l the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshi2ped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is g2od; for his mercy endureth for ever. 
Then the king and a2l the people o2fered sacrifices before the LORD. 
And king Solomon o2fered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sh2ep: so the king and a2l the people dedicated the house of God. 
And the priests waited on their o2fices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and a2l Israel st2od. 
Moreover Solomon ha2lowed the mi2dle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he o2fered burnt o2ferings, and the fat of the peace o2ferings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt o2ferings, and the meat o2ferings, and the fat. 
Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and a2l Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt. 
And in the eighth day they made a solemn a2sembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days. 
And on the thr2e and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and me2ry in heart for the g2odne2s that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people. 
Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's house: and a2l that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously e2fected. 
And the LORD a2peared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice. 
If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I co2mand the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people; 
If my people, which are ca2led by my name, sha2l humble themselves, and pray, and s2ek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then wi2l I hear from heaven, and wi2l forgive their sin, and wi2l heal their land. 
Now mine eyes sha2l be open, and mine ears a2tent unto the prayer that is made in this place. 
For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart sha2l be there perpetua2ly. 
And as for th2e, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do a2cording to a2l that I have co2manded th2e, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments; 
Then wi2l I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, a2cording as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There sha2l not fail th2e a man to be ruler in Israel. 
But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my co2mandments, which I have set before you, and sha2l go and serve other gods, and worship them; 
Then wi2l I pluck them up by the r2ots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, wi2l I cast out of my sight, and wi2l make it to be a proverb and a byword among a2l nations. 
And this house, which is high, sha2l be an astonishment to every one that pa2seth by it; so that he sha2l say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house? 
And it sha2l be answered, Because they fors2ok the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshi2ped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought a2l this evil upon them. 
And it came to pa2s at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house, 
That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwe2l there. 
And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it. 
And he built Tadmor in the wilderne2s, and a2l the store cities, which he built in Hamath. 
Also he built Bet2horon the u2per, and Bet2horon the nether, fenced cities, with wa2ls, gates, and bars; 
And B2alath, and a2l the store cities that Solomon had, and a2l the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and a2l that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout a2l the land of his dominion. 
As for a2l the people that were left of the Hi2tites, and the Amorites, and the Peri2zites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which were not of Israel, 
But of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day. 
But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen. 
And these were the chief of king Solomon's o2ficers, even two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people. 
And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife sha2l not dwe2l in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come. 
Then Solomon o2fered burnt o2ferings unto the LORD on the altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch, 
Even after a certain rate every day, o2fering a2cording to the co2mandment of Moses, on the sa2baths, and on the new m2ons, and on the solemn feasts, thr2e times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of w2eks, and in the feast of tabernacles. 
And he a2pointed, a2cording to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God co2manded. 
And they departed not from the co2mandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any ma2ter, or concerning the treasures. 
Now a2l the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was perfected. 
Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom. 
And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and t2ok thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon. 
And when the qu2en of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she co2muned with him of a2l that was in her heart. 
And Solomon told her a2l her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not. 
And when the qu2en of Sheba had s2en the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built, 
And the meat of his table, and the si2ting of his servants, and the a2tendance of his ministers, and their a2parel; his cupbearers also, and their a2parel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her. 
And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom: 
Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had s2en it: and, behold, the one half of the greatne2s of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou exc2edest the fame that I heard. 
Ha2py are thy men, and ha2py are these thy servants, which stand continua2ly before th2e, and hear thy wisdom. 
Ble2sed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in th2e to set th2e on his throne, to be king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he th2e king over them, to do judgment and justice. 
And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the qu2en of Sheba gave king Solomon. 
And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum tr2es and precious stones. 
And the king made of the algum tr2es te2races to the house of the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such s2en before in the land of Judah. 
And king Solomon gave to the qu2en of Sheba a2l her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants. 
Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and thr2escore and six talents of gold; 
Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And a2l the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. 
And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target. 
And thr2e hundred shields made he of beaten gold: thr2e hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. 
Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. 
And there were six steps to the throne, with a f2otst2ol of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the si2ting place, and two lions standing by the stays: 
And twelve lions st2od there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom. 
And a2l the drinking ve2sels of king Solomon were of gold, and a2l the ve2sels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was not any thing a2counted of in the days of Solomon. 
For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every thr2e years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. 
And king Solomon pa2sed a2l the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. 
And a2l the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart. 
And they brought every man his present, ve2sels of silver, and ve2sels of gold, and raiment, harne2s, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. 
And Solomon had four thousand sta2ls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. 
And he reigned over a2l the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. 
And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar tr2es made he as the sycomore tr2es that are in the low plains in abundance. 
And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of a2l lands. 
Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not wri2ten in the b2ok of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of I2do the s2er against Jeroboam the son of Nebat? 
And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over a2l Israel forty years. 
And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead. 
And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were a2l Israel come to make him king. 
And it came to pa2s, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was in Egypt, whither he fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt. 
And they sent and ca2led him. So Jeroboam and a2l Israel came and spake to Rehoboam, saying, 
Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we wi2l serve th2e. 
And he said unto them, Come again unto me after thr2e days. And the people departed. 
And king Rehoboam t2ok counsel with the old men that had st2od before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye me to return answer to this people? 
And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak g2od words to them, they wi2l be thy servants for ever. 
But he fors2ok the counsel which the old men gave him, and t2ok counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that st2od before him. 
And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us? 
And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto th2e, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My li2tle finger sha2l be thicker than my father's loins. 
For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I wi2l put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I wi2l chastise you with scorpions. 
So Jeroboam and a2l the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day. 
And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam fors2ok the counsel of the old men, 
And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I wi2l a2d thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I wi2l chastise you with scorpions. 
So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 
And when a2l Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? and we have none inheritance in the son of Je2se: every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, s2e to thine own house. So a2l Israel went to their tents. 
But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. 
Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king Rehoboam made sp2ed to get him up to his chariot, to fl2e to Jerusalem. 
And Israel rebe2led against the house of David unto this day. 
And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were wa2riors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam. 
But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, 
Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to a2l Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying, 
Thus saith the LORD, Ye sha2l not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam. 
And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah. 
He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa, 
And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adu2lam, 
And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph, 
And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah, 
And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities. 
And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine. 
And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made them exc2eding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side. 
And the priests and the Levites that were in a2l Israel resorted to him out of a2l their coasts. 
For the Levites left their suburbs and their po2se2sion, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them o2f from executing the priest's o2fice unto the LORD: 
And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made. 
And after them out of a2l the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to s2ek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers. 
So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, thr2e years: for thr2e years they walked in the way of David and Solomon. 
And Rehoboam t2ok him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Je2se; 
Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham. 
And after her he t2ok M2achah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and A2tai, and Ziza, and Shelomith. 
And Rehoboam loved M2achah the daughter of Absalom above a2l his wives and his concubines: (for he t2ok eight2en wives, and thr2escore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and thr2escore daughters.) 
And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of M2achah the chief, to be ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king. 
And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of a2l his children throughout a2l the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives. 
And it came to pa2s, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he fors2ok the law of the LORD, and a2l Israel with him. 
And it came to pa2s, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgre2sed against the LORD, 
With twelve hundred chariots, and thr2escore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Su2k2ims, and the Ethiopians. 
And he t2ok the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem. 
Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak. 
Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous. 
And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I wi2l not destroy them, but I wi2l grant them some deliverance; and my wrath sha2l not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak. 
Neverthele2s they sha2l be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries. 
So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and t2ok away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he t2ok a2l: he ca2ried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made. 
Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of bra2s, and co2mi2ted them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house. 
And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber. 
And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went we2l. 
So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sevent2en years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of a2l the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was N2amah an A2monite2s. 
And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to s2ek the LORD. 
Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not wri2ten in the b2ok of Shemaiah the prophet, and of I2do the s2er concerning genealogies? And there were wars betw2en Rehoboam and Jeroboam continua2ly. 
And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead. 
Now in the eight2enth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah. 
He reigned thr2e years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war betw2en Abijah and Jeroboam. 
And Abijah set the ba2tle in a2ray with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the ba2tle in a2ray against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour. 
And Abijah st2od up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and a2l Israel; 
Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt? 
Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebe2led against his lord. 
And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them. 
And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and there are with your golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods. 
Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the ma2ner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bu2lock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods. 
But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their busine2s: 
And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sw2et incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we k2ep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him. 
And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye sha2l not prosper. 
But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them. 
And when Judah l2oked back, behold, the ba2tle was before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. 
Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pa2s, that God smote Jeroboam and a2l Israel before Abijah and Judah. 
And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand. 
And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fe2l down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men. 
Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers. 
And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and t2ok cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephraim with the towns thereof. 
Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died. 
But Abijah waxed mighty, and ma2ried fourt2en wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixt2en daughters. 
And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are wri2ten in the story of the prophet I2do. 
So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years. 
And Asa did that which was g2od and right in the eyes of the LORD his God: 
For he t2ok away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves: 
And co2manded Judah to s2ek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the co2mandment. 
Also he t2ok away out of a2l the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him. 
And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest. 
Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them wa2ls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered. 
And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah thr2e hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: a2l these were mighty men of valour. 
And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and thr2e hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah. 
Then Asa went out against him, and they set the ba2tle in a2ray in the va2ley of Zephathah at Mareshah. 
And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with th2e to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on th2e, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let no man prevail against th2e. 
So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. 
And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they ca2ried away very much spoil. 
And they smote a2l the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled a2l the cities; for there was exc2eding much spoil in them. 
They smote also the tents of ca2tle, and ca2ried away sh2ep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem. 
And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded: 
And he went out to m2et Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and a2l Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye s2ek him, he wi2l be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he wi2l forsake you. 
Now for a long season Israel hath b2en without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law. 
But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them. 
And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon a2l the inhabitants of the countries. 
And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with a2l adversity. 
Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work sha2l be rewarded. 
And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he t2ok courage, and put away the abominable idols out of a2l the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD. 
And he gathered a2l Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Mana2seh, and out of Simeon: for they fe2l to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him. 
So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fift2enth year of the reign of Asa. 
And they o2fered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sh2ep. 
And they entered into a covenant to s2ek the LORD God of their fathers with a2l their heart and with a2l their soul; 
That whosoever would not s2ek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether sma2l or great, whether man or woman. 
And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets. 
And a2l Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with a2l their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about. 
And also concerning M2achah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being qu2en, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the br2ok Kidron. 
But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: neverthele2s the heart of Asa was perfect a2l his days. 
And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and ve2sels. 
And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa. 
In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa B2asha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 
Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, 
There is a league betw2en me and th2e, as there was betw2en my father and thy father: behold, I have sent th2e silver and gold; go, break thy league with B2asha king of Israel, that he may depart from me. 
And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and a2l the store cities of Naphtali. 
And it came to pa2s, when B2asha heard it, that he left o2f building of Ramah, and let his work cease. 
Then Asa the king t2ok a2l Judah; and they ca2ried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith B2asha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah. 
And at that time Hanani the s2er came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand. 
Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand. 
For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done f2olishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars. 
Then Asa was wroth with the s2er, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa o2pre2sed some of the people the same time. 
And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are wri2ten in the b2ok of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his f2et, until his disease was exc2eding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians. 
And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign. 
And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was fi2led with sw2et odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great burning for him. 
And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel. 
And he placed forces in a2l the fenced cities of Judah, and set ga2risons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken. 
And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto B2alim; 
But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his co2mandments, and not after the doings of Israel. 
Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and a2l Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in abundance. 
And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he t2ok away the high places and groves out of Judah. 
Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethan2el, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah. 
And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests. 
And they taught in Judah, and had the b2ok of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout a2l the cities of Judah, and taught the people. 
And the fear of the LORD fe2l upon a2l the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat. 
Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats. 
And Jehoshaphat waxed great exc2edingly; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store. 
And he had much busine2s in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem. 
And these are the numbers of them a2cording to the house of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valour thr2e hundred thousand. 
And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand. 
And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who wi2lingly o2fered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour. 
And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand. 
And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war. 
These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout a2l Judah. 
Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined a2finity with Ahab. 
And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab ki2led sh2ep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead. 
And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we wi2l be with th2e in the war. 
And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray th2e, at the word of the LORD to day. 
Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Sha2l we go to Ramothgilead to ba2tle, or sha2l I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God wi2l deliver it into the king's hand. 
But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him? 
And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied g2od unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so. 
And the king of Israel ca2led for one of his o2ficers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla. 
And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and a2l the prophets prophesied before them. 
And Zedekiah the son of Chen2anah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed. 
And a2l the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD sha2l deliver it into the hand of the king. 
And the me2senger that went to ca2l Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare g2od to the king with one a2sent; let thy word therefore, I pray th2e, be like one of their's, and speak thou g2od. 
And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that wi2l I speak. 
And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, sha2l we go to Ramothgilead to ba2tle, or sha2l I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they sha2l be delivered into your hand. 
And the king said to him, How many times sha2l I adjure th2e that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD? 
Then he said, I did s2e a2l Israel sca2tered upon the mountains, as sh2ep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace. 
And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not te2l th2e that he would not prophesy g2od unto me, but evil? 
Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD si2ting upon his throne, and a2l the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left. 
And the LORD said, Who sha2l entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fa2l at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this ma2ner, and another saying after that ma2ner. 
Then there came out a spirit, and st2od before the LORD, and said, I wi2l entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? 
And he said, I wi2l go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of a2l his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so. 
Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against th2e. 
Then Zedekiah the son of Chen2anah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the ch2ek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto th2e? 
And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt s2e on that day when thou shalt go into an i2ner chamber to hide thyself. 
Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and ca2ry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; 
And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fe2low in the prison, and f2ed him with bread of a2fliction and with water of a2fliction, until I return in peace. 
And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, a2l ye people. 
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead. 
And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I wi2l disguise myself, and I wi2l go to the ba2tle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the ba2tle. 
Now the king of Syria had co2manded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with sma2l or great, save only with the king of Israel. 
And it came to pa2s, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they compa2sed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him. 
For it came to pa2s, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him. 
And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel betw2en the joints of the harne2s: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest ca2ry me out of the host; for I am wounded. 
And the ba2tle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died. 
And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem. 
And Jehu the son of Hanani the s2er went out to m2et him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon th2e from before the LORD. 
Neverthele2s there are g2od things found in th2e, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to s2ek God. 
And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from B2ersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers. 
And he set judges in the land throughout a2l the fenced cities of Judah, city by city, 
And said to the judges, Take h2ed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment. 
Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take h2ed and do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts. 
Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem. 
And he charged them, saying, Thus sha2l ye do in the fear of the LORD, faithfu2ly, and with a perfect heart. 
And what cause soever sha2l come to you of your brethren that dwe2l in your cities, betw2en bl2od and bl2od, betw2en law and co2mandment, statutes and judgments, ye sha2l even warn them that they trespa2s not against the LORD, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye sha2l not trespa2s. 
And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in a2l ma2ters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for a2l the king's ma2ters: also the Levites sha2l be o2ficers before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD sha2l be with the g2od. 
It came to pa2s after this also, that the children of Moab, and the children of A2mon, and with them other beside the A2monites, came against Jehoshaphat to ba2tle. 
Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against th2e from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they be in Hazazontamar, which is Engedi. 
And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to s2ek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout a2l Judah. 
And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the LORD: even out of a2l the cities of Judah they came to s2ek the LORD. 
And Jehoshaphat st2od in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court, 
And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and rulest not thou over a2l the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand th2e? 
Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the s2ed of Abraham thy friend for ever? 
And they dwelt therein, and have built th2e a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying, 
If, when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto th2e in our a2fliction, then thou wilt hear and help. 
And now, behold, the children of A2mon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not; 
Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy po2se2sion, which thou hast given us to inherit. 
O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon th2e. 
And a2l Judah st2od before the LORD, with their li2tle ones, their wives, and their children. 
Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Ma2taniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation; 
And he said, Hearken ye, a2l Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the ba2tle is not yours, but God's. 
To mo2row go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cli2f of Ziz; and ye sha2l find them at the end of the br2ok, before the wilderne2s of Jeruel. 
Ye sha2l not n2ed to fight in this ba2tle: set yourselves, stand ye sti2l, and s2e the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to mo2row go out against them: for the LORD wi2l be with you. 
And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and a2l Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fe2l before the LORD, worshi2ping the LORD. 
And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, st2od up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high. 
And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderne2s of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat st2od and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so sha2l ye be established; believe his prophets, so sha2l ye prosper. 
And when he had consulted with the people, he a2pointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holine2s, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever. 
And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of A2mon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smi2ten. 
For the children of A2mon and Moab st2od up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, u2terly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another. 
And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderne2s, they l2oked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fa2len to the earth, and none escaped. 
And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stri2ped o2f for themselves, more than they could ca2ry away: and they were thr2e days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much. 
And on the fourth day they a2sembled themselves in the va2ley of Berachah; for there they ble2sed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place was ca2led, The va2ley of Berachah, unto this day. 
Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies. 
And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD. 
And the fear of God was on a2l the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel. 
So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about. 
And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD. 
Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers. 
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are wri2ten in the b2ok of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is mentioned in the b2ok of the kings of Israel. 
And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly: 
And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongaber. 
Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish. 
Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead. 
And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: a2l these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. 
And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn. 
Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew a2l his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel. 
Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 
And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD. 
Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever. 
In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king. 
Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and a2l his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compa2sed him in, and the captains of the chariots. 
So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers. 
Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to co2mit fornication, and compe2led Judah thereto. 
And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah, 
But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were be2ter than thyself: 
Behold, with a great plague wi2l the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and a2l thy g2ods: 
And thou shalt have great sickne2s by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fa2l out by reason of the sickne2s day by day. 
Moreover the LORD sti2red up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians: 
And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and ca2ried away a2l the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons. 
And after a2l this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease. 
And it came to pa2s, that in proce2s of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fe2l out by reason of his sickne2s: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers. 
Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings. 
And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain a2l the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned. 
Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri. 
He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counse2lor to do wickedly. 
Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counse2lors after the death of his father to his destruction. 
He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram. 
And he returned to be healed in Jezr2el because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to s2e Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezr2el, because he was sick. 
And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut o2f the house of Ahab. 
And it came to pa2s, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them. 
And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with a2l his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to k2ep sti2l the kingdom. 
But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed a2l the s2ed royal of the house of Judah. 
But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, t2ok Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not. 
And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land. 
And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and t2ok the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and M2aseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him. 
And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of a2l the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem. 
And a2l the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son sha2l reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David. 
This is the thing that ye sha2l do; A third part of you entering on the sa2bath, of the priests and of the Levites, sha2l be porters of the d2ors; 
And a third part sha2l be at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and a2l the people sha2l be in the courts of the house of the LORD. 
But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they sha2l go in, for they are holy: but a2l the people sha2l k2ep the watch of the LORD. 
And the Levites sha2l compa2s the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the house, he sha2l be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out. 
So the Levites and a2l Judah did a2cording to a2l things that Jehoiada the priest had co2manded, and t2ok every man his men that were to come in on the sa2bath, with them that were to go out on the sa2bath: for Jehoiada the priest dismi2sed not the courses. 
Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had b2en king David's, which were in the house of God. 
And he set a2l the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about. 
Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king. 
Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people ru2ning and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD: 
And she l2oked, and, behold, the king st2od at his pi2lar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and a2l the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason. 
Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso fo2loweth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD. 
So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there. 
And Jehoiada made a covenant betw2en him, and betw2en a2l the people, and betw2en the king, that they should be the LORD's people. 
Then a2l the people went to the house of B2al, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Ma2tan the priest of B2al before the altars. 
Also Jehoiada a2pointed the o2fices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to o2fer the burnt o2ferings of the LORD, as it is wri2ten in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David. 
And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in. 
And he t2ok the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and a2l the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom. 
And a2l the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword. 
Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Zibiah of B2ersheba. 
And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD a2l the days of Jehoiada the priest. 
And Jehoiada t2ok for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters. 
And it came to pa2s after this, that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD. 
And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of a2l Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and s2e that ye hasten the ma2ter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not. 
And the king ca2led for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the co2lection, a2cording to the co2mandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witne2s? 
For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also a2l the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon B2alim. 
And at the king's co2mandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD. 
And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the co2lection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderne2s. 
And a2l the princes and a2l the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end. 
Now it came to pa2s, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's o2fice by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's o2ficer came and emptied the chest, and t2ok it, and ca2ried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance. 
And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and bra2s to mend the house of the LORD. 
So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it. 
And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made ve2sels for the house of the LORD, even ve2sels to minister, and to o2fer withal, and sp2ons, and ve2sels of gold and silver. And they o2fered burnt o2ferings in the house of the LORD continua2ly a2l the days of Jehoiada. 
But Jehoiada waxed old, and was fu2l of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died. 
And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done g2od in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house. 
Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them. 
And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespa2s. 
Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear. 
And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which st2od above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgre2s ye the co2mandments of the LORD, that ye ca2not prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you. 
And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the co2mandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD. 
Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindne2s which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD l2ok upon it, and require it. 
And it came to pa2s at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed a2l the princes of the people from among the people, and sent a2l the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus. 
For the army of the Syrians came with a sma2l company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash. 
And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the bl2od of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings. 
And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an A2monite2s, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabite2s. 
Now concerning his sons, and the greatne2s of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are wri2ten in the story of the b2ok of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead. 
Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoa2dan of Jerusalem. 
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart. 
Now it came to pa2s, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had ki2led the king his father. 
But he slew not their children, but did as it is wri2ten in the law in the b2ok of Moses, where the LORD co2manded, saying, The fathers sha2l not die for the children, neither sha2l the children die for the fathers, but every man sha2l die for his own sin. 
Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, a2cording to the houses of their fathers, throughout a2l Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them thr2e hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield. 
He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver. 
But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with th2e; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit, with a2l the children of Ephraim. 
But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the ba2tle: God sha2l make th2e fa2l before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down. 
And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what sha2l we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give th2e much more than this. 
Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger. 
And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the va2ley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand. 
And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah ca2ry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they a2l were broken in pieces. 
But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to ba2tle, fe2l upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bet2horon, and smote thr2e thousand of them, and t2ok much spoil. 
Now it came to pa2s, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them. 
Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand? 
And it came to pa2s, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smi2ten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy th2e, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel. 
Then Amaziah king of Judah t2ok advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us s2e one another in the face. 
And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there pa2sed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle. 
Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smi2ten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth th2e up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou me2dle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fa2l, even thou, and Judah with th2e? 
But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom. 
So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah. 
And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent. 
And Joash the king of Israel t2ok Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wa2l of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits. 
And he t2ok a2l the gold and the silver, and a2l the ve2sels that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria. 
And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fift2en years. 
Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not wri2ten in the b2ok of the kings of Judah and Israel? 
Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from fo2lowing the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there. 
And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah. 
Then a2l the people of Judah t2ok U2ziah, who was sixt2en years old, and made him king in the r2om of his father Amaziah. 
He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers. 
Sixt2en years old was U2ziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. 
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, a2cording to a2l that his father Amaziah did. 
And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper. 
And he went forth and wa2red against the Philistines, and brake down the wa2l of Gath, and the wa2l of Jabneh, and the wa2l of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines. 
And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gurb2al, and the Mehunims. 
And the A2monites gave gifts to U2ziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exc2edingly. 
Moreover U2ziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the va2ley gate, and at the turning of the wa2l, and fortified them. 
Also he built towers in the desert, and di2ged many we2ls: for he had much ca2tle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and vine dre2sers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry. 
Moreover U2ziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, a2cording to the number of their a2count by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and M2aseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains. 
The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred. 
And under their hand was an army, thr2e hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy. 
And U2ziah prepared for them throughout a2l the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones. 
And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cu2ning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to sh2ot a2rows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marve2lously helped, ti2l he was strong. 
But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgre2sed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense. 
And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men: 
And they withst2od U2ziah the king, and said unto him, It a2pertaineth not unto th2e, U2ziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespa2sed; neither sha2l it be for thine honour from the LORD God. 
Then U2ziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar. 
And Azariah the chief priest, and a2l the priests, l2oked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smi2ten him. 
And U2ziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut o2f from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land. 
Now the rest of the acts of U2ziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write. 
So U2ziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead. 
Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixt2en years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok. 
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, a2cording to a2l that his father U2ziah did: howbeit he entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did yet co2ruptly. 
He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wa2l of Ophel he built much. 
Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers. 
He fought also with the king of the A2monites, and prevailed against them. And the children of A2mon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of A2mon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third. 
So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God. 
Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and a2l his wars, and his ways, lo, they are wri2ten in the b2ok of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixt2en years in Jerusalem. 
And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead. 
Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixt2en years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father: 
For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for B2alim. 
Moreover he burnt incense in the va2ley of the son of Hi2nom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel. 
He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hi2ls, and under every gr2en tr2e. 
Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and ca2ried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter. 
For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were a2l valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. 
And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew M2aseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king. 
And the children of Israel ca2ried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and t2ok also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria. 
But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven. 
And now ye purpose to k2ep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God? 
Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you. 
Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshi2lemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Sha2lum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, st2od up against them that came from the war, 
And said unto them, Ye sha2l not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have o2fended against the LORD already, ye intend to a2d more to our sins and to our trespa2s: for our trespa2s is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel. 
So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and a2l the congregation. 
And the men which were expre2sed by name rose up, and t2ok the captives, and with the spoil clothed a2l that were naked among them, and a2rayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and ca2ried a2l the f2eble of them upon a2ses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm tr2es, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria. 
At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of A2syria to help him. 
For again the Edomites had come and smi2ten Judah, and ca2ried away captives. 
The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the vi2lages thereof, and Timnah with the vi2lages thereof, Gimzo also and the vi2lages thereof: and they dwelt there. 
For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgre2sed sore against the LORD. 
And Tilgathpilneser king of A2syria came unto him, and distre2sed him, but strengthened him not. 
For Ahaz t2ok away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of A2syria: but he helped him not. 
And in the time of his distre2s did he trespa2s yet more against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz. 
For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore wi2l I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of a2l Israel. 
And Ahaz gathered together the ve2sels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the ve2sels of the house of God, and shut up the d2ors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem. 
And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers. 
Now the rest of his acts and of a2l his ways, first and last, behold, they are wri2ten in the b2ok of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead. 
Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. 
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, a2cording to a2l that David his father had done. 
He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the d2ors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them. 
And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east str2et, 
And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and ca2ry forth the filthine2s out of the holy place. 
For our fathers have trespa2sed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs. 
Also they have shut up the d2ors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor o2fered burnt o2ferings in the holy place unto the God of Israel. 
Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hi2sing, as ye s2e with your eyes. 
For, lo, our fathers have fa2len by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this. 
Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us. 
My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn incense. 
Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zi2mah, and Eden the son of Joah: 
And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Ma2taniah: 
And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and U2ziel. 
And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, a2cording to the co2mandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD. 
And the priests went into the i2ner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out a2l the unclea2ne2s that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites t2ok it, to ca2ry it out abroad into the br2ok Kidron. 
Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixt2enth day of the first month they made an end. 
Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed a2l the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt o2fering, with a2l the ve2sels thereof, and the shewbread table, with a2l the ve2sels thereof. 
Moreover a2l the ve2sels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgre2sion, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the LORD. 
Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD. 
And they brought seven bu2locks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin o2fering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he co2manded the priests the sons of Aaron to o2fer them on the altar of the LORD. 
So they ki2led the bu2locks, and the priests received the bl2od, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had ki2led the rams, they sprinkled the bl2od upon the altar: they ki2led also the lambs, and they sprinkled the bl2od upon the altar. 
And they brought forth the he goats for the sin o2fering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them: 
And the priests ki2led them, and they made reconciliation with their bl2od upon the altar, to make an atonement for a2l Israel: for the king co2manded that the burnt o2fering and the sin o2fering should be made for a2l Israel. 
And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, a2cording to the co2mandment of David, and of Gad the king's s2er, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the co2mandment of the LORD by his prophets. 
And the Levites st2od with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets. 
And Hezekiah co2manded to o2fer the burnt o2fering upon the altar. And when the burnt o2fering began, the song of the LORD began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel. 
And a2l the congregation worshi2ped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: and a2l this continued until the burnt o2fering was finished. 
And when they had made an end of o2fering, the king and a2l that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshi2ped. 
Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes co2manded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the s2er. And they sang praises with gladne2s, and they bowed their heads and worshi2ped. 
Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank o2ferings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank o2ferings; and as many as were of a fr2e heart burnt o2ferings. 
And the number of the burnt o2ferings, which the congregation brought, was thr2escore and ten bu2locks, an hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: a2l these were for a burnt o2fering to the LORD. 
And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and thr2e thousand sh2ep. 
But the priests were t2o few, so that they could not flay a2l the burnt o2ferings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, ti2l the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests. 
And also the burnt o2ferings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace o2ferings, and the drink o2ferings for every burnt o2fering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order. 
And Hezekiah rejoiced, and a2l the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was done su2denly. 
And Hezekiah sent to a2l Israel and Judah, and wrote le2ters also to Ephraim and Mana2seh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to k2ep the pa2sover unto the LORD God of Israel. 
For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and a2l the congregation in Jerusalem, to k2ep the pa2sover in the second month. 
For they could not k2ep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves su2ficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem. 
And the thing pleased the king and a2l the congregation. 
So they established a decr2e to make proclamation throughout a2l Israel, from B2ersheba even to Dan, that they should come to k2ep the pa2sover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was wri2ten. 
So the posts went with the le2ters from the king and his princes throughout a2l Israel and Judah, and a2cording to the co2mandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Is2ac, and Israel, and he wi2l return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of A2syria. 
And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespa2sed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye s2e. 
Now be ye not sti2fnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fiercene2s of his wrath may turn away from you. 
For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children sha2l find compa2sion before them that lead them captive, so that they sha2l come again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and wi2l not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him. 
So the posts pa2sed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Mana2seh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them. 
Neverthele2s divers of Asher and Mana2seh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem. 
Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the co2mandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD. 
And there a2sembled at Jerusalem much people to k2ep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation. 
And they arose and t2ok away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and a2l the altars for incense t2ok they away, and cast them into the br2ok Kidron. 
Then they ki2led the pa2sover on the fourt2enth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt o2ferings into the house of the LORD. 
And they st2od in their place after their ma2ner, a2cording to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the bl2od, which they received of the hand of the Levites. 
For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the ki2ling of the pa2sovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the LORD. 
For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Mana2seh, I2sachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the pa2sover otherwise than it was wri2ten. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The g2od LORD pardon every one 
That prepareth his heart to s2ek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed a2cording to the purification of the sanctuary. 
And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people. 
And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladne2s: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD. 
And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto a2l the Levites that taught the g2od knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, o2fering peace o2ferings, and making confe2sion to the LORD God of their fathers. 
And the whole a2sembly t2ok counsel to k2ep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladne2s. 
For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bu2locks and seven thousand sh2ep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bu2locks and ten thousand sh2ep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves. 
And a2l the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and a2l the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced. 
So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem. 
Then the priests the Levites arose and ble2sed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwe2ling place, even unto heaven. 
Now when a2l this was finished, a2l Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of a2l Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Mana2seh, until they had u2terly destroyed them a2l. Then a2l the children of Israel returned, every man to his po2se2sion, into their own cities. 
And Hezekiah a2pointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man a2cording to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt o2ferings and for peace o2ferings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD. 
He a2pointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt o2ferings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt o2ferings, and the burnt o2ferings for the sa2baths, and for the new m2ons, and for the set feasts, as it is wri2ten in the law of the LORD. 
Moreover he co2manded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD. 
And as s2on as the co2mandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of a2l the increase of the field; and the tithe of a2l things brought they in abundantly. 
And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sh2ep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps. 
In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month. 
And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they ble2sed the LORD, and his people Israel. 
Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps. 
And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the o2ferings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath ble2sed his people; and that which is left is this great store. 
Then Hezekiah co2manded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them, 
And brought in the o2ferings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfu2ly: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was the next. 
And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overs2ers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the co2mandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God. 
And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, was over the fr2ewi2l o2ferings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things. 
And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their set o2fice, to give to their brethren by courses, as we2l to the great as to the sma2l: 
Beside their genealogy of males, from thr2e years old and upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges a2cording to their courses; 
Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses; 
And to the genealogy of a2l their li2tle ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through a2l the congregation: for in their set o2fice they sanctified themselves in holine2s: 
Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were expre2sed by name, to give portions to a2l the males among the priests, and to a2l that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites. 
And thus did Hezekiah throughout a2l Judah, and wrought that which was g2od and right and truth before the LORD his God. 
And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the co2mandments, to s2ek his God, he did it with a2l his heart, and prospered. 
After these things, and the establishment thereof, Se2nacherib king of A2syria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself. 
And when Hezekiah saw that Se2nacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem, 
He t2ok counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him. 
So there was gathered much people together, who sto2ped a2l the fountains, and the br2ok that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of A2syria come, and find much water? 
Also he strengthened himself, and built up a2l the wa2l that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wa2l without, and repaired Mi2lo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance. 
And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the str2et of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying, 
Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of A2syria, nor for a2l the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him: 
With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our ba2tles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah. 
After this did Se2nacherib king of A2syria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and a2l his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto a2l Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying, 
Thus saith Se2nacherib king of A2syria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem? 
Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God sha2l deliver us out of the hand of the king of A2syria? 
Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and co2manded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye sha2l worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it? 
Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto a2l the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand? 
Who was there among a2l the gods of those nations that my fathers u2terly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand? 
Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this ma2ner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much le2s sha2l your God deliver you out of mine hand? 
And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah. 
He wrote also le2ters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so sha2l not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand. 
Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' sp2ech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wa2l, to a2fright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city. 
And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man. 
And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven. 
And the LORD sent an angel, which cut o2f a2l the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of A2syria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword. 
Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Se2nacherib the king of A2syria, and from the hand of a2l other, and guided them on every side. 
And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of a2l nations from thenceforth. 
In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign. 
But Hezekiah rendered not again a2cording to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem. 
Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah. 
And Hezekiah had exc2eding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for a2l ma2ner of pleasant jewels; 
Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and sta2ls for a2l ma2ner of beasts, and cotes for flocks. 
Moreover he provided him cities, and po2se2sions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much. 
This same Hezekiah also sto2ped the u2per watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in a2l his works. 
Howbeit in the busine2s of the amba2sadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know a2l that was in his heart. 
Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his g2odne2s, behold, they are wri2ten in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the b2ok of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and a2l Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Mana2seh his son reigned in his stead. 
Mana2seh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem: 
But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel. 
For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for B2alim, and made groves, and worshi2ped a2l the host of heaven, and served them. 
Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, In Jerusalem sha2l my name be for ever. 
And he built altars for a2l the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD. 
And he caused his children to pa2s through the fire in the va2ley of the son of Hi2nom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. 
And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before a2l the tribes of Israel, wi2l I put my name for ever: 
Neither wi2l I any more remove the f2ot of Israel from out of the land which I have a2pointed for your fathers; so that they wi2l take h2ed to do a2l that I have co2manded them, a2cording to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses. 
So Mana2seh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to e2r, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel. 
And the LORD spake to Mana2seh, and to his people: but they would not hearken. 
Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of A2syria, which t2ok Mana2seh among the thorns, and bound him with fe2ters, and ca2ried him to Babylon. 
And when he was in a2fliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers, 
And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his su2plication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Mana2seh knew that the LORD he was God. 
Now after this he built a wa2l without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the va2ley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compa2sed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in a2l the fenced cities of Judah. 
And he t2ok away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and a2l the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city. 
And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace o2ferings and thank o2ferings, and co2manded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel. 
Neverthele2s the people did sacrifice sti2l in the high places, yet unto the LORD their God only. 
Now the rest of the acts of Mana2seh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the s2ers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are wri2ten in the b2ok of the kings of Israel. 
His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and a2l his sins, and his trespa2s, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are wri2ten among the sayings of the s2ers. 
So Mana2seh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead. 
Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem. 
But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Mana2seh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto a2l the carved images which Mana2seh his father had made, and served them; 
And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Mana2seh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespa2sed more and more. 
And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house. 
But the people of the land slew a2l them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead. 
Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years. 
And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand, nor to the left. 
For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to s2ek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images. 
And they brake down the altars of B2alim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them. 
And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem. 
And so did he in the cities of Mana2seh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their ma2tocks round about. 
And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down a2l the idols throughout a2l the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem. 
Now in the eight2enth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and M2aseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God. 
And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the d2ors had gathered of the hand of Mana2seh and Ephraim, and of a2l the remnant of Israel, and of a2l Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem. 
And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house: 
Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to fl2or the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed. 
And the men did the work faithfu2ly: and the overs2ers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshu2lam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and other of the Levites, a2l that could ski2l of instruments of musick. 
Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overs2ers of a2l that wrought the work in any ma2ner of service: and of the Levites there were scribes, and o2ficers, and porters. 
And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a b2ok of the law of the LORD given by Moses. 
And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the b2ok of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the b2ok to Shaphan. 
And Shaphan ca2ried the b2ok to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, A2l that was co2mi2ted to thy servants, they do it. 
And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overs2ers, and to the hand of the workmen. 
Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a b2ok. And Shaphan read it before the king. 
And it came to pa2s, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes. 
And the king co2manded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying, 
Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the b2ok that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after a2l that is wri2ten in this b2ok. 
And Hilkiah, and they that the king had a2pointed, went to Huldah the prophete2s, the wife of Sha2lum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, k2eper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the co2lege:) and they spake to her to that e2fect. 
And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Te2l ye the man that sent you to me, 
Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I wi2l bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even a2l the curses that are wri2ten in the b2ok which they have read before the king of Judah: 
Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with a2l the works of their hands; therefore my wrath sha2l be poured out upon this place, and sha2l not be quenched. 
And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so sha2l ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard; 
Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and w2ep before me; I have even heard th2e also, saith the LORD. 
Behold, I wi2l gather th2e to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither sha2l thine eyes s2e a2l the evil that I wi2l bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again. 
Then the king sent and gathered together a2l the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and a2l the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and a2l the people, great and sma2l: and he read in their ears a2l the words of the b2ok of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD. 
And the king st2od in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to k2ep his co2mandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with a2l his heart, and with a2l his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are wri2ten in this b2ok. 
And he caused a2l that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did a2cording to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers. 
And Josiah t2ok away a2l the abominations out of a2l the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made a2l that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And a2l his days they departed not from fo2lowing the LORD, the God of their fathers. 
Moreover Josiah kept a pa2sover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they ki2led the pa2sover on the fourt2enth day of the first month. 
And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD, 
And said unto the Levites that taught a2l Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it sha2l not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel, 
And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, a2cording to the writing of David king of Israel, and a2cording to the writing of Solomon his son. 
And stand in the holy place a2cording to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites. 
So ki2l the pa2sover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that they may do a2cording to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses. 
And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, a2l for the pa2sover o2ferings, for a2l that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and thr2e thousand bu2locks: these were of the king's substance. 
And his princes gave wi2lingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the pa2sover o2ferings two thousand and six hundred sma2l ca2tle and thr2e hundred oxen. 
Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethan2el, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for pa2sover o2ferings five thousand sma2l ca2tle, and five hundred oxen. 
So the service was prepared, and the priests st2od in their place, and the Levites in their courses, a2cording to the king's co2mandment. 
And they ki2led the pa2sover, and the priests sprinkled the bl2od from their hands, and the Levites flayed them. 
And they removed the burnt o2ferings, that they might give a2cording to the divisions of the families of the people, to o2fer unto the LORD, as it is wri2ten in the b2ok of Moses. And so did they with the oxen. 
And they roasted the pa2sover with fire a2cording to the ordinance: but the other holy o2ferings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them sp2edily among a2l the people. 
And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in o2fering of burnt o2ferings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron. 
And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, a2cording to the co2mandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's s2er; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them. 
So a2l the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to k2ep the pa2sover, and to o2fer burnt o2ferings upon the altar of the LORD, a2cording to the co2mandment of king Josiah. 
And the children of Israel that were present kept the pa2sover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days. 
And there was no pa2sover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did a2l the kings of Israel k2ep such a pa2sover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and a2l Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
In the eight2enth year of the reign of Josiah was this pa2sover kept. 
After a2l this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him. 
But he sent amba2sadors to him, saying, What have I to do with th2e, thou king of Judah? I come not against th2e this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God co2manded me to make haste: forbear th2e from me2dling with God, who is with me, that he destroy th2e not. 
Neverthele2s Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the va2ley of Megi2do. 
And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded. 
His servants therefore t2ok him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers. And a2l Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. 
And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and a2l the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are wri2ten in the lamentations. 
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his g2odne2s, a2cording to that which was wri2ten in the law of the LORD, 
And his d2eds, first and last, behold, they are wri2ten in the b2ok of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
Then the people of the land t2ok Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem. 
Jehoahaz was twenty and thr2e years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thr2e months in Jerusalem. 
And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. 
And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho t2ok Jehoahaz his brother, and ca2ried him to Egypt. 
Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God. 
Against him came up Nebuchadne2zar king of Babylon, and bound him in fe2ters, to ca2ry him to Babylon. 
Nebuchadne2zar also ca2ried of the ve2sels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon. 
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are wri2ten in the b2ok of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead. 
Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thr2e months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD. 
And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadne2zar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the g2odly ve2sels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem. 
Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. 
And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the LORD. 
And he also rebe2led against king Nebuchadne2zar, who had made him swear by God: but he sti2fened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel. 
Moreover a2l the chief of the priests, and the people, transgre2sed very much after a2l the abominations of the heathen; and po2luted the house of the LORD which he had ha2lowed in Jerusalem. 
And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his me2sengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compa2sion on his people, and on his dwe2ling place: 
But they mocked the me2sengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, ti2l there was no remedy. 
Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chald2es, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compa2sion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that st2oped for age: he gave them a2l into his hand. 
And a2l the ve2sels of the house of God, great and sma2l, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; a2l these he brought to Babylon. 
And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wa2l of Jerusalem, and burnt a2l the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed a2l the g2odly ve2sels thereof. 
And them that had escaped from the sword ca2ried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia: 
To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sa2baths: for as long as she lay desolate she kept sa2bath, to fulfil thr2escore and ten years. 
Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be a2complished, the LORD sti2red up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout a2l his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying, 
Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, A2l the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of a2l his people? The LORD his God be with him, and let him go up. 
Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfi2led, the LORD sti2red up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout a2l his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying, 
Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me a2l the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. 
Who is there among you of a2l his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem. 
And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with g2ods, and with beasts, beside the fr2ewi2l o2fering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem. 
Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with a2l them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem. 
And a2l they that were about them strengthened their hands with ve2sels of silver, with gold, with g2ods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside a2l that was wi2lingly o2fered. 
Also Cyrus the king brought forth the ve2sels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadne2zar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods; 
Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshba2zar, the prince of Judah. 
And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives, 
Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other ve2sels a thousand. 
A2l the ve2sels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. A2l these did Sheshba2zar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem. 
Now these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity, of those which had b2en ca2ried away, whom Nebuchadne2zar the king of Babylon had ca2ried away unto Babylon, and came again unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one unto his city; 
Which came with Zeru2babel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, R2elaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, B2anah. The number of the men of the people of Israel: 
The children of Parosh, two thousand an hundred seventy and two. 
The children of Shephatiah, thr2e hundred seventy and two. 
The children of Arah, seven hundred seventy and five. 
The children of Pahathmoab, of the children of Jeshua and Joab, two thousand eight hundred and twelve. 
The children of Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four. 
The children of Za2tu, nine hundred forty and five. 
The children of Za2cai, seven hundred and thr2escore. 
The children of Bani, six hundred forty and two. 
The children of Bebai, six hundred twenty and thr2e.

The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Peruda, 
The children of J2alah, the children of Darkon, the children of Gi2del, 
The children of Shephatiah, the children of Ha2til, the children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Ami. 
A2l the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, were thr2e hundred ninety and two. 
And these were they which went up from Telmelah, Telharsa, Cherub, A2dan, and I2mer: but they could not shew their father's house, and their s2ed, whether they were of Israel: 
The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two. 
And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzi2lai; which t2ok a wife of the daughters of Barzi2lai the Gileadite, and was ca2led after their name: 
These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as po2luted, put from the priesth2od. 
And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, ti2l there st2od up a priest with Urim and with Thu2mim. 
The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand thr2e hundred and thr2escore, 
Beside their servants and their maids, of whom there were seven thousand thr2e hundred thirty and seven: and there were among them two hundred singing men and singing women. 
Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five; 
Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their a2ses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty. 
And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, o2fered fr2ely for the house of God to set it up in his place: 
They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work thr2escore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pound of silver, and one hundred priests' garments. 
So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities, and a2l Israel in their cities. 
And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem. 
Then st2od up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zeru2babel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to o2fer burnt o2ferings thereon, as it is wri2ten in the law of Moses the man of God. 
And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they o2fered burnt o2ferings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt o2ferings morning and evening. 
They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is wri2ten, and o2fered the daily burnt o2ferings by number, a2cording to the custom, as the duty of every day required; 
And afterward o2fered the continual burnt o2fering, both of the new m2ons, and of a2l the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that wi2lingly o2fered a fr2ewi2l o2fering unto the LORD. 
From the first day of the seventh month began they to o2fer burnt o2ferings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid. 
They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar tr2es from Lebanon to the sea of Jo2pa, a2cording to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia. 
Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zeru2babel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and a2l they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and a2pointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD. 
Then st2od Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites. 
And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their a2parel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel. 
And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is g2od, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And a2l the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid. 
But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had s2en the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy: 
So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the w2eping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar o2f. 
Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel; 
Then they came to Zeru2babel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we s2ek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarha2don king of A2sur, which brought us up hither. 
But Zeru2babel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together wi2l build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath co2manded us. 
Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building, 
And hired counse2lors against them, to frustrate their purpose, a2l the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia. 
And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the begi2ning of his reign, wrote they unto him an a2cusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. 
And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tab2el, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the le2ter was wri2ten in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue. 
Rehum the chance2lor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a le2ter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort: 
Then wrote Rehum the chance2lor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites, 
And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asna2per brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a time. 
This is the copy of the le2ter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time. 
Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from th2e to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebe2lious and the bad city, and have set up the wa2ls thereof, and joined the foundations. 
Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the wa2ls set up again, then wi2l they not pay to2l, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings. 
Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not m2et for us to s2e the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king; 
That search may be made in the b2ok of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the b2ok of the records, and know that this city is a rebe2lious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed. 
We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the wa2ls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river. 
Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chance2lor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwe2l in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time. 
The le2ter which ye sent unto us hath b2en plainly read before me. 
And I co2manded, and search hath b2en made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insu2rection against kings, and that rebe2lion and sedition have b2en made therein. 
There have b2en mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over a2l countries beyond the river; and to2l, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them. 
Give ye now co2mandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another co2mandment sha2l be given from me. 
Take h2ed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings? 
Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' le2ter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power. 
Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia. 
Then the prophets, Ha2gai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of I2do, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them. 
Then rose up Zeru2babel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping them. 
At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath co2manded you to build this house, and to make up this wa2l? 
Then said we unto them after this ma2ner, What are the names of the men that make this building? 
But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, ti2l the ma2ter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by le2ter concerning this ma2ter. 
The copy of the le2ter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai and his companions the Apharsachites, which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king: 
They sent a le2ter unto him, wherein was wri2ten thus; Unto Darius the king, a2l peace. 
Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the wa2ls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands. 
Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who co2manded you to build this house, and to make up these wa2ls? 
We asked their names also, to certify th2e, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them. 
And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up. 
But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadne2zar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and ca2ried the people away into Babylon. 
But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decr2e to build this house of God. 
And the ve2sels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadne2zar t2ok out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshba2zar, whom he had made governor; 
And said unto him, Take these ve2sels, go, ca2ry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place. 
Then came the same Sheshba2zar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it b2en in building, and yet it is not finished. 
Now therefore, if it s2em g2od to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decr2e was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this ma2ter. 
Then Darius the king made a decr2e, and search was made in the house of the ro2ls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon. 
And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a ro2l, and therein was a record thus wri2ten: 
In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decr2e concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be builded, the place where they o2fered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof thr2escore cubits, and the breadth thereof thr2escore cubits; 
With thr2e rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house: 
And also let the golden and silver ve2sels of the house of God, which Nebuchadne2zar t2ok forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them in the house of God. 
Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from thence: 
Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place. 
Moreover I make a decr2e what ye sha2l do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's g2ods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered. 
And that which they have n2ed of, both young bu2locks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt o2ferings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, a2cording to the a2pointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail: 
That they may o2fer sacrifices of sw2et savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons. 
Also I have made a decr2e, that whosoever sha2l alter this word, let timber be pu2led down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghi2l for this. 
And the God that hath caused his name to dwe2l there destroy a2l kings and people, that sha2l put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decr2e; let it be done with sp2ed. 
Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and their companions, a2cording to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did sp2edily. 
And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Ha2gai the prophet and Zechariah the son of I2do. And they builded, and finished it, a2cording to the co2mandment of the God of Israel, and a2cording to the co2mandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. 
And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king. 
And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy. 
And o2fered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bu2locks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin o2fering for a2l Israel, twelve he goats, a2cording to the number of the tribes of Israel. 
And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is wri2ten in the b2ok of Moses. 
And the children of the captivity kept the pa2sover upon the fourt2enth day of the first month. 
For the priests and the Levites were purified together, a2l of them were pure, and ki2led the pa2sover for a2l the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves. 
And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and a2l such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthine2s of the heathen of the land, to s2ek the LORD God of Israel, did eat, 
And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of A2syria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel. 
Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, 
The son of Sha2lum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, 
The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth, 
The son of Zerahiah, the son of U2zi, the son of Bu2ki, 
The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest: 
This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted him a2l his request, a2cording to the hand of the LORD his God upon him. 
And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king. 
And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king. 
For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, a2cording to the g2od hand of his God upon him. 
For Ezra had prepared his heart to s2ek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments. 
Now this is the copy of the le2ter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the co2mandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel. 
Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a time. 
I make a decr2e, that a2l they of the people of Israel, and of his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own fr2ewi2l to go up to Jerusalem, go with th2e. 
Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counse2lors, to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, a2cording to the law of thy God which is in thine hand; 
And to ca2ry the silver and gold, which the king and his counse2lors have fr2ely o2fered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem, 
And a2l the silver and gold that thou canst find in a2l the province of Babylon, with the fr2ewi2l o2fering of the people, and of the priests, o2fering wi2lingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem: 
That thou mayest buy sp2edily with this money bu2locks, rams, lambs, with their meat o2ferings and their drink o2ferings, and o2fer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem. 
And whatsoever sha2l s2em g2od to th2e, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the wi2l of your God. 
The ve2sels also that are given th2e for the service of the house of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem. 
And whatsoever more sha2l be n2edful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have o2casion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure house. 
And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decr2e to a2l the treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, sha2l require of you, it be done sp2edily, 
Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much. 
Whatsoever is co2manded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons? 
Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it sha2l not be lawful to impose to2l, tribute, or custom, upon them. 
And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge a2l the people that are beyond the river, a2l such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know them not. 
And whosoever wi2l not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed sp2edily upon him, whether it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of g2ods, or to imprisonment. 
Ble2sed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem: 
And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counse2lors, and before a2l the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me. 
These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king. 
Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel: of the sons of David; Ha2tush. 
Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty. 
Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males. 
Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him thr2e hundred males. 
Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males. 
And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males. 
And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him fourscore males. 
Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eight2en males. 
And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him an hundred and thr2escore males. 
And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight males. 
And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Ha2katan, and with him an hundred and ten males. 
And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them thr2escore males. 
Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Za2bud, and with them seventy males. 
And I gathered them together to the river that ru2neth to Ahava; and there abode we in tents thr2e days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi. 
Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshu2lam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding. 
And I sent them with co2mandment unto I2do the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto I2do, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God. 
And by the g2od hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eight2en; 
And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty; 
Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had a2pointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: a2l of them were expre2sed by name. 
Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might a2flict ourselves before our God, to s2ek of him a right way for us, and for our li2tle ones, and for a2l our substance. 
For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon a2l them for g2od that s2ek him; but his power and his wrath is against a2l them that forsake him. 
So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us. 
Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them, 
And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the ve2sels, even the o2fering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counse2lors, and his lords, and a2l Israel there present, had o2fered: 
I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver ve2sels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred talents; 
Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two ve2sels of fine co2per, precious as gold. 
And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the ve2sels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a fr2ewi2l o2fering unto the LORD God of your fathers. 
Watch ye, and k2ep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD. 
So t2ok the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the ve2sels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God. 
Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way. 
And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there thr2e days. 
Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the ve2sels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Bi2nui, Levites; 
By number and by weight of every one: and a2l the weight was wri2ten at that time. 
Also the children of those that had b2en ca2ried away, which were come out of the captivity, o2fered burnt o2ferings unto the God of Israel, twelve bu2locks for a2l Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin o2fering: a2l this was a burnt o2fering unto the LORD. 
And they delivered the king's co2mi2sions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God. 
Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing a2cording to their abominations, even of the Can2anites, the Hi2tites, the Peri2zites, the Jebusites, the A2monites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. 
For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy s2ed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath b2en chief in this trespa2s. 
And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked o2f the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied. 
Then were a2sembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgre2sion of those that had b2en ca2ried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice. 
And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heavine2s; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fe2l upon my kn2es, and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God, 
And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to th2e, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespa2s is grown up unto the heavens. 
Since the days of our fathers have we b2en in a great trespa2s unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, b2en delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day. 
And now for a li2tle space grace hath b2en shewed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a li2tle reviving in our bondage. 
For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wa2l in Judah and in Jerusalem. 
And now, O our God, what sha2l we say after this? for we have forsaken thy co2mandments, 
Which thou hast co2manded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to po2se2s it, is an unclean land with the filthine2s of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have fi2led it from one end to another with their unclea2ne2s. 
Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor s2ek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the g2od of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever. 
And after a2l that is come upon us for our evil d2eds, and for our great trespa2s, s2eing that thou our God hast punished us le2s than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such deliverance as this; 
Should we again break thy co2mandments, and join in a2finity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us ti2l thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping? 
O LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before th2e in our trespa2ses: for we ca2not stand before th2e because of this. 
Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confe2sed, w2eping and casting himself down before the house of God, there a2sembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore. 
And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespa2sed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing. 
Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away a2l the wives, and such as are born of them, a2cording to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the co2mandment of our God; and let it be done a2cording to the law. 
Arise; for this ma2ter belongeth unto th2e: we also wi2l be with th2e: be of g2od courage, and do it. 
Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and a2l Israel, to swear that they should do a2cording to this word. And they sware. 
Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgre2sion of them that had b2en ca2ried away. 
And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto a2l the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem; 
And that whosoever would not come within thr2e days, a2cording to the counsel of the princes and the elders, a2l his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had b2en ca2ried away. 
Then a2l the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within thr2e days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and a2l the people sat in the str2et of the house of God, trembling because of this ma2ter, and for the great rain. 
And Ezra the priest st2od up, and said unto them, Ye have transgre2sed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespa2s of Israel. 
Now therefore make confe2sion unto the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives. 
Then a2l the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do. 
But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgre2sed in this thing. 
Let now our rulers of a2l the congregation stand, and let a2l them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at a2pointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this ma2ter be turned from us. 
Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this ma2ter: and Meshu2lam and Sha2bethai the Levite helped them. 
And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and a2l of them by their names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the ma2ter. 
And they made an end with a2l the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month. 
And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; M2aseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah. 
And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they o2fered a ram of the flock for their trespa2s. 
And of the sons of I2mer; Hanani, and Zebadiah. 
And of the sons of Harim; M2aseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and Jehiel, and U2ziah. 
And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, M2aseiah, Ishmael, Nethan2el, Jozabad, and Elasah. 
Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, (the same is Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer. 
Of the singers also; Eliashib: and of the porters; Sha2lum, and Telem, and Uri. 
Moreover of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah, and Malchiah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah. 
And of the sons of Elam; Ma2taniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Eliah. 
And of the sons of Za2tu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Ma2taniah, and Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza. 
Of the sons also of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Za2bai, and Athlai. 
And of the sons of Bani; Meshu2lam, Ma2luch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth. 
And of the sons of Pahathmoab; Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, M2aseiah, Ma2taniah, Bezal2el, and Bi2nui, and Mana2seh. 
And of the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah, Shemaiah, Shimeon, 
Benjamin, Ma2luch, and Shemariah. 
Of the sons of Hashum; Ma2tenai, Ma2tathah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Mana2seh, and Shimei. 
Of the sons of Bani; M2adai, Amram, and Uel, 
Benaiah, Bedeiah, Che2luh, 
Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib, 
Ma2taniah, Ma2tenai, and J2asau, 
And Bani, and Bi2nui, Shimei, 
And Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah, 
Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai, 
Azar2el, and Shelemiah, Shemariah, 
Sha2lum, Amariah, and Joseph. 
Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Ma2tithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau, and Joel, Benaiah. 
A2l these had taken strange wives: and some of them had wives by whom they had children. 
The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pa2s in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace, 
That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. 
And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great a2fliction and reproach: the wa2l of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire. 
And it came to pa2s, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven, 
And said, I bes2ech th2e, O LORD God of heaven, the great and te2rible God, that k2epeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his co2mandments: 
Let thine ear now be a2tentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before th2e now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confe2s the sins of the children of Israel, which we have si2ned against th2e: both I and my father's house have si2ned. 
We have dealt very co2ruptly against th2e, and have not kept the co2mandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou co2mandedst thy servant Moses. 
Remember, I bes2ech th2e, the word that thou co2mandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye transgre2s, I wi2l sca2ter you abroad among the nations: 
But if ye turn unto me, and k2ep my co2mandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the u2termost part of the heaven, yet wi2l I gather them from thence, and wi2l bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there. 
Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast red2emed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand. 
O LORD, I bes2ech th2e, let now thine ear be a2tentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray th2e, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer. 
And it came to pa2s in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I t2ok up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not b2en beforetime sad in his presence. 
Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, s2eing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but so2row of heart. Then I was very sore afraid, 
And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire? 
Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven. 
And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it. 
And the king said unto me, (the qu2en also si2ting by him,) For how long sha2l thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time. 
Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let le2ters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over ti2l I come into Judah; 
And a le2ter unto Asaph the k2eper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which a2pertained to the house, and for the wa2l of the city, and for the house that I sha2l enter into. And the king granted me, a2cording to the g2od hand of my God upon me. 
Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king's le2ters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me. 
When Sanba2lat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the A2monite, heard of it, it grieved them exc2edingly that there was come a man to s2ek the welfare of the children of Israel. 
So I came to Jerusalem, and was there thr2e days. 
And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon. 
And I went out by night by the gate of the va2ley, even before the dragon we2l, and to the dung port, and viewed the wa2ls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire. 
Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's p2ol: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pa2s. 
Then went I up in the night by the br2ok, and viewed the wa2l, and turned back, and entered by the gate of the va2ley, and so returned. 
And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work. 
Then said I unto them, Ye s2e the distre2s that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wa2l of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach. 
Then I told them of the hand of my God which was g2od upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this g2od work. 
But when Sanba2lat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the A2monite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? wi2l ye rebel against the king? 
Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he wi2l prosper us; therefore we his servants wi2l arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem. 
Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sh2ep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the d2ors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hanan2el. 
And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded Za2cur the son of Imri. 
But the fish gate did the sons of Ha2sen2ah build, who also laid the beams thereof, and set up the d2ors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof. 
And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of Koz. And next unto them repaired Meshu2lam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezab2el. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of B2ana. 
And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their LORD. 
Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshu2lam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the d2ors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof. 
And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the throne of the governor on this side the river. 
Next unto him repaired U2ziel the son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths. Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of one of the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wa2l. 
And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem. 
And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even over against his house. And next unto him repaired Ha2tush the son of Hashabniah. 
Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahathmoab, repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces. 
And next unto him repaired Sha2lum the son of Halohesh, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters. 
The va2ley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the d2ors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wa2l unto the dung gate. 
But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the ruler of part of Bet2ha2cerem; he built it, and set up the d2ors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof. 
But the gate of the fountain repaired Sha2lun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the d2ors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wa2l of the p2ol of Siloah by the king's garden, and unto the stairs that go down from the city of David. 
After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the half part of Bethzur, unto the place over against the sepulchres of David, and to the p2ol that was made, and unto the house of the mighty. 
After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of the half part of Keilah, in his part. 
After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad, the ruler of the half part of Keilah. 
And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning of the wa2l. 
After him Baruch the son of Za2bai earnestly repaired the other piece, from the turning of the wa2l unto the d2or of the house of Eliashib the high priest. 
After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz another piece, from the d2or of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib. 
And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain. 
After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub over against their house. After him repaired Azariah the son of M2aseiah the son of Ananiah by his house. 
After him repaired Bi2nui the son of Henadad another piece, from the house of Azariah unto the turning of the wa2l, even unto the corner. 
Palal the son of Uzai, over against the turning of the wa2l, and the tower which lieth out from the king's high house, that was by the court of the prison. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh. 
Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that lieth out. 
After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the great tower that lieth out, even unto the wa2l of Ophel. 
From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his house. 
After them repaired Zadok the son of I2mer over against his house. After him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah, the k2eper of the east gate. 
After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, another piece. After him repaired Meshu2lam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber. 
After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith's son unto the place of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad, and to the going up of the corner. 
And betw2en the going up of the corner unto the sh2ep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants. 
But it came to pa2s, that when Sanba2lat heard that we builded the wa2l, he was wroth, and t2ok great indignation, and mocked the Jews. 
And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these f2eble Jews? wi2l they fortify themselves? wi2l they sacrifice? wi2l they make an end in a day? wi2l they revive the stones out of the heaps of the ru2bish which are burned? 
Now Tobiah the A2monite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he sha2l even break down their stone wa2l. 
Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity: 
And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blo2ted out from before th2e: for they have provoked th2e to anger before the builders. 
So built we the wa2l; and a2l the wa2l was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work. 
But it came to pa2s, that when Sanba2lat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the A2monites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the wa2ls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be sto2ped, then they were very wroth, 
And conspired a2l of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it. 
Neverthele2s we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them. 
And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much ru2bish; so that we are not able to build the wa2l. 
And our adversaries said, They sha2l not know, neither s2e, ti2l we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease. 
And it came to pa2s, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times, From a2l places whence ye sha2l return unto us they wi2l be upon you. 
Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wa2l, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows. 
And I l2oked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the LORD, which is great and te2rible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses. 
And it came to pa2s, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned a2l of us to the wa2l, every one unto his work. 
And it came to pa2s from that time forth, that the half of my servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind a2l the house of Judah. 
They which builded on the wa2l, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon. 
For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me. 
And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wa2l, one far from another. 
In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God sha2l fight for us. 
So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning ti2l the stars a2peared. 
Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day. 
So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which fo2lowed me, none of us put o2f our clothes, saving that every one put them o2f for washing. 
And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews. 
For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live. 
Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth. 
There were also that said, We have bo2rowed money for the king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards. 
Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to red2em them; for other men have our lands and vineyards. 
And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words. 
Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a great a2sembly against them. 
And I said unto them, We after our ability have red2emed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and wi2l ye even se2l your brethren? or sha2l they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer. 
Also I said, It is not g2od that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies? 
I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave o2f this usury. 
Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them. 
Then said they, We wi2l restore them, and wi2l require nothing of them; so wi2l we do as thou sayest. Then I ca2led the priests, and t2ok an oath of them, that they should do a2cording to this promise. 
Also I sh2ok my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And a2l the congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did a2cording to this promise. 
Moreover from the time that I was a2pointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor. 
But the former governors that had b2en before me were chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God. 
Yea, also I continued in the work of this wa2l, neither bought we any land: and a2l my servants were gathered thither unto the work. 
Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us. 
Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sh2ep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of a2l sorts of wine: yet for a2l this required not I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people. 
Think upon me, my God, for g2od, a2cording to a2l that I have done for this people. 
Now it came to pa2s when Sanba2lat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wa2l, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the d2ors upon the gates;) 
That Sanba2lat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us m2et together in some one of the vi2lages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief. 
And I sent me2sengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I ca2not come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you? 
Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same ma2ner. 
Then sent Sanba2lat his servant unto me in like ma2ner the fifth time with an open le2ter in his hand; 
Wherein was wri2ten, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wa2l, that thou mayest be their king, a2cording to these words. 
And thou hast also a2pointed prophets to preach of th2e at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now sha2l it be reported to the king a2cording to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together. 
Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart. 
For they a2l made us afraid, saying, Their hands sha2l be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands. 
Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetab2el, who was shut up; and he said, Let us m2et together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the d2ors of the temple: for they wi2l come to slay th2e; yea, in the night wi2l they come to slay th2e. 
And I said, Should such a man as I fl2e? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I wi2l not go in. 
And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanba2lat had hired him. 
Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have ma2ter for an evil report, that they might reproach me. 
My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanba2lat a2cording to these their works, and on the prophete2s Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear. 
So the wa2l was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days. 
And it came to pa2s, that when a2l our enemies heard thereof, and a2l the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God. 
Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many le2ters unto Tobiah, and the le2ters of Tobiah came unto them. 
For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshu2lam the son of Berechiah. 
Also they reported his g2od d2eds before me, and u2tered my words to him. And Tobiah sent le2ters to put me in fear. 
Now it came to pa2s, when the wa2l was built, and I had set up the d2ors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were a2pointed, 
That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many. 
And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the d2ors, and bar them: and a2point watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house. 
Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded. 
And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found wri2ten therein, 
These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had b2en ca2ried away, whom Nebuchadne2zar the king of Babylon had ca2ried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city; 
Who came with Zeru2babel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, R2amiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, B2anah. The number, I say, of the men of the people of Israel was this; 
The children of Parosh, two thousand an hundred seventy and two. 
The children of Shephatiah, thr2e hundred seventy and two. 
The children of Arah, six hundred fifty and two. 
The children of Pahathmoab, of the children of Jeshua and Joab, two thousand and eight hundred and eight2en. 
The children of Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four. 
The children of Za2tu, eight hundred forty and five. 
The children of Za2cai, seven hundred and thr2escore. 
The children of Bi2nui, six hundred forty and eight. 
The children of Bebai, six hundred twenty and eight. 
The children of Azgad, two thousand thr2e hundred twenty and two. 
The children of Adonikam, six hundred thr2escore and seven. 
The children of Bigvai, two thousand thr2escore and seven.

The men of Anathoth, an hundred twenty and eight. 
The men of Bethazmaveth, forty and two. 
The men of Kirjathjearim, Chephirah, and B2eroth, seven hundred forty and thr2e. 
The men of Ramah and Gaba, six hundred twenty and one. 
The men of Michmas, an hundred and twenty and two. 
The men of Bethel and Ai, an hundred twenty and thr2e. 
The men of the other Nebo, fifty and two. 
The children of the other Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four. 
The children of Harim, thr2e hundred and twenty. 
The children of Jericho, thr2e hundred forty and five. 
The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and one. 
The children of Sen2ah, thr2e thousand nine hundred and thirty. 
The priests: the children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred seventy and thr2e. 
The children of I2mer, a thousand fifty and two. 
The children of Pashur, a thousand two hundred forty and seven. 
The children of Harim, a thousand and sevent2en. 
The Levites: the children of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, and of the children of Hodevah, seventy and four. 
The singers: the children of Asaph, an hundred forty and eight. 
The porters: the children of Sha2lum, the children of Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of A2kub, the children of Hatita, the children of Shobai, an hundred thirty and eight. 
The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hashupha, the children of Ta2baoth, 
The children of Keros, the children of Sia, the children of Padon, 
The children of Lebana, the children of Hagaba, the children of Shalmai, 
The children of Hanan, the children of Gi2del, the children of Gahar, 
The children of Reaiah, the children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda, 
The children of Ga2zam, the children of U2za, the children of Phaseah, 
The children of Besai, the children of Meunim, the children of Nephishesim, 
The children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of Harhur, 
The children of Bazlith, the children of Mehida, the children of Harsha, 
The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Tamah, 
The children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha. 
The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Perida, 
The children of J2ala, the children of Darkon, the children of Gi2del, 
The children of Shephatiah, the children of Ha2til, the children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Amon. 
A2l the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, were thr2e hundred ninety and two. 
And these were they which went up also from Telmelah, Telharesha, Cherub, A2don, and I2mer: but they could not shew their father's house, nor their s2ed, whether they were of Israel. 
The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two. 
And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzi2lai, which t2ok one of the daughters of Barzi2lai the Gileadite to wife, and was ca2led after their name. 
These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as po2luted, put from the priesth2od. 
And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, ti2l there st2od up a priest with Urim and Thu2mim. 
The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand thr2e hundred and thr2escore, 
Beside their manservants and their maidservants, of whom there were seven thousand thr2e hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women. 
Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two hundred forty and five: 
Their camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand seven hundred and twenty a2ses. 
And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basons, five hundred and thirty priests' garments. 
And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver. 
And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and thr2escore and seven priests' garments. 
So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and a2l Israel, dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month came, the children of Israel were in their cities. 
And a2l the people gathered themselves together as one man into the str2et that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the b2ok of the law of Moses, which the LORD had co2manded to Israel. 
And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and a2l that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month. 
And he read therein before the str2et that was before the water gate from the morning until mi2day, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of a2l the people were a2tentive unto the b2ok of the law. 
And Ezra the scribe st2od upon a pulpit of w2od, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him st2od Ma2tithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and M2aseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshu2lam. 
And Ezra opened the b2ok in the sight of a2l the people; (for he was above a2l the people;) and when he opened it, a2l the people st2od up: 
And Ezra ble2sed the LORD, the great God. And a2l the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshi2ped the LORD with their faces to the ground. 
Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, A2kub, Sha2bethai, Hodijah, M2aseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people st2od in their place. 
So they read in the b2ok in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading. 
And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto a2l the people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor w2ep. For a2l the people wept, when they heard the words of the law. 
Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sw2et, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our LORD: neither be ye so2ry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength. 
So the Levites sti2led a2l the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved. 
And a2l the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had underst2od the words that were declared unto them. 
And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of a2l the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law. 
And they found wri2ten in the law which the LORD had co2manded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwe2l in b2oths in the feast of the seventh month: 
And that they should publish and proclaim in a2l their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick tr2es, to make b2oths, as it is wri2ten. 
So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves b2oths, every one upon the r2of of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the str2et of the water gate, and in the str2et of the gate of Ephraim. 
And a2l the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made b2oths, and sat under the b2oths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladne2s. 
Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the b2ok of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn a2sembly, a2cording unto the ma2ner. 
Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were a2sembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them. 
And the s2ed of Israel separated themselves from a2l strangers, and st2od and confe2sed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers. 
And they st2od up in their place, and read in the b2ok of the law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confe2sed, and worshi2ped the LORD their God. 
Then st2od up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bu2ni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God. 
Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and ble2s the LORD your God for ever and ever: and ble2sed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above a2l ble2sing and praise. 
Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with a2l their host, the earth, and a2l things that are therein, the seas, and a2l that is therein, and thou preservest them a2l; and the host of heaven worshi2peth th2e. 
Thou art the LORD the God, who didst ch2ose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chald2es, and gavest him the name of Abraham; 
And foundest his heart faithful before th2e, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Can2anites, the Hi2tites, the Amorites, and the Peri2zites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his s2ed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous: 
And didst s2e the a2fliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea; 
And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on a2l his servants, and on a2l the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get th2e a name, as it is this day. 
And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the d2eps, as a stone into the mighty waters. 
Moreover thou le2dest them in the day by a cloudy pi2lar; and in the night by a pi2lar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go. 
Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, g2od statutes and co2mandments: 
And madest known unto them thy holy sa2bath, and co2mandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant: 
And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to po2se2s the land which thou hadst sworn to give them. 
But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy co2mandments, 
And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebe2lion a2pointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindne2s, and fors2okest them not. 
Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought th2e up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations; 
Yet thou in thy manifold mercies fors2okest them not in the wilderne2s: the pi2lar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pi2lar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go. 
Thou gavest also thy g2od spirit to instruct them, and wit2heldest not thy ma2na from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst. 
Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderne2s, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their f2et swe2led not. 
Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they po2se2sed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan. 
Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to po2se2s it. 
So the children went in and po2se2sed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Can2anites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would. 
And they t2ok strong cities, and a fat land, and po2se2sed houses fu2l of a2l g2ods, we2ls di2ged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit tr2es in abundance: so they did eat, and were fi2led, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great g2odne2s. 
Neverthele2s they were disobedient, and rebe2led against th2e, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to th2e, and they wrought great provocations. 
Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto th2e, thou heardest them from heaven; and a2cording to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies. 
But after they had rest, they did evil again before th2e: therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto th2e, thou heardest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them a2cording to thy mercies; 
And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy co2mandments, but si2ned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he sha2l live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear. 
Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands. 
Neverthele2s for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not u2terly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God. 
Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the te2rible God, who k2epest covenant and mercy, let not a2l the trouble s2em li2tle before th2e, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on a2l thy people, since the time of the kings of A2syria unto this day. 
Howbeit thou art just in a2l that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly: 
Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy co2mandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them. 
For they have not served th2e in their kingdom, and in thy great g2odne2s that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works. 
Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the g2od thereof, behold, we are servants in it: 
And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our ca2tle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distre2s. 
And because of a2l this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it. 
Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah, 
Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah, 
Pashur, Amariah, Malchijah, 
Ha2tush, Shebaniah, Ma2luch,

And their brethren, Shebaniah, Hodijah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,

Rehum, Hashabnah, M2aseiah, 
And Ahijah, Hanan, Anan, 
Ma2luch, Harim, B2anah. 
And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters, the singers, the Nethinims, and a2l they that had separated themselves from the people of the lands unto the law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every one having knowledge, and having understanding; 
They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do a2l the co2mandments of the LORD our Lord, and his judgments and his statutes; 
And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land, not take their daughters for our sons: 
And if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sa2bath day to se2l, that we would not buy it of them on the sa2bath, or on the holy day: and that we would leave the seventh year, and the exaction of every debt. 
Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God; 
For the shewbread, and for the continual meat o2fering, and for the continual burnt o2fering, of the sa2baths, of the new m2ons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin o2ferings to make an atonement for Israel, and for a2l the work of the house of our God. 
And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the w2od o2fering, to bring it into the house of our God, after the houses of our fathers, at times a2pointed year by year, to burn upon the altar of the LORD our God, as it is wri2ten in the law: 
And to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the firstfruits of a2l fruit of a2l tr2es, year by year, unto the house of the LORD: 
Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our ca2tle, as it is wri2ten in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks, to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests that minister in the house of our God: 
And that we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our o2ferings, and the fruit of a2l ma2ner of tr2es, of wine and of oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites, that the same Levites might have the tithes in a2l the cities of our ti2lage. 
And the priest the son of Aaron sha2l be with the Levites, when the Levites take tithes: and the Levites sha2l bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God, to the chambers, into the treasure house. 
For the children of Israel and the children of Levi sha2l bring the o2fering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil, unto the chambers, where are the ve2sels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers: and we wi2l not forsake the house of our God. 
And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwe2l in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts to dwe2l in other cities. 
And the people ble2sed a2l the men, that wi2lingly o2fered themselves to dwe2l at Jerusalem. 
Now these are the chief of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his po2se2sion in their cities, to wit, Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants. 
And at Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin. Of the children of Judah; Athaiah the son of U2ziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalal2el, of the children of Perez; 
And M2aseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Colhozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of Shiloni.

And these are the sons of Benjamin; Sa2lu the son of Meshu2lam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of M2aseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jesaiah. 
And after him Ga2bai, Sa2lai, nine hundred twenty and eight.

Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin. 
Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshu2lam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, was the ruler of the house of God.

And his brethren, chief of the fathers, two hundred forty and two: and Amashai the son of Azar2el, the son of Ahasai, the son of Meshi2lemoth, the son of I2mer, 
And their brethren, mighty men of valour, an hundred twenty and eight: and their overs2er was Zabdiel, the son of one of the great men. 
Also of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hashub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bu2ni; 
And Sha2bethai and Jozabad, of the chief of the Levites, had the oversight of the outward busine2s of the house of God. 
And Ma2taniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, was the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer: and Bakbukiah the second among his brethren, and Abda the son of Sha2mua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun. 
A2l the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore and four. 
Moreover the porters, A2kub, Talmon, and their brethren that kept the gates, were an hundred seventy and two. 
And the residue of Israel, of the priests, and the Levites, were in a2l the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance. 
But the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha and Gispa were over the Nethinims. 
The overs2er also of the Levites at Jerusalem was U2zi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Ma2taniah, the son of Micha. Of the sons of Asaph, the singers were over the busine2s of the house of God. 
For it was the king's co2mandment concerning them, that a certain portion should be for the singers, due for every day. 
And Pethahiah the son of Meshezab2el, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, was at the king's hand in a2l ma2ters concerning the people. 
And for the vi2lages, with their fields, some of the children of Judah dwelt at Kirjatharba, and in the vi2lages thereof, and at Dibon, and in the vi2lages thereof, and at Jekabz2el, and in the vi2lages thereof, 
And at Jeshua, and at Moladah, and at Bethphelet, 
And at Hazarshual, and at B2ersheba, and in the vi2lages thereof,

And at Enri2mon, and at Zareah, and at Jarmuth, 
Zanoah, Adu2lam, and in their vi2lages, at Lachish, and the fields thereof, at Azekah, and in the vi2lages thereof. And they dwelt from B2ersheba unto the va2ley of Hi2nom. 
The children also of Benjamin from Geba dwelt at Michmash, and Aija, and Bethel, and in their vi2lages. 
And at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, 
Hazor, Ramah, Gi2taim, 
Hadid, Zeboim, Neba2lat, 
Lod, and Ono, the va2ley of craftsmen. 
And of the Levites were divisions in Judah, and in Benjamin. 
Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with Zeru2babel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, 
Amariah, Ma2luch, Ha2tush, 
Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,

Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Bi2nui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Ma2taniah, which was over the thanksgiving, he and his brethren. 
Also Bakbukiah and U2ni, their brethren, were over against them in the watches. 
And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and Eliashib begat Joiada,

Of Bilgah, Sha2mua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan; 
And of Joiarib, Ma2tenai; of Jedaiah, U2zi; 
Of Sa2lai, Ka2lai; of Amok, Eber; 
Of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethan2el. 
The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Ja2dua, were recorded chief of the fathers: also the priests, to the reign of Darius the Persian. 
The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were wri2ten in the b2ok of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib. 
And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise and to give thanks, a2cording to the co2mandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward. 
Ma2taniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshu2lam, Talmon, A2kub, were porters k2eping the ward at the thresholds of the gates. 
These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe. 
And at the dedication of the wa2l of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of a2l their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to k2ep the dedication with gladne2s, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps. 
And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the vi2lages of Netophathi; 
Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them vi2lages round about Jerusalem. 
And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wa2l. 
Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wa2l, and a2pointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right hand upon the wa2l toward the dung gate: 
And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah, 
And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshu2lam, 
Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah, 
And certain of the priests' sons with trumpets; namely, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Ma2taniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Za2cur, the son of Asaph: 
And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, M2ai, Nethan2el, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them. 
And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wa2l, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward. 
And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wa2l, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wa2l; 
And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hanan2el, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sh2ep gate: and they st2od sti2l in the prison gate. 
So st2od the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me: 
And the priests; Eliakim, M2aseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets; 
And M2aseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and U2zi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overs2er. 
Also that day they o2fered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar o2f. 
And at that time were some a2pointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the o2ferings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited. 
And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, a2cording to the co2mandment of David, and of Solomon his son. 
For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God. 
And a2l Israel in the days of Zeru2babel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children of Aaron. 
On that day they read in the b2ok of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found wri2ten, that the A2monite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever; 
Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Bal2am against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a ble2sing. 
Now it came to pa2s, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel a2l the mixed multitude. 
And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was a2lied unto Tobiah: 
And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meat o2ferings, the frankincense, and the ve2sels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was co2manded to be given to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the o2ferings of the priests. 
But in a2l this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king: 
And I came to Jerusalem, and underst2od of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God. 
And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth a2l the household stu2f to Tobiah out of the chamber. 
Then I co2manded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the ve2sels of the house of God, with the meat o2fering and the frankincense. 
And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not b2en given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field. 
Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place. 
Then brought a2l Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries. 
And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Za2cur, the son of Ma2taniah: for they were counted faithful, and their o2fice was to distribute unto their brethren. 
Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my g2od d2eds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the o2fices thereof. 
In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine pre2ses on the sa2bath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading a2ses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and a2l ma2ner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sa2bath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals. 
There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and a2l ma2ner of ware, and sold on the sa2bath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. 
Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sa2bath day? 
Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring a2l this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sa2bath. 
And it came to pa2s, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sa2bath, I co2manded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened ti2l after the sa2bath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sa2bath day. 
So the merchants and se2lers of a2l kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice. 
Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wa2l? if ye do so again, I wi2l lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sa2bath. 
And I co2manded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and k2ep the gates, to sanctify the sa2bath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me a2cording to the greatne2s of thy mercy. 
In those days also saw I Jews that had ma2ried wives of Ashdod, of A2mon, and of Moab: 
And their children spake half in the sp2ech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but a2cording to the language of each people. 
And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked o2f their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye sha2l not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves. 
Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over a2l Israel: neverthele2s even him did outlandish women cause to sin. 
Sha2l we then hearken unto you to do a2l this great evil, to transgre2s against our God in ma2rying strange wives? 
And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanba2lat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me. 
Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesth2od, and the covenant of the priesth2od, and of the Levites. 
Thus cleansed I them from a2l strangers, and a2pointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his busine2s; 
And for the w2od o2fering, at times a2pointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for g2od. 
Now it came to pa2s in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:) 
That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace, 
In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto a2l his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him: 
When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his exce2lent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore days. 
And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto a2l the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and sma2l, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace; 
Where were white, gr2en, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pi2lars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble. 
And they gave them drink in ve2sels of gold, (the ve2sels being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, a2cording to the state of the king. 
And the drinking was a2cording to the law; none did compel: for so the king had a2pointed to a2l the o2ficers of his house, that they should do a2cording to every man's pleasure. 
Also Vashti the qu2en made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus. 
On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was me2ry with wine, he co2manded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king, 
To bring Vashti the qu2en before the king with the crown royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to l2ok on. 
But the qu2en Vashti refused to come at the king's co2mandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger burned in him. 
Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for so was the king's ma2ner toward a2l that knew law and judgment: 
And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;) 
What sha2l we do unto the qu2en Vashti a2cording to law, because she hath not performed the co2mandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains? 
And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the qu2en hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to a2l the princes, and to a2l the people that are in a2l the provinces of the king Ahasuerus. 
For this d2ed of the qu2en sha2l come abroad unto a2l women, so that they sha2l despise their husbands in their eyes, when it sha2l be reported, The king Ahasuerus co2manded Vashti the qu2en to be brought in before him, but she came not. 
Likewise sha2l the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto a2l the king's princes, which have heard of the d2ed of the qu2en. Thus sha2l there arise t2o much contempt and wrath. 
If it please the king, let there go a royal co2mandment from him, and let it be wri2ten among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is be2ter than she. 
And when the king's decr2e which he sha2l make sha2l be published throughout a2l his empire, (for it is great,) a2l the wives sha2l give to their husbands honour, both to great and sma2l. 
And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did a2cording to the word of Memucan: 
For he sent le2ters into a2l the king's provinces, into every province a2cording to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published a2cording to the language of every people. 
After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was a2peased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decr2ed against her. 
Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king: 
And let the king a2point o2ficers in a2l the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together a2l the fair young virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, k2eper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them: 
And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be qu2en instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so. 
Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite; 
Who had b2en ca2ried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had b2en ca2ried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadne2zar the king of Babylon had ca2ried away. 
And he brought up Hada2sah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, t2ok for his own daughter. 
So it came to pa2s, when the king's co2mandment and his decr2e was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, k2eper of the women. 
And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindne2s of him; and he sp2edily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were m2et to be given her, out of the king's house: and he prefe2red her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women. 
Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it. 
And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her. 
Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had b2en twelve months, a2cording to the ma2ner of the women, (for so were the days of their purifications a2complished, to wit, six months with oil of my2rh, and six months with sw2et odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;) 
Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king's house. 
In the evening she went, and on the mo2row she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Sh2ashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were ca2led by name. 
Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the k2eper of the women, a2pointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of a2l them that l2oked upon her. 
So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign. 
And the king loved Esther above a2l the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than a2l the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her qu2en instead of Vashti. 
Then the king made a great feast unto a2l his princes and his servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, a2cording to the state of the king. 
And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king's gate. 
Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the co2mandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him. 
In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the d2or, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king Ahasuerus. 
And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the qu2en; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's name. 
And when inquisition was made of the ma2ter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tr2e: and it was wri2ten in the b2ok of the chronicles before the king. 
After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Ha2medatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above a2l the princes that were with him. 
And a2l the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so co2manded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence. 
Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said unto Mordecai, Why transgre2sest thou the king's co2mandment? 
Now it came to pa2s, when they spake daily unto him, and he hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to s2e whether Mordecai's ma2ters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew. 
And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence, then was Haman fu2l of wrath. 
And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy a2l the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai. 
In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar. 
And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people sca2tered abroad and dispersed among the people in a2l the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from a2l people; neither k2ep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to su2fer them. 
If it please the king, let it be wri2ten that they may be destroyed: and I wi2l pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the busine2s, to bring it into the king's treasuries. 
And the king t2ok his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman the son of Ha2medatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy. 
And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to th2e, the people also, to do with them as it s2emeth g2od to th2e. 
Then were the king's scribes ca2led on the thirt2enth day of the first month, and there was wri2ten a2cording to a2l that Haman had co2manded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province a2cording to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it wri2ten, and sealed with the king's ring. 
And the le2ters were sent by posts into a2l the king's provinces, to destroy, to ki2l, and to cause to perish, a2l Jews, both young and old, li2tle children and women, in one day, even upon the thirt2enth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey. 
The copy of the writing for a co2mandment to be given in every province was published unto a2l people, that they should be ready against that day. 
The posts went out, being hastened by the king's co2mandment, and the decr2e was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed. 
When Mordecai perceived a2l that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bi2ter cry; 
And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth. 
And in every province, whithersoever the king's co2mandment and his decr2e came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and w2eping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes. 
So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her. Then was the qu2en exc2edingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he received it not. 
Then ca2led Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains, whom he had a2pointed to a2tend upon her, and gave him a co2mandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was. 
So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the str2et of the city, which was before the king's gate. 
And Mordecai told him of a2l that had ha2pened unto him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them. 
Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decr2e that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther, and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should go in unto the king, to make su2plication unto him, and to make request before him for her people. 
And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai. 
Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him co2mandment unto Mordecai; 
A2l the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or women, sha2l come unto the king into the i2ner court, who is not ca2led, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king sha2l hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not b2en ca2led to come in unto the king these thirty days. 
And they told to Mordecai Esther's words. 
Then Mordecai co2manded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than a2l the Jews. 
For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then sha2l there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house sha2l be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this? 
Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer, 
Go, gather together a2l the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink thr2e days, night or day: I also and my maidens wi2l fast likewise; and so wi2l I go in unto the king, which is not a2cording to the law: and if I perish, I perish. 
So Mordecai went his way, and did a2cording to a2l that Esther had co2manded him. 
Now it came to pa2s on the third day, that Esther put on her royal a2parel, and st2od in the i2ner court of the king's house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house. 
And it was so, when the king saw Esther the qu2en standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre. 
Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, qu2en Esther? and what is thy request? it sha2l be even given th2e to the half of the kingdom. 
And Esther answered, If it s2em g2od unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him. 
Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared. 
And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it sha2l be granted th2e: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it sha2l be performed. 
Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is; 
If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I sha2l prepare for them, and I wi2l do to mo2row as the king hath said. 
Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he st2od not up, nor moved for him, he was fu2l of indignation against Mordecai. 
Neverthele2s Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and ca2led for his friends, and Zeresh his wife. 
And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and a2l the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king. 
Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the qu2en did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to mo2row am I invited unto her also with the king. 
Yet a2l this availeth me nothing, so long as I s2e Mordecai the Jew si2ting at the king's gate. 
Then said Zeresh his wife and a2l his friends unto him, Let a ga2lows be made of fifty cubits high, and to mo2row speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in me2rily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the ga2lows to be made. 
On that night could not the king sl2ep, and he co2manded to bring the b2ok of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king. 
And it was found wri2ten, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the k2epers of the d2or, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus. 
And the king said, What honour and dignity hath b2en done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him. 
And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the ga2lows that he had prepared for him. 
And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth in the court. And the king said, Let him come in. 
So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What sha2l be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself? 
And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delighteth to honour, 
Let the royal a2parel be brought which the king useth to wear, and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal which is set upon his head: 
And let this a2parel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may a2ray the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on horseback through the str2et of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus sha2l it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour. 
Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the a2parel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, that si2teth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of a2l that thou hast spoken. 
Then t2ok Haman the a2parel and the horse, and a2rayed Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the str2et of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus sha2l it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour. 
And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted to his house mourning, and having his head covered. 
And Haman told Zeresh his wife and a2l his friends every thing that had befa2len him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the s2ed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fa2l, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fa2l before him. 
And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that Esther had prepared. 
So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the qu2en. 
And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, qu2en Esther? and it sha2l be granted th2e: and what is thy request? and it sha2l be performed, even to the half of the kingdom. 
Then Esther the qu2en answered and said, If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request: 
For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had b2en sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage. 
Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the qu2en, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so? 
And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the qu2en. 
And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden: and Haman st2od up to make request for his life to Esther the qu2en; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king. 
Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fa2len upon the bed whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Wi2l he force the qu2en also before me in the house? As the word went out of king's mouth, they covered Haman's face. 
And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the ga2lows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who spoken g2od for the king, standeth in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon. 
So they hanged Haman on the ga2lows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified. 
On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the Jews' enemy unto Esther the qu2en. And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her. 
And the king t2ok o2f his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman. 
And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fe2l down at his f2et, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews. 
Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose, and st2od before the king, 
And said, If it please the king, and if I have favour in his sight, and the thing s2em right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be wri2ten to reverse the le2ters devised by Haman the son of Ha2medatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews which are in a2l the king's provinces: 
For how can I endure to s2e the evil that sha2l come unto my people? or how can I endure to s2e the destruction of my kindred? 
Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the qu2en and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the ga2lows, because he laid his hand upon the Jews. 
Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which is wri2ten in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring, may no man reverse. 
Then were the king's scribes ca2led at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the thr2e and twentieth day thereof; and it was wri2ten a2cording to a2l that Mordecai co2manded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every province a2cording to the writing thereof, and unto every people after their language, and to the Jews a2cording to their writing, and a2cording to their language. 
And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with the king's ring, and sent le2ters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries: 
Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay and to cause to perish, a2l the power of the people and province that would a2sault them, both li2tle ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey, 
Upon one day in a2l the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirt2enth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar. 
The copy of the writing for a co2mandment to be given in every province was published unto a2l people, and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies. 
So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being hastened and pre2sed on by the king's co2mandment. And the decr2e was given at Shushan the palace. 
And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal a2parel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad. 
The Jews had light, and gladne2s, and joy, and honour. 
And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the king's co2mandment and his decr2e came, the Jews had joy and gladne2s, a feast and a g2od day. And many of the people of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fe2l upon them. 
Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirt2enth day of the same, when the king's co2mandment and his decr2e drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;) 
The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout a2l the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fe2l upon a2l people. 
And a2l the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the deputies, and o2ficers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of Mordecai fe2l upon them. 
For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went out throughout a2l the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater. 
Thus the Jews smote a2l their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that hated them. 
And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men. 
And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha, 
And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha, 
And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha, 
The ten sons of Haman the son of Ha2medatha, the enemy of the Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand. 
On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace was brought before the king. 
And the king said unto Esther the qu2en, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? now what is thy petition? and it sha2l be granted th2e: or what is thy request further? and it sha2l be done. 
Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to mo2row also a2cording unto this day's decr2e, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged upon the ga2lows. 
And the king co2manded it so to be done: and the decr2e was given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons. 
For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourt2enth day also of the month Adar, and slew thr2e hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand. 
But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and st2od for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey, 
On the thirt2enth day of the month Adar; and on the fourt2enth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladne2s. 
But the Jews that were at Shushan a2sembled together on the thirt2enth day thereof, and on the fourt2enth thereof; and on the fift2enth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladne2s. 
Therefore the Jews of the vi2lages, that dwelt in the unwa2led towns, made the fourt2enth day of the month Adar a day of gladne2s and feasting, and a g2od day, and of sending portions one to another. 
And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent le2ters unto a2l the Jews that were in a2l the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and far, 
To stablish this among them, that they should k2ep the fourt2enth day of the month Adar, and the fift2enth day of the same, yearly, 
As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from so2row to joy, and from mourning into a g2od day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the p2or. 
And the Jews undert2ok to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had wri2ten unto them; 
Because Haman the son of Ha2medatha, the Agagite, the enemy of a2l the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them; 
But when Esther came before the king, he co2manded by le2ters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the ga2lows. 
Wherefore they ca2led these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore for a2l the words of this le2ter, and of that which they had s2en concerning this ma2ter, and which had come unto them, 
The Jews ordained, and t2ok upon them, and upon their s2ed, and upon a2l such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would k2ep these two days a2cording to their writing, and a2cording to their a2pointed time every year; 
And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their s2ed. 
Then Esther the qu2en, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with a2l authority, to confirm this second le2ter of Purim. 
And he sent the le2ters unto a2l the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth, 
To confirm these days of Purim in their times a2pointed, a2cording as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the qu2en had enjoined them, and as they had decr2ed for themselves and for their s2ed, the ma2ters of the fastings and their cry. 
And the decr2e of Esther confirmed these ma2ters of Purim; and it was wri2ten in the b2ok. 
And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon the isles of the sea. 
And a2l the acts of his power and of his might, and the declaration of the greatne2s of Mordecai, whereunto the king advanced him, are they not wri2ten in the b2ok of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia? 
For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and a2cepted of the multitude of his brethren, s2eking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to a2l his s2ed. 
There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil. 
And there were born unto him seven sons and thr2e daughters. 
His substance also was seven thousand sh2ep, and thr2e thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she a2ses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of a2l the men of the east. 
And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and ca2led for their thr2e sisters to eat and to drink with them. 
And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and o2fered burnt o2ferings a2cording to the number of them a2l: for Job said, It may be that my sons have si2ned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continua2ly. 
Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them. 
And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. 
And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? 
Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? 
Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about a2l that he hath on every side? thou hast ble2sed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. 
But put forth thine hand now, and touch a2l that he hath, and he wi2l curse th2e to thy face. 
And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, a2l that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD. 
And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: 
And there came a me2senger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the a2ses f2eding beside them: 
And the Sabeans fe2l upon them, and t2ok them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to te2l th2e. 
While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fa2len from heaven, and hath burned up the sh2ep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to te2l th2e. 
While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out thr2e bands, and fe2l upon the camels, and have ca2ried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to te2l th2e. 
While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: 
And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderne2s, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fe2l upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to te2l th2e. 
Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fe2l down upon the ground, and worshi2ped, 
And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked sha2l I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; ble2sed be the name of the LORD. 
In a2l this Job si2ned not, nor charged God f2olishly. 
Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD. 
And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. 
And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and sti2l he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause. 
And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, a2l that a man hath wi2l he give for his life. 
But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he wi2l curse th2e to thy face. 
And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life. 
So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his f2ot unto his crown. 
And he t2ok him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes. 
Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou sti2l retain thine integrity? curse God, and die. 
But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the f2olish women speaketh. What? sha2l we receive g2od at the hand of God, and sha2l we not receive evil? In a2l this did not Job sin with his lips. 
Now when Job's thr2e friends heard of a2l this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the N2amathite: for they had made an a2pointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him. 
And when they lifted up their eyes afar o2f, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. 
So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great. 
After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. 
And Job spake, and said, 
Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived. 
Let that day be darkne2s; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it. 
Let darkne2s and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwe2l upon it; let the blackne2s of the day te2rify it. 
As for that night, let darkne2s seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months. 
Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein. 
Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning. 
Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it l2ok for light, but have none; neither let it s2e the dawning of the day: 
Because it shut not up the d2ors of my mother's womb, nor hid so2row from mine eyes. 
Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the be2ly? 
Why did the kn2es prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck? 
For now should I have lain sti2l and b2en quiet, I should have slept: then had I b2en at rest, 
With kings and counse2lors of the earth, which build desolate places for themselves; 
Or with princes that had gold, who fi2led their houses with silver: 
Or as an hi2den untimely birth I had not b2en; as infants which never saw light. 
There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest. 
There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the o2pre2sor. 
The sma2l and great are there; and the servant is fr2e from his master. 
Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bi2ter in soul; 
Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures; 
Which rejoice exc2edingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave? 
Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in? 
For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters. 
For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me. 
I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came. 
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 
If we a2say to co2mune with th2e, wilt thou be grieved? but who can wit2hold himself from speaking? 
Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands. 
Thy words have upholden him that was fa2ling, and thou hast strengthened the f2eble kn2es. 
But now it is come upon th2e, and thou faintest; it toucheth th2e, and thou art troubled. 
Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightne2s of thy ways? 
Remember, I pray th2e, who ever perished, being i2nocent? or where were the righteous cut o2f? 
Even as I have s2en, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedne2s, reap the same. 
By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed. 
The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the t2eth of the young lions, are broken. 
The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are sca2tered abroad. 
Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a li2tle thereof. 
In thoughts from the visions of the night, when d2ep sl2ep fa2leth on men, 
Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made a2l my bones to shake. 
Then a spirit pa2sed before my face; the hair of my flesh st2od up: 
It st2od sti2l, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying, 
Sha2l mortal man be more just than God? sha2l a man be more pure than his maker? 
Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with fo2ly: 
How much le2s in them that dwe2l in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth? 
They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it. 
Doth not their exce2lency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom. 
Ca2l now, if there be any that wi2l answer th2e; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn? 
For wrath ki2leth the f2olish man, and envy slayeth the si2ly one. 
I have s2en the f2olish taking r2ot: but su2denly I cursed his habitation. 
His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them. 
Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the ro2ber swa2loweth up their substance. 
Although a2fliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground; 
Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward. 
I would s2ek unto God, and unto God would I co2mit my cause: 
Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marve2lous things without number: 
Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields: 
To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety. 
He disa2pointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands ca2not perform their enterprise. 
He taketh the wise in their own craftine2s: and the counsel of the froward is ca2ried headlong. 
They m2et with darkne2s in the day time, and grope in the n2onday as in the night. 
But he saveth the p2or from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty. 
So the p2or hath hope, and iniquity sto2peth her mouth. 
Behold, ha2py is the man whom God co2recteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty: 
For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole. 
He sha2l deliver th2e in six troubles: yea, in seven there sha2l no evil touch th2e. 
In famine he sha2l red2em th2e from death: and in war from the power of the sword. 
Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh. 
At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth. 
For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field sha2l be at peace with th2e. 
And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle sha2l be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin. 
Thou shalt know also that thy s2ed sha2l be great, and thine o2fspring as the gra2s of the earth. 
Thou shalt come to thy grave in a fu2l age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season. 
Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy g2od. 
But Job answered and said, 
Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together! 
For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swa2lowed up. 
For the a2rows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the te2rors of God do set themselves in a2ray against me. 
Doth the wild a2s bray when he hath gra2s? or loweth the ox over his fo2der? 
Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an e2g? 
The things that my soul refused to touch are as my so2rowful meat. 
Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for! 
Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let l2ose his hand, and cut me o2f! 
Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in so2row: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. 
What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life? 
Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of bra2s? 
Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me? 
To him that is a2flicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. 
My brethren have dealt deceitfu2ly as a br2ok, and as the stream of br2oks they pa2s away; 
Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid: 
What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. 
The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish. 
The tr2ops of Tema l2oked, the companies of Sheba waited for them. 
They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed. 
For now ye are nothing; ye s2e my casting down, and are afraid. 
Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance? 
Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Red2em me from the hand of the mighty? 
Teach me, and I wi2l hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have e2red. 
How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove? 
Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the sp2eches of one that is desperate, which are as wind? 
Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherle2s, and ye dig a pit for your friend. 
Now therefore be content, l2ok upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie. 
Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousne2s is in it. 
Is there iniquity in my tongue? ca2not my taste discern perverse things? 
Is there not an a2pointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling? 
As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling l2oketh for the reward of his work: 
So am I made to po2se2s months of vanity, and wearisome nights are a2pointed to me. 
When I lie down, I say, When sha2l I arise, and the night be gone? and I am fu2l of to2sings to and fro unto the dawning of the day. 
My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome. 
My days are swifter than a weaver's shu2tle, and are spent without hope. 
O remember that my life is wind: mine eye sha2l no more s2e g2od. 
The eye of him that hath s2en me sha2l s2e me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not. 
As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave sha2l come up no more. 
He sha2l return no more to his house, neither sha2l his place know him any more. 
Therefore I wi2l not refrain my mouth; I wi2l speak in the anguish of my spirit; I wi2l complain in the bi2terne2s of my soul. 
Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou se2test a watch over me? 
When I say, My bed sha2l comfort me, my couch sha2l ease my complaints; 
Then thou scarest me with dreams, and te2rifiest me through visions: 
So that my soul ch2oseth strangling, and death rather than my life. 
I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity. 
What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him? 
And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment? 
How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone ti2l I swa2low down my spi2tle? 
I have si2ned; what sha2l I do unto th2e, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against th2e, so that I am a burden to myself? 
And why dost thou not pardon my transgre2sion, and take away my iniquity? for now sha2l I sl2ep in the dust; and thou shalt s2ek me in the morning, but I sha2l not be. 
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long sha2l the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind? 
Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice? 
If thy children have si2ned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgre2sion; 
If thou wouldest s2ek unto God betimes, and make thy su2plication to the Almighty; 
If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for th2e, and make the habitation of thy righteousne2s prosperous. 
Though thy begi2ning was sma2l, yet thy la2ter end should greatly increase. 
For enquire, I pray th2e, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers: 
(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:) 
Sha2l not they teach th2e, and te2l th2e, and u2ter words out of their heart? 
Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water? 
Whilst it is yet in his gr2e2ne2s, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb. 
So are the paths of a2l that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope sha2l perish: 
Whose hope sha2l be cut o2f, and whose trust sha2l be a spider's web. 
He sha2l lean upon his house, but it sha2l not stand: he sha2l hold it fast, but it sha2l not endure. 
He is gr2en before the sun, and his branch sh2oteth forth in his garden. 
His r2ots are wra2ped about the heap, and s2eth the place of stones. 
If he destroy him from his place, then it sha2l deny him, saying, I have not s2en th2e. 
Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth sha2l others grow. 
Behold, God wi2l not cast away a perfect man, neither wi2l he help the evil doers: 
Ti2l he fi2l thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing. 
They that hate th2e sha2l be clothed with shame; and the dwe2ling place of the wicked sha2l come to nought. 
Then Job answered and said, 
I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God? 
If he wi2l contend with him, he ca2not answer him one of a thousand. 
He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered? 
Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger. 
Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pi2lars thereof tremble. 
Which co2mandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars. 
Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea. 
Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south. 
Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number. 
Lo, he goeth by me, and I s2e him not: he pa2seth on also, but I perceive him not. 
Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who wi2l say unto him, What doest thou? 
If God wi2l not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do st2op under him. 
How much le2s sha2l I answer him, and ch2ose out my words to reason with him? 
Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make su2plication to my judge. 
If I had ca2led, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice. 
For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause. 
He wi2l not su2fer me to take my breath, but fi2leth me with bi2terne2s. 
If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who sha2l set me a time to plead? 
If I justify myself, mine own mouth sha2l condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it sha2l also prove me perverse. 
Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life. 
This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. 
If the scourge slay su2denly, he wi2l laugh at the trial of the i2nocent. 
The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he? 
Now my days are swifter than a post: they fl2e away, they s2e no g2od. 
They are pa2sed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey. 
If I say, I wi2l forget my complaint, I wi2l leave o2f my heavine2s, and comfort myself: 
I am afraid of a2l my so2rows, I know that thou wilt not hold me i2nocent. 
If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain? 
If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean; 
Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes sha2l abhor me. 
For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment. 
Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both. 
Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear te2rify me: 
Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me. 
My soul is weary of my life; I wi2l leave my complaint upon myself; I wi2l speak in the bi2terne2s of my soul. 
I wi2l say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me. 
Is it g2od unto th2e that thou shouldest o2pre2s, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked? 
Hast thou eyes of flesh? or s2est thou as man s2eth? 
Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days, 
That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin? 
Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand. 
Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me. 
Remember, I bes2ech th2e, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again? 
Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like ch2ese? 
Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews. 
Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit. 
And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with th2e. 
If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity. 
If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet wi2l I not lift up my head. I am fu2l of confusion; therefore s2e thou mine a2fliction; 
For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marve2lous upon me. 
Thou renewest thy witne2ses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me. 
Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had s2en me! 
I should have b2en as though I had not b2en; I should have b2en ca2ried from the womb to the grave. 
Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a li2tle, 
Before I go whence I sha2l not return, even to the land of darkne2s and the shadow of death; 
A land of darkne2s, as darkne2s itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkne2s. 
Then answered Zophar the N2amathite, and said, 
Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man fu2l of talk be justified? 
Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, sha2l no man make th2e ashamed? 
For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes. 
But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against th2e; 
And that he would shew th2e the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of th2e le2s than thine iniquity deserveth. 
Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? 
It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? d2eper than he2l; what canst thou know? 
The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. 
If he cut o2f, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him? 
For he knoweth vain men: he s2eth wickedne2s also; wi2l he not then consider it? 
For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild a2s's colt. 
If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him; 
If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedne2s dwe2l in thy tabernacles. 
For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear: 
Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pa2s away: 
And thine age sha2l be clearer than the n2onday: thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning. 
And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about th2e, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety. 
Also thou shalt lie down, and none sha2l make th2e afraid; yea, many sha2l make suit unto th2e. 
But the eyes of the wicked sha2l fail, and they sha2l not escape, and their hope sha2l be as the giving up of the ghost. 
And Job answered and said, 
No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom sha2l die with you. 
But I have understanding as we2l as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these? 
I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who ca2leth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn. 
He that is ready to slip with his f2et is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease. 
The tabernacles of ro2bers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly. 
But ask now the beasts, and they sha2l teach th2e; and the fowls of the air, and they sha2l te2l th2e: 
Or speak to the earth, and it sha2l teach th2e: and the fishes of the sea sha2l declare unto th2e. 
Who knoweth not in a2l these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this? 
In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of a2l mankind. 
Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat? 
With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding. 
With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding. 
Behold, he breaketh down, and it ca2not be built again: he shu2teth up a man, and there can be no opening. 
Behold, he wit2holdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth. 
With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his. 
He leadeth counse2lors away spoiled, and maketh the judges f2ols. 
He l2oseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle. 
He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty. 
He removeth away the sp2ech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged. 
He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty. 
He discovereth d2ep things out of darkne2s, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death. 
He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again. 
He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderne2s where there is no way. 
They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to sta2ger like a drunken man. 
Lo, mine eye hath s2en a2l this, mine ear hath heard and underst2od it. 
What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you. 
Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God. 
But ye are forgers of lies, ye are a2l physicians of no value. 
O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom. 
Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips. 
Wi2l ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfu2ly for him? 
Wi2l ye a2cept his person? wi2l ye contend for God? 
Is it g2od that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him? 
He wi2l surely reprove you, if ye do secretly a2cept persons. 
Sha2l not his exce2lency make you afraid? and his dread fa2l upon you? 
Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay. 
Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what wi2l. 
Wherefore do I take my flesh in my t2eth, and put my life in mine hand? 
Though he slay me, yet wi2l I trust in him: but I wi2l maintain mine own ways before him. 
He also sha2l be my salvation: for an hypocrite sha2l not come before him. 
Hear diligently my sp2ech, and my declaration with your ears. 
Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I sha2l be justified. 
Who is he that wi2l plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I sha2l give up the ghost. 
Only do not two things unto me: then wi2l I not hide myself from th2e. 
Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid. 
Then ca2l thou, and I wi2l answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me. 
How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgre2sion and my sin. 
Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy? 
Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stu2ble? 
For thou writest bi2ter things against me, and makest me to po2se2s the iniquities of my youth. 
Thou pu2test my f2et also in the stocks, and l2okest na2rowly unto a2l my paths; thou se2test a print upon the h2els of my f2et. 
And he, as a ro2ten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten. 
Man that is born of a woman is of few days and fu2l of trouble. 
He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fl2eth also as a shadow, and continueth not. 
And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with th2e? 
Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one. 
S2eing his days are determined, the number of his months are with th2e, thou hast a2pointed his bounds that he ca2not pa2s; 
Turn from him, that he may rest, ti2l he sha2l a2complish, as an hireling, his day. 
For there is hope of a tr2e, if it be cut down, that it wi2l sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof wi2l not cease. 
Though the r2ot thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; 
Yet through the scent of water it wi2l bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant. 
But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? 
As the waters fail from the sea, and the fl2od decayeth and drieth up: 
So man lieth down, and riseth not: ti2l the heavens be no more, they sha2l not awake, nor be raised out of their sl2ep. 
O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest k2ep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest a2point me a set time, and remember me! 
If a man die, sha2l he live again? a2l the days of my a2pointed time wi2l I wait, ti2l my change come. 
Thou shalt ca2l, and I wi2l answer th2e: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands. 
For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin? 
My transgre2sion is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity. 
And surely the mountains fa2ling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place. 
The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man. 
Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he pa2seth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away. 
His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them. 
But his flesh upon him sha2l have pain, and his soul within him sha2l mourn. 
Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 
Should a wise man u2ter vain knowledge, and fi2l his be2ly with the east wind? 
Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with sp2eches wherewith he can do no g2od? 
Yea, thou castest o2f fear, and restrainest prayer before God. 
For thy mouth u2tereth thine iniquity, and thou ch2osest the tongue of the crafty. 
Thine own mouth condemneth th2e, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against th2e. 
Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hi2ls? 
Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself? 
What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us? 
With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father. 
Are the consolations of God sma2l with th2e? is there any secret thing with th2e? 
Why doth thine heart ca2ry th2e away? and what do thy eyes wink at, 
That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and le2test such words go out of thy mouth? 
What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous? 
Behold, he pu2teth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight. 
How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water? 
I wi2l shew th2e, hear me; and that which I have s2en I wi2l declare; 
Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it: 
Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger pa2sed among them. 
The wicked man travaileth with pain a2l his days, and the number of years is hi2den to the o2pre2sor. 
A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer sha2l come upon him. 
He believeth not that he sha2l return out of darkne2s, and he is waited for of the sword. 
He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkne2s is ready at his hand. 
Trouble and anguish sha2l make him afraid; they sha2l prevail against him, as a king ready to the ba2tle. 
For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty. 
He ru2neth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bo2ses of his bucklers: 
Because he covereth his face with his fatne2s, and maketh co2lops of fat on his flanks. 
And he dwe2leth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps. 
He sha2l not be rich, neither sha2l his substance continue, neither sha2l he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth. 
He sha2l not depart out of darkne2s; the flame sha2l dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth sha2l he go away. 
Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity sha2l be his recompence. 
It sha2l be a2complished before his time, and his branch sha2l not be gr2en. 
He sha2l shake o2f his unripe grape as the vine, and sha2l cast o2f his flower as the olive. 
For the congregation of hypocrites sha2l be desolate, and fire sha2l consume the tabernacles of bribery. 
They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their be2ly prepareth deceit. 
Then Job answered and said, 
I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye a2l. 
Sha2l vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth th2e that thou answerest? 
I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you. 
But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should a2swage your grief. 
Though I speak, my grief is not a2swaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased? 
But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate a2l my company. 
And thou hast fi2led me with wrinkles, which is a witne2s against me: and my lea2ne2s rising up in me beareth witne2s to my face. 
He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his t2eth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me. 
They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smi2ten me upon the ch2ek reproachfu2ly; they have gathered themselves together against me. 
God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked. 
I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark. 
His archers compa2s me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my ga2l upon the ground. 
He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he ru2neth upon me like a giant. 
I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust. 
My face is foul with w2eping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death; 
Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure. 
O earth, cover not thou my bl2od, and let my cry have no place. 
Also now, behold, my witne2s is in heaven, and my record is on high. 
My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God. 
O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour! 
When a few years are come, then I sha2l go the way whence I sha2l not return. 
My breath is co2rupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me. 
Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation? 
Lay down now, put me in a surety with th2e; who is he that wi2l strike hands with me? 
For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them. 
He that speaketh fla2tery to his friends, even the eyes of his children sha2l fail. 
He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret. 
Mine eye also is dim by reason of so2row, and a2l my members are as a shadow. 
Upright men sha2l be astonied at this, and the i2nocent sha2l stir up himself against the hypocrite. 
The righteous also sha2l hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands sha2l be stronger and stronger. 
But as for you a2l, do ye return, and come now: for I ca2not find one wise man among you. 
My days are past, my purposes are broken o2f, even the thoughts of my heart. 
They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkne2s. 
If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkne2s. 
I have said to co2ruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister. 
And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who sha2l s2e it? 
They sha2l go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust. 
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
How long wi2l it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we wi2l speak. 
Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight? 
He teareth himself in his anger: sha2l the earth be forsaken for th2e? and sha2l the rock be removed out of his place? 
Yea, the light of the wicked sha2l be put out, and the spark of his fire sha2l not shine. 
The light sha2l be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle sha2l be put out with him. 
The steps of his strength sha2l be straitened, and his own counsel sha2l cast him down. 
For he is cast into a net by his own f2et, and he walketh upon a snare. 
The gin sha2l take him by the h2el, and the ro2ber sha2l prevail against him. 
The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way. 
Te2rors sha2l make him afraid on every side, and sha2l drive him to his f2et. 
His strength sha2l be hungerbi2ten, and destruction sha2l be ready at his side. 
It sha2l devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death sha2l devour his strength. 
His confidence sha2l be r2oted out of his tabernacle, and it sha2l bring him to the king of te2rors. 
It sha2l dwe2l in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone sha2l be sca2tered upon his habitation. 
His r2ots sha2l be dried up beneath, and above sha2l his branch be cut o2f. 
His remembrance sha2l perish from the earth, and he sha2l have no name in the str2et. 
He sha2l be driven from light into darkne2s, and chased out of the world. 
He sha2l neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwe2lings. 
They that come after him sha2l be astonied at his day, as they that went before were a2frighted. 
Surely such are the dwe2lings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God. 
Then Job answered and said, 
How long wi2l ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words? 
These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me. 
And be it ind2ed that I have e2red, mine e2ror remaineth with myself. 
If ind2ed ye wi2l magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach: 
Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compa2sed me with his net. 
Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment. 
He hath fenced up my way that I ca2not pa2s, and he hath set darkne2s in my paths. 
He hath stri2ped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head. 
He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tr2e. 
He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies. 
His tr2ops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle. 
He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me. 
My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgo2ten me. 
They that dwe2l in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight. 
I ca2led my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth. 
My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body. 
Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me. 
A2l my inward friends abho2red me: and they whom I loved are turned against me. 
My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my t2eth. 
Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me. 
Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh? 
Oh that my words were now wri2ten! oh that they were printed in a b2ok! 
That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever! 
For I know that my red2emer liveth, and that he sha2l stand at the la2ter day upon the earth: 
And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh sha2l I s2e God: 
Whom I sha2l s2e for myself, and mine eyes sha2l behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me. 
But ye should say, Why persecute we him, s2eing the r2ot of the ma2ter is found in me? 
Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment. 
Then answered Zophar the N2amathite, and said, 
Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste. 
I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer. 
Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth, 
That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment? 
Though his exce2lency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; 
Yet he sha2l perish for ever like his own dung: they which have s2en him sha2l say, Where is he? 
He sha2l fly away as a dream, and sha2l not be found: yea, he sha2l be chased away as a vision of the night. 
The eye also which saw him sha2l s2e him no more; neither sha2l his place any more behold him. 
His children sha2l s2ek to please the p2or, and his hands sha2l restore their g2ods. 
His bones are fu2l of the sin of his youth, which sha2l lie down with him in the dust. 
Though wickedne2s be sw2et in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue; 
Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but k2ep it sti2l within his mouth: 
Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the ga2l of asps within him. 
He hath swa2lowed down riches, and he sha2l vomit them up again: God sha2l cast them out of his be2ly. 
He sha2l suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue sha2l slay him. 
He sha2l not s2e the rivers, the fl2ods, the br2oks of honey and bu2ter. 
That which he laboured for sha2l he restore, and sha2l not swa2low it down: a2cording to his substance sha2l the restitution be, and he sha2l not rejoice therein. 
Because he hath o2pre2sed and hath forsaken the p2or; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not; 
Surely he sha2l not f2el quietne2s in his be2ly, he sha2l not save of that which he desired. 
There sha2l none of his meat be left; therefore sha2l no man l2ok for his g2ods. 
In the fulne2s of his su2ficiency he sha2l be in straits: every hand of the wicked sha2l come upon him. 
When he is about to fi2l his be2ly, God sha2l cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and sha2l rain it upon him while he is eating. 
He sha2l fl2e from the iron weapon, and the bow of st2el sha2l strike him through. 
It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the gli2tering sword cometh out of his ga2l: te2rors are upon him. 
A2l darkne2s sha2l be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown sha2l consume him; it sha2l go i2l with him that is left in his tabernacle. 
The heaven sha2l reveal his iniquity; and the earth sha2l rise up against him. 
The increase of his house sha2l depart, and his g2ods sha2l flow away in the day of his wrath. 
This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage a2pointed unto him by God. 
But Job answered and said, 
Hear diligently my sp2ech, and let this be your consolations. 
Su2fer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on. 
As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled? 
Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth. 
Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh. 
Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? 
Their s2ed is established in their sight with them, and their o2fspring before their eyes. 
Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them. 
Their bu2l gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. 
They send forth their li2tle ones like a flock, and their children dance. 
They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ. 
They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave. 
Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. 
What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? 
Lo, their g2od is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 
How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth so2rows in his anger. 
They are as stu2ble before the wind, and as cha2f that the storm ca2rieth away. 
God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he sha2l know it. 
His eyes sha2l s2e his destruction, and he sha2l drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 
For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut o2f in the midst? 
Sha2l any teach God knowledge? s2eing he judgeth those that are high. 
One dieth in his fu2l strength, being who2ly at ease and quiet. 
His breasts are fu2l of milk, and his bones are moistened with ma2row. 
And another dieth in the bi2terne2s of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. 
They sha2l lie down alike in the dust, and the worms sha2l cover them. 
Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfu2ly imagine against me. 
For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwe2ling places of the wicked? 
Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens, 
That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they sha2l be brought forth to the day of wrath. 
Who sha2l declare his way to his face? and who sha2l repay him what he hath done? 
Yet sha2l he be brought to the grave, and sha2l remain in the tomb. 
The clods of the va2ley sha2l be sw2et unto him, and every man sha2l draw after him, as there are i2numerable before him. 
How then comfort ye me in vain, s2eing in your answers there remaineth falseh2od? 
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 
Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? 
Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect? 
Wi2l he reprove th2e for fear of th2e? wi2l he enter with th2e into judgment? 
Is not thy wickedne2s great? and thine iniquities infinite? 
For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stri2ped the naked of their clothing. 
Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast wit2holden bread from the hungry. 
But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it. 
Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherle2s have b2en broken. 
Therefore snares are round about th2e, and su2den fear troubleth th2e; 
Or darkne2s, that thou canst not s2e; and abundance of waters cover th2e. 
Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are! 
And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud? 
Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he s2eth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven. 
Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have tro2den? 
Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a fl2od: 
Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them? 
Yet he fi2led their houses with g2od things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 
The righteous s2e it, and are glad: and the i2nocent laugh them to scorn. 
Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth. 
Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby g2od sha2l come unto th2e. 
Receive, I pray th2e, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart. 
If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles. 
Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the br2oks. 
Yea, the Almighty sha2l be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver. 
For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God. 
Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he sha2l hear th2e, and thou shalt pay thy vows. 
Thou shalt also decr2e a thing, and it sha2l be established unto th2e: and the light sha2l shine upon thy ways. 
When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he sha2l save the humble person. 
He sha2l deliver the island of the i2nocent: and it is delivered by the purene2s of thine hands. 
Then Job answered and said, 
Even to day is my complaint bi2ter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning. 
Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat! 
I would order my cause before him, and fi2l my mouth with arguments. 
I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me. 
Wi2l he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me. 
There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge. 
Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I ca2not perceive him: 
On the left hand, where he doth work, but I ca2not behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I ca2not s2e him: 
But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I sha2l come forth as gold. 
My f2ot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined. 
Neither have I gone back from the co2mandment of his lips; I have est2emed the words of his mouth more than my nece2sary f2od. 
But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth. 
For he performeth the thing that is a2pointed for me: and many such things are with him. 
Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him. 
For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me: 
Because I was not cut o2f before the darkne2s, neither hath he covered the darkne2s from my face. 
Why, s2eing times are not hi2den from the Almighty, do they that know him not s2e his days? 
Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and f2ed thereof. 
They drive away the a2s of the fatherle2s, they take the widow's ox for a pledge. 
They turn the n2edy out of the way: the p2or of the earth hide themselves together. 
Behold, as wild a2ses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderne2s yieldeth f2od for them and for their children. 
They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked. 
They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold. 
They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter. 
They pluck the fatherle2s from the breast, and take a pledge of the p2or. 
They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry; 
Which make oil within their wa2ls, and tread their winepre2ses, and su2fer thirst. 
Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not fo2ly to them. 
They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. 
The murderer rising with the light ki2leth the p2or and n2edy, and in the night is as a thief. 
The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye sha2l s2e me: and disguiseth his face. 
In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light. 
For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the te2rors of the shadow of death. 
He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards. 
Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have si2ned. 
The womb sha2l forget him; the worm sha2l f2ed sw2etly on him; he sha2l be no more remembered; and wickedne2s sha2l be broken as a tr2e. 
He evil entreateth the ba2ren that beareth not: and doeth not g2od to the widow. 
He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life. 
Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways. 
They are exalted for a li2tle while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as a2l other, and cut o2f as the tops of the ears of corn. 
And if it be not so now, who wi2l make me a liar, and make my sp2ech nothing worth? 
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places. 
Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise? 
How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? 
Behold even to the m2on, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight. 
How much le2s man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm? 
But Job answered and said, 
How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength? 
How hast thou counse2led him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifu2ly declared the thing as it is? 
To whom hast thou u2tered words? and whose spirit came from th2e? 
Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof. 
He2l is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering. 
He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. 
He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. 
He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it. 
He hath compa2sed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end. 
The pi2lars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his repr2of. 
He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud. 
By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the cr2oked serpent. 
Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how li2tle a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand? 
Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 
As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul; 
A2l the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils; 
My lips sha2l not speak wickedne2s, nor my tongue u2ter deceit. 
God forbid that I should justify you: ti2l I die I wi2l not remove mine integrity from me. 
My righteousne2s I hold fast, and wi2l not let it go: my heart sha2l not reproach me so long as I live. 
Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous. 
For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul? 
Wi2l God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him? 
Wi2l he delight himself in the Almighty? wi2l he always ca2l upon God? 
I wi2l teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty wi2l I not conceal. 
Behold, a2l ye yourselves have s2en it; why then are ye thus altogether vain? 
This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of o2pre2sors, which they sha2l receive of the Almighty. 
If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his o2fspring sha2l not be satisfied with bread. 
Those that remain of him sha2l be buried in death: and his widows sha2l not w2ep. 
Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay; 
He may prepare it, but the just sha2l put it on, and the i2nocent sha2l divide the silver. 
He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a b2oth that the k2eper maketh. 
The rich man sha2l lie down, but he sha2l not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not. 
Te2rors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night. 
The east wind ca2rieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place. 
For God sha2l cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain fl2e out of his hand. 
Men sha2l clap their hands at him, and sha2l hi2s him out of his place. 
Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it. 
Iron is taken out of the earth, and bra2s is molten out of the stone. 
He se2teth an end to darkne2s, and searcheth out a2l perfection: the stones of darkne2s, and the shadow of death. 
The fl2od breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgo2ten of the f2ot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men. 
As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire. 
The stones of it are the place of sa2phires: and it hath dust of gold. 
There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not s2en: 
The lion's whelps have not tro2den it, nor the fierce lion pa2sed by it. 
He pu2teth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the r2ots. 
He cu2teth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye s2eth every precious thing. 
He bindeth the fl2ods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light. 
But where sha2l wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding? 
Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. 
The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me. 
It ca2not be go2ten for gold, neither sha2l silver be weighed for the price thereof. 
It ca2not be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sa2phire. 
The gold and the crystal ca2not equal it: and the exchange of it sha2l not be for jewels of fine gold. 
No mention sha2l be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies. 
The topaz of Ethiopia sha2l not equal it, neither sha2l it be valued with pure gold. 
Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding? 
S2eing it is hid from the eyes of a2l living, and kept close from the fowls of the air. 
Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears. 
God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof. 
For he l2oketh to the ends of the earth, and s2eth under the whole heaven; 
To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure. 
When he made a decr2e for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder: 
Then did he s2e it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out. 
And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding. 
Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 
Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me; 
When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkne2s; 
As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle; 
When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me; 
When I washed my steps with bu2ter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil; 
When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the str2et! 
The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and st2od up. 
The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth. 
The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the r2of of their mouth. 
When the ear heard me, then it ble2sed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witne2s to me: 
Because I delivered the p2or that cried, and the fatherle2s, and him that had none to help him. 
The ble2sing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. 
I put on righteousne2s, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem. 
I was eyes to the blind, and f2et was I to the lame. 
I was a father to the p2or: and the cause which I knew not I searched out. 
And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his t2eth. 
Then I said, I sha2l die in my nest, and I sha2l multiply my days as the sand. 
My r2ot was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay a2l night upon my branch. 
My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand. 
Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel. 
After my words they spake not again; and my sp2ech dro2ped upon them. 
And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the la2ter rain. 
If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down. 
I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners. 
But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock. 
Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished? 
For want and famine they were solitary; fl2eing into the wilderne2s in former time desolate and waste. 
Who cut up ma2lows by the bushes, and juniper r2ots for their meat. 
They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;) 
To dwe2l in the cli2fs of the va2leys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks. 
Among the bushes they brayed; under the ne2tles they were gathered together. 
They were children of f2ols, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth. 
And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword. 
They abhor me, they fl2e far from me, and spare not to spit in my face. 
Because he hath l2osed my cord, and a2flicted me, they have also let l2ose the bridle before me. 
Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my f2et, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction. 
They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper. 
They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they ro2led themselves upon me. 
Te2rors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare pa2seth away as a cloud. 
And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of a2fliction have taken hold upon me. 
My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest. 
By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the co2lar of my coat. 
He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes. 
I cry unto th2e, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not. 
Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou o2posest thyself against me. 
Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and di2solvest my substance. 
For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house a2pointed for a2l living. 
Howbeit he wi2l not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction. 
Did not I w2ep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the p2or? 
When I l2oked for g2od, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkne2s. 
My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of a2fliction prevented me. 
I went mourning without the sun: I st2od up, and I cried in the congregation. 
I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls. 
My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat. 
My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that w2ep. 
I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid? 
For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high? 
Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity? 
Doth not he s2e my ways, and count a2l my steps? 
If I have walked with vanity, or if my f2ot hath hasted to deceit; 
Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity. 
If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands; 
Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my o2fspring be r2oted out. 
If mine heart have b2en deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's d2or; 
Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her. 
For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges. 
For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would r2ot out a2l mine increase. 
If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me; 
What then sha2l I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what sha2l I answer him? 
Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb? 
If I have wit2held the p2or from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; 
Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherle2s hath not eaten thereof; 
(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;) 
If I have s2en any perish for want of clothing, or any p2or without covering; 
If his loins have not ble2sed me, and if he were not warmed with the fl2ece of my sh2ep; 
If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherle2s, when I saw my help in the gate: 
Then let mine arm fa2l from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone. 
For destruction from God was a te2ror to me, and by reason of his highne2s I could not endure. 
If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence; 
If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had go2ten much; 
If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the m2on walking in brightne2s; 
And my heart hath b2en secretly enticed, or my mouth hath ki2sed my hand: 
This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above. 
If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him: 
Neither have I su2fered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul. 
If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we ca2not be satisfied. 
The stranger did not lodge in the str2et: but I opened my d2ors to the trave2ler. 
If I covered my transgre2sions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom: 
Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families te2rify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the d2or? 
Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had wri2ten a b2ok. 
Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me. 
I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him. 
If my land cry against me, or that the fu2rows likewise thereof complain; 
If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life: 
Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended. 
So these thr2e men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 
Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. 
Also against his thr2e friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. 
Now Elihu had waited ti2l Job had spoken, because they were elder than he. 
When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these thr2e men, then his wrath was kindled. 
And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion. 
I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom. 
But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding. 
Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment. 
Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also wi2l shew mine opinion. 
Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say. 
Yea, I a2tended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words: 
Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man. 
Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither wi2l I answer him with your sp2eches. 
They were amazed, they answered no more: they left o2f speaking. 
When I had waited, (for they spake not, but st2od sti2l, and answered no more;) 
I said, I wi2l answer also my part, I also wi2l shew mine opinion. 
For I am fu2l of ma2ter, the spirit within me constraineth me. 
Behold, my be2ly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bo2tles. 
I wi2l speak, that I may be refreshed: I wi2l open my lips and answer. 
Let me not, I pray you, a2cept any man's person, neither let me give fla2tering titles unto man. 
For I know not to give fla2tering titles; in so doing my maker would s2on take me away. 
Wherefore, Job, I pray th2e, hear my sp2eches, and hearken to a2l my words. 
Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth. 
My words sha2l be of the uprightne2s of my heart: and my lips sha2l u2ter knowledge clearly. 
The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life. 
If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up. 
Behold, I am a2cording to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay. 
Behold, my te2ror sha2l not make th2e afraid, neither sha2l my hand be heavy upon th2e. 
Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying, 
I am clean without transgre2sion, I am i2nocent; neither is there iniquity in me. 
Behold, he findeth o2casions against me, he counteth me for his enemy, 
He pu2teth my f2et in the stocks, he marketh a2l my paths. 
Behold, in this thou art not just: I wi2l answer th2e, that God is greater than man. 
Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not a2count of any of his ma2ters. 
For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not. 
In a dream, in a vision of the night, when d2ep sl2ep fa2leth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed; 
Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction, 
That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man. 
He k2epeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword. 
He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain: 
So that his life abho2reth bread, and his soul dainty meat. 
His flesh is consumed away, that it ca2not be s2en; and his bones that were not s2en stick out. 
Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers. 
If there be a me2senger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightne2s: 
Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom. 
His flesh sha2l be fresher than a child's: he sha2l return to the days of his youth: 
He sha2l pray unto God, and he wi2l be favourable unto him: and he sha2l s2e his face with joy: for he wi2l render unto man his righteousne2s. 
He l2oketh upon men, and if any say, I have si2ned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not; 
He wi2l deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life sha2l s2e the light. 
Lo, a2l these things worketh God oftentimes with man, 
To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living. 
Mark we2l, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I wi2l speak. 
If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify th2e. 
If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I sha2l teach th2e wisdom. 
Furthermore Elihu answered and said, 
Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge. 
For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat. 
Let us ch2ose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is g2od. 
For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment. 
Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgre2sion. 
What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water? 
Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men. 
For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God. 
Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedne2s; and from the Almighty, that he should co2mit iniquity. 
For the work of a man sha2l he render unto him, and cause every man to find a2cording to his ways. 
Yea, surely God wi2l not do wickedly, neither wi2l the Almighty pervert judgment. 
Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world? 
If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath; 
A2l flesh sha2l perish together, and man sha2l turn again unto dust. 
If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words. 
Sha2l even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just? 
Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly? 
How much le2s to him that a2cepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the p2or? for they a2l are the work of his hands. 
In a moment sha2l they die, and the people sha2l be troubled at midnight, and pa2s away: and the mighty sha2l be taken away without hand. 
For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he s2eth a2l his goings. 
There is no darkne2s, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. 
For he wi2l not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God. 
He sha2l break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead. 
Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed. 
He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others; 
Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways: 
So that they cause the cry of the p2or to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the a2flicted. 
When he giveth quietne2s, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only: 
That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared. 
Surely it is m2et to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I wi2l not o2fend any more: 
That which I s2e not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I wi2l do no more. 
Should it be a2cording to thy mind? he wi2l recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou ch2ose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest. 
Let men of understanding te2l me, and let a wise man hearken unto me. 
Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom. 
My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men. 
For he a2deth rebe2lion unto his sin, he cla2peth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God. 
Elihu spake moreover, and said, 
Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousne2s is more than God's? 
For thou saidst, What advantage wi2l it be unto th2e? and, What profit sha2l I have, if I be cleansed from my sin? 
I wi2l answer th2e, and thy companions with th2e. 
L2ok unto the heavens, and s2e; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou. 
If thou si2nest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgre2sions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him? 
If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? 
Thy wickedne2s may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousne2s may profit the son of man. 
By reason of the multitude of o2pre2sions they make the o2pre2sed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty. 
But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night; 
Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven? 
There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men. 
Surely God wi2l not hear vanity, neither wi2l the Almighty regard it. 
Although thou sayest thou shalt not s2e him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him. 
But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity: 
Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge. 
Elihu also proc2eded, and said, 
Su2fer me a li2tle, and I wi2l shew th2e that I have yet to speak on God's behalf. 
I wi2l fetch my knowledge from afar, and wi2l ascribe righteousne2s to my Maker. 
For truly my words sha2l not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with th2e. 
Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom. 
He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the p2or. 
He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted. 
And if they be bound in fe2ters, and be holden in cords of a2fliction; 
Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgre2sions that they have exc2eded. 
He openeth also their ear to discipline, and co2mandeth that they return from iniquity. 
If they obey and serve him, they sha2l spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. 
But if they obey not, they sha2l perish by the sword, and they sha2l die without knowledge. 
But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them. 
They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean. 
He delivereth the p2or in his a2fliction, and openeth their ears in o2pre2sion. 
Even so would he have removed th2e out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitne2s; and that which should be set on thy table should be fu2l of fatne2s. 
But thou hast fulfi2led the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on th2e. 
Because there is wrath, beware lest he take th2e away with his stroke: then a great ransom ca2not deliver th2e. 
Wi2l he est2em thy riches? no, not gold, nor a2l the forces of strength. 
Desire not the night, when people are cut o2f in their place. 
Take h2ed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than a2fliction. 
Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him? 
Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity? 
Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold. 
Every man may s2e it; man may behold it afar o2f. 
Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out. 
For he maketh sma2l the drops of water: they pour down rain a2cording to the vapour thereof: 
Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly. 
Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle? 
Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bo2tom of the sea. 
For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance. 
With clouds he covereth the light; and co2mandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt. 
The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the ca2tle also concerning the vapour. 
At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place. 
Hear a2tentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth. 
He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth. 
After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his exce2lency; and he wi2l not stay them when his voice is heard. 
God thundereth marve2lously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we ca2not comprehend. 
For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the sma2l rain, and to the great rain of his strength. 
He sealeth up the hand of every man; that a2l men may know his work. 
Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places. 
Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north. 
By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened. 
Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he sca2tereth his bright cloud: 
And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he co2mandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth. 
He causeth it to come, whether for co2rection, or for his land, or for mercy. 
Hearken unto this, O Job: stand sti2l, and consider the wondrous works of God. 
Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine? 
Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge? 
How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind? 
Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten l2oking gla2s? 
Teach us what we sha2l say unto him; for we ca2not order our sp2ech by reason of darkne2s. 
Sha2l it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he sha2l be swa2lowed up. 
And now men s2e not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind pa2seth, and cleanseth them. 
Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is te2rible majesty. 
Touching the Almighty, we ca2not find him out: he is exce2lent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he wi2l not a2flict. 
Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart. 
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 
Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? 
Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I wi2l demand of th2e, and answer thou me. 
Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. 
Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? 
Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; 
When the morning stars sang together, and a2l the sons of God shouted for joy? 
Or who shut up the sea with d2ors, when it brake forth, as if it had i2sued out of the womb? 
When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkne2s a swa2dlingband for it, 
And brake up for it my decr2ed place, and set bars and d2ors, 
And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here sha2l thy proud waves be stayed? 
Hast thou co2manded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place; 
That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it? 
It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment. 
And from the wicked their light is wit2holden, and the high arm sha2l be broken. 
Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth? 
Have the gates of death b2en opened unto th2e? or hast thou s2en the d2ors of the shadow of death? 
Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it a2l. 
Where is the way where light dwe2leth? and as for darkne2s, where is the place thereof, 
That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof? 
Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great? 
Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou s2en the treasures of the hail, 
Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of ba2tle and war? 
By what way is the light parted, which sca2tereth the east wind upon the earth? 
Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder; 
To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderne2s, wherein there is no man; 
To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth? 
Hath the rain a father? or who hath bego2ten the drops of dew? 
Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it? 
The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the d2ep is frozen. 
Canst thou bind the sw2et influences of Pleiades, or l2ose the bands of Orion? 
Canst thou bring forth Ma2zaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons? 
Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth? 
Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover th2e? 
Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto th2e, Here we are? 
Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart? 
Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bo2tles of heaven, 
When the dust groweth into hardne2s, and the clods cleave fast together? 
Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fi2l the a2petite of the young lions, 
When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait? 
Who provideth for the raven his f2od? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat. 
Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? 
Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? 
They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their so2rows. 
Their young ones are in g2od liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them. 
Who hath sent out the wild a2s fr2e? or who hath l2osed the bands of the wild a2s? 
Whose house I have made the wilderne2s, and the ba2ren land his dwe2lings. 
He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver. 
The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every gr2en thing. 
Wi2l the unicorn be wi2ling to serve th2e, or abide by thy crib? 
Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the fu2row? or wi2l he ha2row the va2leys after th2e? 
Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him? 
Wilt thou believe him, that he wi2l bring home thy s2ed, and gather it into thy barn? 
Gavest thou the g2odly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich? 
Which leaveth her e2gs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust, 
And forge2teth that the f2ot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them. 
She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not her's: her labour is in vain without fear; 
Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding. 
What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider. 
Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder? 
Canst thou make him afraid as a gra2sho2per? the glory of his nostrils is te2rible. 
He paweth in the va2ley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to m2et the armed men. 
He mocketh at fear, and is not a2frighted; neither turneth he back from the sword. 
The quiver ra2tleth against him, the gli2tering spear and the shield. 
He swa2loweth the ground with fiercene2s and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet. 
He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he sme2leth the ba2tle afar o2f, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. 
Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south? 
Doth the eagle mount up at thy co2mand, and make her nest on high? 
She dwe2leth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place. 
From thence she s2eketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar o2f. 
Her young ones also suck up bl2od: and where the slain are, there is she. 
Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said, 
Sha2l he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it. 
Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 
Behold, I am vile; what sha2l I answer th2e? I wi2l lay mine hand upon my mouth. 
Once have I spoken; but I wi2l not answer: yea, twice; but I wi2l proc2ed no further. 
Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 
Gird up thy loins now like a man: I wi2l demand of th2e, and declare thou unto me. 
Wilt thou also disa2nul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? 
Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? 
Deck thyself now with majesty and exce2lency; and a2ray thyself with glory and beauty. 
Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him. 
L2ok on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place. 
Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret. 
Then wi2l I also confe2s unto th2e that thine own right hand can save th2e. 
Behold now behemoth, which I made with th2e; he eateth gra2s as an ox. 
Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his be2ly. 
He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wra2ped together. 
His bones are as strong pieces of bra2s; his bones are like bars of iron. 
He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to a2proach unto him. 
Surely the mountains bring him forth f2od, where a2l the beasts of the field play. 
He lieth under the shady tr2es, in the covert of the r2ed, and fens. 
The shady tr2es cover him with their shadow; the wi2lows of the br2ok compa2s him about. 
Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. 
He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares. 
Canst thou draw out leviathan with an h2ok? or his tongue with a cord which thou le2test down? 
Canst thou put an h2ok into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn? 
Wi2l he make many su2plications unto th2e? wi2l he speak soft words unto th2e? 
Wi2l he make a covenant with th2e? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever? 
Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? 
Sha2l the companions make a banquet of him? sha2l they part him among the merchants? 
Canst thou fi2l his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears? 
Lay thine hand upon him, remember the ba2tle, do no more. 
Behold, the hope of him is in vain: sha2l not one be cast down even at the sight of him? 
None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me? 
Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine. 
I wi2l not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion. 
Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle? 
Who can open the d2ors of his face? his t2eth are te2rible round about. 
His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal. 
One is so near to another, that no air can come betw2en them. 
They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they ca2not be sundered. 
By his n2esings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. 
Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out. 
Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a s2ething pot or caldron. 
His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. 
In his neck remaineth strength, and so2row is turned into joy before him. 
The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they ca2not be moved. 
His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether mi2lstone. 
When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves. 
The sword of him that layeth at him ca2not hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon. 
He est2emeth iron as straw, and bra2s as ro2ten w2od. 
The a2row ca2not make him fl2e: slingstones are turned with him into stu2ble. 
Darts are counted as stu2ble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear. 
Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire. 
He maketh the d2ep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. 
He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the d2ep to be hoary. 
Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear. 
He beholdeth a2l high things: he is a king over a2l the children of pride. 
Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 
I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be wit2holden from th2e. 
Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I u2tered that I underst2od not; things t2o wonderful for me, which I knew not. 
Hear, I bes2ech th2e, and I wi2l speak: I wi2l demand of th2e, and declare thou unto me. 
I have heard of th2e by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye s2eth th2e. 
Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes. 
And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against th2e, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath. 
Therefore take unto you now seven bu2locks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and o2fer up for yourselves a burnt o2fering; and my servant Job sha2l pray for you: for him wi2l I a2cept: lest I deal with you after your fo2ly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job. 
So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the N2amathite went, and did a2cording as the LORD co2manded them: the LORD also a2cepted Job. 
And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before. 
Then came there unto him a2l his brethren, and a2l his sisters, and a2l they that had b2en of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over a2l the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an ea2ring of gold. 
So the LORD ble2sed the la2ter end of Job more than his begi2ning: for he had fourt2en thousand sh2ep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she a2ses. 
He had also seven sons and thr2e daughters. 
And he ca2led the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenha2puch. 
And in a2l the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren. 
After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations. 
So Job died, being old and fu2l of days. 
Ble2sed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of si2ners, nor si2teth in the seat of the scornful. 
But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. 
And he sha2l be like a tr2e planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also sha2l not wither; and whatsoever he doeth sha2l prosper. 
The ungodly are not so: but are like the cha2f which the wind driveth away. 
Therefore the ungodly sha2l not stand in the judgment, nor si2ners in the congregation of the righteous. 
For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly sha2l perish. 
Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? 
The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying, 
Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. 
He that si2teth in the heavens sha2l laugh: the LORD sha2l have them in derision. 
Then sha2l he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. 
Yet have I set my king upon my holy hi2l of Zion. 
I wi2l declare the decr2e: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I bego2ten th2e. 
Ask of me, and I sha2l give th2e the heathen for thine inheritance, and the u2termost parts of the earth for thy po2se2sion. 
Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a po2ter's ve2sel. 
Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. 
Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. 
Ki2s the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a li2tle. Ble2sed are a2l they that put their trust in him. 
Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me. 
Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah. 
But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head. 
I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hi2l. Selah. 
I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me. 
I wi2l not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about. 
Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smi2ten a2l mine enemies upon the ch2ek bone; thou hast broken the t2eth of the ungodly. 
Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy ble2sing is upon thy people. Selah. 
Hear me when I ca2l, O God of my righteousne2s: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distre2s; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. 
O ye sons of men, how long wi2l ye turn my glory into shame? how long wi2l ye love vanity, and s2ek after leasing? Selah. 
But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD wi2l hear when I ca2l unto him. 
Stand in awe, and sin not: co2mune with your own heart upon your bed, and be sti2l. Selah. 
O2fer the sacrifices of righteousne2s, and put your trust in the LORD. 
There be many that say, Who wi2l shew us any g2od? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. 
Thou hast put gladne2s in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased. 
I wi2l both lay me down in peace, and sl2ep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwe2l in safety. 
Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation. 
Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto th2e wi2l I pray. 
My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning wi2l I direct my prayer unto th2e, and wi2l l2ok up. 
For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedne2s: neither sha2l evil dwe2l with th2e. 
The f2olish sha2l not stand in thy sight: thou hatest a2l workers of iniquity. 
Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD wi2l abhor the bl2ody and deceitful man. 
But as for me, I wi2l come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear wi2l I worship toward thy holy temple. 
Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousne2s because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face. 
For there is no faithfulne2s in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedne2s; their throat is an open sepulchre; they fla2ter with their tongue. 
Destroy thou them, O God; let them fa2l by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgre2sions; for they have rebe2led against th2e. 
But let a2l those that put their trust in th2e rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in th2e. 
For thou, LORD, wilt ble2s the righteous; with favour wilt thou compa2s him as with a shield. 
O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 
Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed. 
My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long? 
Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake. 
For in death there is no remembrance of th2e: in the grave who sha2l give th2e thanks? 
I am weary with my groaning; a2l the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. 
Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of a2l mine enemies. 
Depart from me, a2l ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my w2eping. 
The LORD hath heard my su2plication; the LORD wi2l receive my prayer. 
Let a2l mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed su2denly. 
O LORD my God, in th2e do I put my trust: save me from a2l them that persecute me, and deliver me: 
Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. 
O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands; 
If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:) 
Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah. 
Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast co2manded. 
So sha2l the congregation of the people compa2s th2e about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high. 
The LORD sha2l judge the people: judge me, O LORD, a2cording to my righteousne2s, and a2cording to mine integrity that is in me. 
Oh let the wickedne2s of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins. 
My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart. 
God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day. 
If he turn not, he wi2l whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready. 
He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his a2rows against the persecutors. 
Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falseh2od. 
He made a pit, and di2ged it, and is fa2len into the ditch which he made. 
His mischief sha2l return upon his own head, and his violent dealing sha2l come down upon his own pate. 
I wi2l praise the LORD a2cording to his righteousne2s: and wi2l sing praise to the name of the LORD most high. 
O LORD, our Lord, how exce2lent is thy name in a2l the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens. 
Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest sti2l the enemy and the avenger. 
When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the m2on and the stars, which thou hast ordained; 
What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? 
For thou hast made him a li2tle lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. 
Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put a2l things under his f2et: 
A2l sh2ep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field; 
The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever pa2seth through the paths of the seas. 
O LORD our Lord, how exce2lent is thy name in a2l the earth! 
I wi2l praise th2e, O LORD, with my whole heart; I wi2l shew forth a2l thy marve2lous works. 
I wi2l be glad and rejoice in th2e: I wi2l sing praise to thy name, O thou most High. 
When mine enemies are turned back, they sha2l fa2l and perish at thy presence. 
For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right. 
Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever. 
O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them. 
But the LORD sha2l endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment. 
And he sha2l judge the world in righteousne2s, he sha2l minister judgment to the people in uprightne2s. 
The LORD also wi2l be a refuge for the o2pre2sed, a refuge in times of trouble. 
And they that know thy name wi2l put their trust in th2e: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that s2ek th2e. 
Sing praises to the LORD, which dwe2leth in Zion: declare among the people his doings. 
When he maketh inquisition for bl2od, he remembereth them: he forge2teth not the cry of the humble. 
Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I su2fer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death: 
That I may shew forth a2l thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I wi2l rejoice in thy salvation. 
The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own f2ot taken. 
The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Hi2gaion. Selah. 
The wicked sha2l be turned into he2l, and a2l the nations that forget God. 
For the n2edy sha2l not alway be forgo2ten: the expectation of the p2or sha2l not perish for ever. 
Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight. 
Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah. 
Why standest thou afar o2f, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble? 
The wicked in his pride doth persecute the p2or: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined. 
For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and ble2seth the covetous, whom the LORD abho2reth. 
The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, wi2l not s2ek after God: God is not in a2l his thoughts. 
His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for a2l his enemies, he pu2feth at them. 
He hath said in his heart, I sha2l not be moved: for I sha2l never be in adversity. 
His mouth is fu2l of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity. 
He si2teth in the lurking places of the vi2lages: in the secret places doth he murder the i2nocent: his eyes are privily set against the p2or. 
He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the p2or: he doth catch the p2or, when he draweth him into his net. 
He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the p2or may fa2l by his strong ones. 
He hath said in his heart, God hath forgo2ten: he hideth his face; he wi2l never s2e it. 
Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble. 
Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it. 
Thou hast s2en it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the p2or co2mi2teth himself unto th2e; thou art the helper of the fatherle2s. 
Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: s2ek out his wickedne2s ti2l thou find none. 
The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land. 
LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear: 
To judge the fatherle2s and the o2pre2sed, that the man of the earth may no more o2pre2s. 
In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Fl2e as a bird to your mountain? 
For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their a2row upon the string, that they may privily sh2ot at the upright in heart. 
If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do? 
The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. 
The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. 
Upon the wicked he sha2l rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an ho2rible tempest: this sha2l be the portion of their cup. 
For the righteous LORD loveth righteousne2s; his countenance doth behold the upright. 
Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men. 
They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with fla2tering lips and with a double heart do they speak. 
The LORD sha2l cut o2f a2l fla2tering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things: 
Who have said, With our tongue wi2l we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us? 
For the o2pre2sion of the p2or, for the sighing of the n2edy, now wi2l I arise, saith the LORD; I wi2l set him in safety from him that pu2feth at him. 
The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. 
Thou shalt k2ep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. 
The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted. 
How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? 
How long sha2l I take counsel in my soul, having so2row in my heart daily? how long sha2l mine enemy be exalted over me? 
Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sl2ep the sl2ep of death; 
Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved. 
But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart sha2l rejoice in thy salvation. 
I wi2l sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifu2ly with me. 
The f2ol hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are co2rupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth g2od. 
The LORD l2oked down from heaven upon the children of men, to s2e if there were any that did understand, and s2ek God. 
They are a2l gone aside, they are a2l together become filthy: there is none that doeth g2od, no, not one. 
Have a2l the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and ca2l not upon the LORD. 
There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous. 
Ye have shamed the counsel of the p2or, because the LORD is his refuge. 
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob sha2l rejoice, and Israel sha2l be glad. 
Lord, who sha2l abide in thy tabernacle? who sha2l dwe2l in thy holy hi2l? 
He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousne2s, and speaketh the truth in his heart. 
He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour. 
In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. 
He that pu2teth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the i2nocent. He that doeth these things sha2l never be moved. 
Preserve me, O God: for in th2e do I put my trust. 
O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my g2odne2s extendeth not to th2e; 
But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the exce2lent, in whom is a2l my delight. 
Their so2rows sha2l be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink o2ferings of bl2od wi2l I not o2fer, nor take up their names into my lips. 
The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot. 
The lines are fa2len unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a g2odly heritage. 
I wi2l ble2s the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons. 
I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I sha2l not be moved. 
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also sha2l rest in hope. 
For thou wilt not leave my soul in he2l; neither wilt thou su2fer thine Holy One to s2e co2ruption. 
Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulne2s of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore. 
Hear the right, O LORD, a2tend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips. 
Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal. 
Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth sha2l not transgre2s. 
Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer. 
Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my f2otsteps slip not. 
I have ca2led upon th2e, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my sp2ech. 
Shew thy marve2lous lovingkindne2s, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in th2e from those that rise up against them. 
K2ep me as the a2ple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings, 
From the wicked that o2pre2s me, from my deadly enemies, who compa2s me about. 
They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly. 
They have now compa2sed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth; 
Like as a lion that is gr2edy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places. 
Arise, O LORD, disa2point him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword: 
From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose be2ly thou fi2lest with thy hid treasure: they are fu2l of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes. 
As for me, I wi2l behold thy face in righteousne2s: I sha2l be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likene2s. 
I wi2l love th2e, O LORD, my strength. 
The LORD is my rock, and my fortre2s, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I wi2l trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. 
I wi2l ca2l upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so sha2l I be saved from mine enemies. 
The so2rows of death compa2sed me, and the fl2ods of ungodly men made me afraid. 
The so2rows of he2l compa2sed me about: the snares of death prevented me. 
In my distre2s I ca2led upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears. 
Then the earth sh2ok and trembled; the foundations also of the hi2ls moved and were shaken, because he was wroth. 
There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. 
He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkne2s was under his f2et. 
And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind. 
He made darkne2s his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies. 
At the brightne2s that was before him his thick clouds pa2sed, hail stones and coals of fire. 
The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire. 
Yea, he sent out his a2rows, and sca2tered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them. 
Then the cha2nels of waters were s2en, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils. 
He sent from above, he t2ok me, he drew me out of many waters. 
He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were t2o strong for me. 
They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay. 
He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me. 
The LORD rewarded me a2cording to my righteousne2s; a2cording to the clea2ne2s of my hands hath he recompensed me. 
For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God. 
For a2l his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me. 
I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity. 
Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me a2cording to my righteousne2s, a2cording to the clea2ne2s of my hands in his eyesight. 
With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright; 
With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward. 
For thou wilt save the a2flicted people; but wilt bring down high l2oks. 
For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God wi2l enlighten my darkne2s. 
For by th2e I have run through a tr2op; and by my God have I leaped over a wa2l. 
As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to a2l those that trust in him. 
For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God? 
It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect. 
He maketh my f2et like hinds' f2et, and se2teth me upon my high places. 
He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of st2el is broken by mine arms. 
Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentlene2s hath made me great. 
Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my f2et did not slip. 
I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again ti2l they were consumed. 
I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fa2len under my f2et. 
For thou hast girded me with strength unto the ba2tle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. 
Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me. 
They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not. 
Then did I beat them sma2l as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the str2ets. 
Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known sha2l serve me. 
As s2on as they hear of me, they sha2l obey me: the strangers sha2l submit themselves unto me. 
The strangers sha2l fade away, and be afraid out of their close places. 
The LORD liveth; and ble2sed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted. 
It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me. 
He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man. 
Therefore wi2l I give thanks unto th2e, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name. 
Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his s2ed for evermore. 
The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. 
Day unto day u2tereth sp2ech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. 
There is no sp2ech nor language, where their voice is not heard. 
Their line is gone out through a2l the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, 
Which is as a bridegr2om coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race. 
His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. 
The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple. 
The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the co2mandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes. 
The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether. 
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sw2eter also than honey and the honeycomb. 
Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in k2eping of them there is great reward. 
Who can understand his e2rors? cleanse thou me from secret faults. 
K2ep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then sha2l I be upright, and I sha2l be i2nocent from the great transgre2sion. 
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be a2ceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my red2emer. 
The LORD hear th2e in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend th2e; 
Send th2e help from the sanctuary, and strengthen th2e out of Zion; 
Remember a2l thy o2ferings, and a2cept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah. 
Grant th2e a2cording to thine own heart, and fulfil a2l thy counsel. 
We wi2l rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we wi2l set up our ba2ners: the LORD fulfil a2l thy petitions. 
Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he wi2l hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand. 
Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we wi2l remember the name of the LORD our God. 
They are brought down and fa2len: but we are risen, and stand upright. 
Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we ca2l. 
The king sha2l joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly sha2l he rejoice! 
Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not wit2holden the request of his lips. Selah. 
For thou preventest him with the ble2sings of g2odne2s: thou se2test a crown of pure gold on his head. 
He asked life of th2e, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever. 
His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him. 
For thou hast made him most ble2sed for ever: thou hast made him exc2eding glad with thy countenance. 
For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he sha2l not be moved. 
Thine hand sha2l find out a2l thine enemies: thy right hand sha2l find out those that hate th2e. 
Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD sha2l swa2low them up in his wrath, and the fire sha2l devour them. 
Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their s2ed from among the children of men. 
For they intended evil against th2e: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform. 
Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine a2rows upon thy strings against the face of them. 
Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so wi2l we sing and praise thy power. 
My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring? 
O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent. 
But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel. 
Our fathers trusted in th2e: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them. 
They cried unto th2e, and were delivered: they trusted in th2e, and were not confounded. 
But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people. 
A2l they that s2e me laugh me to scorn: they sh2ot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, 
He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, s2eing he delighted in him. 
But thou art he that t2ok me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts. 
I was cast upon th2e from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's be2ly. 
Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help. 
Many bu2ls have compa2sed me: strong bu2ls of Bashan have beset me round. 
They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion. 
I am poured out like water, and a2l my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels. 
My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death. 
For dogs have compa2sed me: the a2sembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my f2et. 
I may te2l a2l my bones: they l2ok and stare upon me. 
They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture. 
But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste th2e to help me. 
Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog. 
Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns. 
I wi2l declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation wi2l I praise th2e. 
Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; a2l ye the s2ed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, a2l ye the s2ed of Israel. 
For he hath not despised nor abho2red the a2fliction of the a2flicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard. 
My praise sha2l be of th2e in the great congregation: I wi2l pay my vows before them that fear him. 
The m2ek sha2l eat and be satisfied: they sha2l praise the LORD that s2ek him: your heart sha2l live for ever. 
A2l the ends of the world sha2l remember and turn unto the LORD: and a2l the kindreds of the nations sha2l worship before th2e. 
For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among the nations. 
A2l they that be fat upon earth sha2l eat and worship: a2l they that go down to the dust sha2l bow before him: and none can k2ep alive his own soul. 
A s2ed sha2l serve him; it sha2l be a2counted to the Lord for a generation. 
They sha2l come, and sha2l declare his righteousne2s unto a people that sha2l be born, that he hath done this. 
The LORD is my shepherd; I sha2l not want. 
He maketh me to lie down in gr2en pastures: he leadeth me beside the sti2l waters. 
He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousne2s for his name's sake. 
Yea, though I walk through the va2ley of the shadow of death, I wi2l fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy sta2f they comfort me. 
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup ru2neth over. 
Surely g2odne2s and mercy sha2l fo2low me a2l the days of my life: and I wi2l dwe2l in the house of the LORD for ever. 
The earth is the LORD's, and the fulne2s thereof; the world, and they that dwe2l therein. 
For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the fl2ods. 
Who sha2l ascend into the hi2l of the LORD? or who sha2l stand in his holy place? 
He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfu2ly. 
He sha2l receive the ble2sing from the LORD, and righteousne2s from the God of his salvation. 
This is the generation of them that s2ek him, that s2ek thy face, O Jacob. Selah. 
Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting d2ors; and the King of glory sha2l come in. 
Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in ba2tle. 
Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting d2ors; and the King of glory sha2l come in. 
Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah. 
Unto th2e, O LORD, do I lift up my soul. 
O my God, I trust in th2e: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me. 
Yea, let none that wait on th2e be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgre2s without cause. 
Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths. 
Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on th2e do I wait a2l the day. 
Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindne2ses; for they have b2en ever of old. 
Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgre2sions: a2cording to thy mercy remember thou me for thy g2odne2s' sake, O LORD. 
G2od and upright is the LORD: therefore wi2l he teach si2ners in the way. 
The m2ek wi2l he guide in judgment: and the m2ek wi2l he teach his way. 
A2l the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as k2ep his covenant and his testimonies. 
For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great. 
What man is he that feareth the LORD? him sha2l he teach in the way that he sha2l ch2ose. 
His soul sha2l dwe2l at ease; and his s2ed sha2l inherit the earth. 
The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he wi2l shew them his covenant. 
Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he sha2l pluck my f2et out of the net. 
Turn th2e unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and a2flicted. 
The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distre2ses. 
L2ok upon mine a2fliction and my pain; and forgive a2l my sins. 
Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred. 
O k2ep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in th2e. 
Let integrity and uprightne2s preserve me; for I wait on th2e. 
Red2em Israel, O God, out of a2l his troubles. 
Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I sha2l not slide. 
Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart. 
For thy lovingkindne2s is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth. 
I have not sat with vain persons, neither wi2l I go in with di2semblers. 
I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and wi2l not sit with the wicked. 
I wi2l wash mine hands in i2nocency: so wi2l I compa2s thine altar, O LORD: 
That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and te2l of a2l thy wondrous works. 
LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwe2leth. 
Gather not my soul with si2ners, nor my life with bl2ody men: 
In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is fu2l of bribes. 
But as for me, I wi2l walk in mine integrity: red2em me, and be merciful unto me. 
My f2ot standeth in an even place: in the congregations wi2l I ble2s the LORD. 
The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom sha2l I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom sha2l I be afraid? 
When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fe2l. 
Though an host should encamp against me, my heart sha2l not fear: though war should rise against me, in this wi2l I be confident. 
One thing have I desired of the LORD, that wi2l I s2ek after; that I may dwe2l in the house of the LORD a2l the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple. 
For in the time of trouble he sha2l hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle sha2l he hide me; he sha2l set me up upon a rock. 
And now sha2l mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore wi2l I o2fer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I wi2l sing, yea, I wi2l sing praises unto the LORD. 
Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me. 
When thou saidst, S2ek ye my face; my heart said unto th2e, Thy face, LORD, wi2l I s2ek. 
Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast b2en my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. 
When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD wi2l take me up. 
Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies. 
Deliver me not over unto the wi2l of mine enemies: for false witne2ses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty. 
I had fainted, unle2s I had believed to s2e the g2odne2s of the LORD in the land of the living. 
Wait on the LORD: be of g2od courage, and he sha2l strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD. 
Unto th2e wi2l I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit. 
Hear the voice of my su2plications, when I cry unto th2e, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle. 
Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts. 
Give them a2cording to their d2eds, and a2cording to the wickedne2s of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert. 
Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he sha2l destroy them, and not build them up. 
Ble2sed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my su2plications. 
The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song wi2l I praise him. 
The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed. 
Save thy people, and ble2s thine inheritance: f2ed them also, and lift them up for ever. 
Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and strength. 
Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holine2s. 
The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters. 
The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is fu2l of majesty. 
The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon. 
He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn. 
The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire. 
The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderne2s; the LORD shaketh the wilderne2s of Kadesh. 
The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory. 
The LORD si2teth upon the fl2od; yea, the LORD si2teth King for ever. 
The LORD wi2l give strength unto his people; the LORD wi2l ble2s his people with peace. 
I wi2l extol th2e, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me. 
O LORD my God, I cried unto th2e, and thou hast healed me. 
O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. 
Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holine2s. 
For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: w2eping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. 
And in my prosperity I said, I sha2l never be moved. 
LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled. 
I cried to th2e, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made su2plication. 
What profit is there in my bl2od, when I go down to the pit? Sha2l the dust praise th2e? sha2l it declare thy truth? 
Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper. 
Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put o2f my sackcloth, and girded me with gladne2s; 
To the end that my glory may sing praise to th2e, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I wi2l give thanks unto th2e for ever. 
In th2e, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousne2s. 
Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me sp2edily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me. 
For thou art my rock and my fortre2s; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me. 
Pu2l me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength. 
Into thine hand I co2mit my spirit: thou hast red2emed me, O LORD God of truth. 
I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD. 
I wi2l be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities; 
And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my f2et in a large r2om. 
Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my be2ly. 
For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed. 
I was a reproach among a2l mine enemies, but especia2ly among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did s2e me without fled from me. 
I am forgo2ten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken ve2sel. 
For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they t2ok counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life. 
But I trusted in th2e, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God. 
My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me. 
Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake. 
Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have ca2led upon th2e: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave. 
Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous. 
Oh how great is thy g2odne2s, which thou hast laid up for them that fear th2e; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in th2e before the sons of men! 
Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt k2ep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues. 
Ble2sed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marve2lous kindne2s in a strong city. 
For I said in my haste, I am cut o2f from before thine eyes: neverthele2s thou heardest the voice of my su2plications when I cried unto th2e. 
O love the LORD, a2l ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifu2ly rewardeth the proud doer. 
Be of g2od courage, and he sha2l strengthen your heart, a2l ye that hope in the LORD. 
Ble2sed is he whose transgre2sion is forgiven, whose sin is covered. 
Ble2sed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile. 
When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring a2l the day long. 
For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of su2mer. Selah. 
I acknowledge my sin unto th2e, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I wi2l confe2s my transgre2sions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah. 
For this sha2l every one that is godly pray unto th2e in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the fl2ods of great waters they sha2l not come nigh unto him. 
Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compa2s me about with songs of deliverance. Selah. 
I wi2l instruct th2e and teach th2e in the way which thou shalt go: I wi2l guide th2e with mine eye. 
Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto th2e. 
Many so2rows sha2l be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy sha2l compa2s him about. 
Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, a2l ye that are upright in heart. 
Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright. 
Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings. 
Sing unto him a new song; play skilfu2ly with a loud noise. 
For the word of the LORD is right; and a2l his works are done in truth. 
He loveth righteousne2s and judgment: the earth is fu2l of the g2odne2s of the LORD. 
By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and a2l the host of them by the breath of his mouth. 
He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses. 
Let a2l the earth fear the LORD: let a2l the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. 
For he spake, and it was done; he co2manded, and it st2od fast. 
The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none e2fect. 
The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to a2l generations. 
Ble2sed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance. 
The LORD l2oketh from heaven; he beholdeth a2l the sons of men. 
From the place of his habitation he l2oketh upon a2l the inhabitants of the earth. 
He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth a2l their works. 
There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength. 
An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither sha2l he deliver any by his great strength. 
Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy; 
To deliver their soul from death, and to k2ep them alive in famine. 
Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield. 
For our heart sha2l rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. 
Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, a2cording as we hope in th2e. 
I wi2l ble2s the LORD at a2l times: his praise sha2l continua2ly be in my mouth. 
My soul sha2l make her boast in the LORD: the humble sha2l hear thereof, and be glad. 
O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together. 
I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from a2l my fears. 
They l2oked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed. 
This p2or man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of a2l his troubles. 
The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them. 
O taste and s2e that the LORD is g2od: ble2sed is the man that trusteth in him. 
O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him. 
The young lions do lack, and su2fer hunger: but they that s2ek the LORD sha2l not want any g2od thing. 
Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I wi2l teach you the fear of the LORD. 
What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may s2e g2od? 
K2ep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. 
Depart from evil, and do g2od; s2ek peace, and pursue it. 
The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry. 
The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut o2f the remembrance of them from the earth. 
The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of a2l their troubles. 
The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit. 
Many are the a2flictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them a2l. 
He k2epeth a2l his bones: not one of them is broken. 
Evil sha2l slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous sha2l be desolate. 
The LORD red2emeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him sha2l be desolate. 
Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me. 
Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help. 
Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation. 
Let them be confounded and put to shame that s2ek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt. 
Let them be as cha2f before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase them. 
Let their way be dark and sli2pery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them. 
For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they have di2ged for my soul. 
Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fa2l. 
And my soul sha2l be joyful in the LORD: it sha2l rejoice in his salvation. 
A2l my bones sha2l say, LORD, who is like unto th2e, which deliverest the p2or from him that is t2o strong for him, yea, the p2or and the n2edy from him that spoileth him? 
False witne2ses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not. 
They rewarded me evil for g2od to the spoiling of my soul. 
But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom. 
I behaved myself as though he had b2en my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother. 
But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not: 
With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their t2eth. 
Lord, how long wilt thou l2ok on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions. 
I wi2l give th2e thanks in the great congregation: I wi2l praise th2e among much people. 
Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfu2ly rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause. 
For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful ma2ters against them that are quiet in the land. 
Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath s2en it. 
This thou hast s2en, O LORD: k2ep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me. 
Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord. 
Judge me, O LORD my God, a2cording to thy righteousne2s; and let them not rejoice over me. 
Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swa2lowed him up. 
Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me. 
Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continua2ly, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant. 
And my tongue sha2l speak of thy righteousne2s and of thy praise a2l the day long. 
The transgre2sion of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes. 
For he fla2tereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful. 
The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left o2f to be wise, and to do g2od. 
He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he se2teth himself in a way that is not g2od; he abho2reth not evil. 
Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulne2s reacheth unto the clouds. 
Thy righteousne2s is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great d2ep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast. 
How exce2lent is thy lovingkindne2s, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings. 
They sha2l be abundantly satisfied with the fatne2s of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures. 
For with th2e is the fountain of life: in thy light sha2l we s2e light. 
O continue thy lovingkindne2s unto them that know th2e; and thy righteousne2s to the upright in heart. 
Let not the f2ot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me. 
There are the workers of iniquity fa2len: they are cast down, and sha2l not be able to rise. 
Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. 
For they sha2l s2on be cut down like the gra2s, and wither as the gr2en herb. 
Trust in the LORD, and do g2od; so shalt thou dwe2l in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed. 
Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he sha2l give th2e the desires of thine heart. 
Co2mit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he sha2l bring it to pa2s. 
And he sha2l bring forth thy righteousne2s as the light, and thy judgment as the n2onday. 
Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pa2s. 
Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil. 
For evildoers sha2l be cut o2f: but those that wait upon the LORD, they sha2l inherit the earth. 
For yet a li2tle while, and the wicked sha2l not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it sha2l not be. 
But the m2ek sha2l inherit the earth; and sha2l delight themselves in the abundance of peace. 
The wicked plo2teth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his t2eth. 
The LORD sha2l laugh at him: for he s2eth that his day is coming. 
The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the p2or and n2edy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation. 
Their sword sha2l enter into their own heart, and their bows sha2l be broken. 
A li2tle that a righteous man hath is be2ter than the riches of many wicked. 
For the arms of the wicked sha2l be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous. 
The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance sha2l be for ever. 
They sha2l not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they sha2l be satisfied. 
But the wicked sha2l perish, and the enemies of the LORD sha2l be as the fat of lambs: they sha2l consume; into smoke sha2l they consume away. 
The wicked bo2roweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth. 
For such as be ble2sed of him sha2l inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him sha2l be cut o2f. 
The steps of a g2od man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way. 
Though he fa2l, he sha2l not be u2terly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand. 
I have b2en young, and now am old; yet have I not s2en the righteous forsaken, nor his s2ed be2ging bread. 
He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his s2ed is ble2sed. 
Depart from evil, and do g2od; and dwe2l for evermore. 
For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the s2ed of the wicked sha2l be cut o2f. 
The righteous sha2l inherit the land, and dwe2l therein for ever. 
The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment. 
The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps sha2l slide. 
The wicked watcheth the righteous, and s2eketh to slay him. 
The LORD wi2l not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged. 
Wait on the LORD, and k2ep his way, and he sha2l exalt th2e to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut o2f, thou shalt s2e it. 
I have s2en the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a gr2en bay tr2e. 
Yet he pa2sed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found. 
Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace. 
But the transgre2sors sha2l be destroyed together: the end of the wicked sha2l be cut o2f. 
But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble. 
And the LORD sha2l help them, and deliver them: he sha2l deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him. 
O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 
For thine a2rows stick fast in me, and thy hand pre2seth me sore. 
There is no soundne2s in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin. 
For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are t2o heavy for me. 
My wounds stink and are co2rupt because of my f2olishne2s. 
I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning a2l the day long. 
For my loins are fi2led with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundne2s in my flesh. 
I am f2eble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietne2s of my heart. 
Lord, a2l my desire is before th2e; and my groaning is not hid from th2e. 
My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. 
My lovers and my friends stand al2of from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar o2f. 
They also that s2ek after my life lay snares for me: and they that s2ek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits a2l the day long. 
But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. 
Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no repr2ofs. 
For in th2e, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God. 
For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my f2ot sli2peth, they magnify themselves against me. 
For I am ready to halt, and my so2row is continua2ly before me. 
For I wi2l declare mine iniquity; I wi2l be so2ry for my sin. 
But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfu2ly are multiplied. 
They also that render evil for g2od are mine adversaries; because I fo2low the thing that g2od is. 
Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me. 
Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation. 
I said, I wi2l take h2ed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I wi2l k2ep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me. 
I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from g2od; and my so2row was sti2red. 
My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue, 
LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is: that I may know how frail I am. 
Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before th2e: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah. 
Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who sha2l gather them. 
And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in th2e. 
Deliver me from a2l my transgre2sions: make me not the reproach of the f2olish. 
I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it. 
Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand. 
When thou with rebukes dost co2rect man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah. 
Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with th2e, and a sojourner, as a2l my fathers were. 
O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more. 
I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. 
He brought me up also out of an ho2rible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my f2et upon a rock, and established my goings. 
And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many sha2l s2e it, and fear, and sha2l trust in the LORD. 
Ble2sed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies. 
Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they ca2not be reckoned up in order unto th2e: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered. 
Sacrifice and o2fering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt o2fering and sin o2fering hast thou not required. 
Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the b2ok it is wri2ten of me, 
I delight to do thy wi2l, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart. 
I have preached righteousne2s in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest. 
I have not hid thy righteousne2s within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulne2s and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindne2s and thy truth from the great congregation. 
Wit2hold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindne2s and thy truth continua2ly preserve me. 
For i2numerable evils have compa2sed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to l2ok up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me. 
Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me. 
Let them be ashamed and confounded together that s2ek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil. 
Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha. 
Let a2l those that s2ek th2e rejoice and be glad in th2e: let such as love thy salvation say continua2ly, The LORD be magnified. 
But I am p2or and n2edy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; make no ta2rying, O my God. 
Ble2sed is he that considereth the p2or: the LORD wi2l deliver him in time of trouble. 
The LORD wi2l preserve him, and k2ep him alive; and he sha2l be ble2sed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the wi2l of his enemies. 
The LORD wi2l strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make a2l his bed in his sickne2s. 
I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have si2ned against th2e. 
Mine enemies speak evil of me, When sha2l he die, and his name perish? 
And if he come to s2e me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he te2leth it. 
A2l that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt. 
An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that he lieth he sha2l rise up no more. 
Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his h2el against me. 
But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them. 
By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me. 
And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and se2test me before thy face for ever. 
Ble2sed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen. 
As the hart panteth after the water br2oks, so panteth my soul after th2e, O God. 
My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when sha2l I come and a2pear before God? 
My tears have b2en my meat day and night, while they continua2ly say unto me, Where is thy God? 
When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday. 
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I sha2l yet praise him for the help of his countenance. 
O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore wi2l I remember th2e from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hi2l Mizar. 
D2ep ca2leth unto d2ep at the noise of thy waterspouts: a2l thy waves and thy bi2lows are gone over me. 
Yet the LORD wi2l co2mand his lovingkindne2s in the day time, and in the night his song sha2l be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life. 
I wi2l say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgo2ten me? why go I mourning because of the o2pre2sion of the enemy? 
As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God? 
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I sha2l yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God. 
Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man. 
For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me o2f? why go I mourning because of the o2pre2sion of the enemy? 
O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hi2l, and to thy tabernacles. 
Then wi2l I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exc2eding joy: yea, upon the harp wi2l I praise th2e, O God my God. 
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I sha2l yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God. 
We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old. 
How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst a2flict the people, and cast them out. 
For they got not the land in po2se2sion by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them. 
Thou art my King, O God: co2mand deliverances for Jacob. 
Through th2e wi2l we push down our enemies: through thy name wi2l we tread them under that rise up against us. 
For I wi2l not trust in my bow, neither sha2l my sword save me. 
But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us. 
In God we boast a2l the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah. 
But thou hast cast o2f, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies. 
Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves. 
Thou hast given us like sh2ep a2pointed for meat; and hast sca2tered us among the heathen. 
Thou se2lest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price. 
Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us. 
Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people. 
My confusion is continua2ly before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me, 
For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger. 
A2l this is come upon us; yet have we not forgo2ten th2e, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant. 
Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way; 
Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death. 
If we have forgo2ten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god; 
Sha2l not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. 
Yea, for thy sake are we ki2led a2l the day long; we are counted as sh2ep for the slaughter. 
Awake, why sl2epest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not o2f for ever. 
Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forge2test our a2fliction and our o2pre2sion? 
For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our be2ly cleaveth unto the earth. 
Arise for our help, and red2em us for thy mercies' sake. 
My heart is inditing a g2od ma2ter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer. 
Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath ble2sed th2e for ever. 
Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. 
And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and m2ekne2s and righteousne2s; and thy right hand sha2l teach th2e te2rible things. 
Thine a2rows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fa2l under th2e. 
Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre. 
Thou lovest righteousne2s, and hatest wickedne2s: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed th2e with the oil of gladne2s above thy fe2lows. 
A2l thy garments sme2l of my2rh, and aloes, and ca2sia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made th2e glad. 
Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the qu2en in gold of Ophir. 
Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house; 
So sha2l the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him. 
And the daughter of Tyre sha2l be there with a gift; even the rich among the people sha2l intreat thy favour. 
The king's daughter is a2l glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold. 
She sha2l be brought unto the king in raiment of n2edlework: the virgins her companions that fo2low her sha2l be brought unto th2e. 
With gladne2s and rejoicing sha2l they be brought: they sha2l enter into the king's palace. 
Instead of thy fathers sha2l be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in a2l the earth. 
I wi2l make thy name to be remembered in a2l generations: therefore sha2l the people praise th2e for ever and ever. 
God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. 
Therefore wi2l not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be ca2ried into the midst of the sea; 
Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swe2ling thereof. Selah. 
There is a river, the streams whereof sha2l make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High. 
God is in the midst of her; she sha2l not be moved: God sha2l help her, and that right early. 
The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he u2tered his voice, the earth melted. 
The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah. 
Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth. 
He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cu2teth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire. 
Be sti2l, and know that I am God: I wi2l be exalted among the heathen, I wi2l be exalted in the earth. 
The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah. 
O clap your hands, a2l ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph. 
For the LORD most high is te2rible; he is a great King over a2l the earth. 
He sha2l subdue the people under us, and the nations under our f2et. 
He sha2l ch2ose our inheritance for us, the exce2lency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah. 
God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet. 
Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises. 
For God is the King of a2l the earth: sing ye praises with understanding. 
God reigneth over the heathen: God si2teth upon the throne of his holine2s. 
The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted. 
Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holine2s. 
Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King. 
God is known in her palaces for a refuge. 
For, lo, the kings were a2sembled, they pa2sed by together. 
They saw it, and so they marve2led; they were troubled, and hasted away. 
Fear t2ok hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail. 
Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind. 
As we have heard, so have we s2en in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God wi2l establish it for ever. Selah. 
We have thought of thy lovingkindne2s, O God, in the midst of thy temple. 
A2cording to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is fu2l of righteousne2s. 
Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments. 
Walk about Zion, and go round about her: te2l the towers thereof. 
Mark ye we2l her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may te2l it to the generation fo2lowing. 
For this God is our God for ever and ever: he wi2l be our guide even unto death. 
Hear this, a2l ye people; give ear, a2l ye inhabitants of the world: 
Both low and high, rich and p2or, together. 
My mouth sha2l speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart sha2l be of understanding. 
I wi2l incline mine ear to a parable: I wi2l open my dark saying upon the harp. 
Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my h2els sha2l compa2s me about? 
They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; 
None of them can by any means red2em his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him: 
(For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:) 
That he should sti2l live for ever, and not s2e co2ruption. 
For he s2eth that wise men die, likewise the f2ol and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others. 
Their inward thought is, that their houses sha2l continue for ever, and their dwe2ling places to a2l generations; they ca2l their lands after their own names. 
Neverthele2s man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish. 
This their way is their fo2ly: yet their posterity a2prove their sayings. Selah. 
Like sh2ep they are laid in the grave; death sha2l f2ed on them; and the upright sha2l have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty sha2l consume in the grave from their dwe2ling. 
But God wi2l red2em my soul from the power of the grave: for he sha2l receive me. Selah. 
Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased; 
For when he dieth he sha2l ca2ry nothing away: his glory sha2l not descend after him. 
Though while he lived he ble2sed his soul: and men wi2l praise th2e, when thou doest we2l to thyself. 
He sha2l go to the generation of his fathers; they sha2l never s2e light. 
Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish. 
The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and ca2led the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof. 
Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined. 
Our God sha2l come, and sha2l not k2ep silence: a fire sha2l devour before him, and it sha2l be very tempestuous round about him. 
He sha2l ca2l to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people. 
Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice. 
And the heavens sha2l declare his righteousne2s: for God is judge himself. Selah. 
Hear, O my people, and I wi2l speak; O Israel, and I wi2l testify against th2e: I am God, even thy God. 
I wi2l not reprove th2e for thy sacrifices or thy burnt o2ferings, to have b2en continua2ly before me. 
I wi2l take no bu2lock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds. 
For every beast of the forest is mine, and the ca2tle upon a thousand hi2ls. 
I know a2l the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine. 
If I were hungry, I would not te2l th2e: for the world is mine, and the fulne2s thereof. 
Wi2l I eat the flesh of bu2ls, or drink the bl2od of goats? 
O2fer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High: 
And ca2l upon me in the day of trouble: I wi2l deliver th2e, and thou shalt glorify me. 
But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth? 
S2eing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind th2e. 
When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast b2en partaker with adulterers. 
Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit. 
Thou si2test and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son. 
These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I wi2l reprove th2e, and set them in order before thine eyes. 
Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver. 
Whoso o2fereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright wi2l I shew the salvation of God. 
Have mercy upon me, O God, a2cording to thy lovingkindne2s: a2cording unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgre2sions. 
Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 
For I acknowledge my transgre2sions: and my sin is ever before me. 
Against th2e, th2e only, have I si2ned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. 
Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me. 
Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hi2den part thou shalt make me to know wisdom. 
Purge me with hy2sop, and I sha2l be clean: wash me, and I sha2l be whiter than snow. 
Make me to hear joy and gladne2s; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. 
Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out a2l mine iniquities. 
Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. 
Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me. 
Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy fr2e spirit. 
Then wi2l I teach transgre2sors thy ways; and si2ners sha2l be converted unto th2e. 
Deliver me from bl2odguiltine2s, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue sha2l sing aloud of thy righteousne2s. 
O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth sha2l shew forth thy praise. 
For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt o2fering. 
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. 
Do g2od in thy g2od pleasure unto Zion: build thou the wa2ls of Jerusalem. 
Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousne2s, with burnt o2fering and whole burnt o2fering: then sha2l they o2fer bu2locks upon thine altar. 
Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the g2odne2s of God endureth continua2ly. 
The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfu2ly. 
Thou lovest evil more than g2od; and lying rather than to speak righteousne2s. Selah. 
Thou lovest a2l devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue. 
God sha2l likewise destroy th2e for ever, he sha2l take th2e away, and pluck th2e out of thy dwe2ling place, and r2ot th2e out of the land of the living. Selah. 
The righteous also sha2l s2e, and fear, and sha2l laugh at him: 
Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedne2s. 
But I am like a gr2en olive tr2e in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever. 
I wi2l praise th2e for ever, because thou hast done it: and I wi2l wait on thy name; for it is g2od before thy saints. 
The f2ol hath said in his heart, There is no God. Co2rupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth g2od. 
God l2oked down from heaven upon the children of men, to s2e if there were any that did understand, that did s2ek God. 
Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth g2od, no, not one. 
Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread: they have not ca2led upon God. 
There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath sca2tered the bones of him that encampeth against th2e: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them. 
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob sha2l rejoice, and Israel sha2l be glad. 
Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength. 
Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth. 
For strangers are risen up against me, and o2pre2sors s2ek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah. 
Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul. 
He sha2l reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them o2f in thy truth. 
I wi2l fr2ely sacrifice unto th2e: I wi2l praise thy name, O LORD; for it is g2od. 
For he hath delivered me out of a2l trouble: and mine eye hath s2en his desire upon mine enemies. 
Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my su2plication. 
A2tend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise; 
Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the o2pre2sion of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me. 
My heart is sore pained within me: and the te2rors of death are fa2len upon me. 
Fearfulne2s and trembling are come upon me, and ho2ror hath overwhelmed me. 
And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest. 
Lo, then would I wander far o2f, and remain in the wilderne2s. Selah. 
I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest. 
Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have s2en violence and strife in the city. 
Day and night they go about it upon the wa2ls thereof: mischief also and so2row are in the midst of it. 
Wickedne2s is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her str2ets. 
For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him: 
But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance. 
We t2ok sw2et counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company. 
Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into he2l: for wickedne2s is in their dwe2lings, and among them. 
As for me, I wi2l ca2l upon God; and the LORD sha2l save me. 
Evening, and morning, and at n2on, wi2l I pray, and cry aloud: and he sha2l hear my voice. 
He hath delivered my soul in peace from the ba2tle that was against me: for there were many with me. 
God sha2l hear, and a2flict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God. 
He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant. 
The words of his mouth were sm2other than bu2ter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords. 
Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he sha2l sustain th2e: he sha2l never su2fer the righteous to be moved. 
But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bl2ody and deceitful men sha2l not live out half their days; but I wi2l trust in th2e. 
Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swa2low me up; he fighting daily o2pre2seth me. 
Mine enemies would daily swa2low me up: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High. 
What time I am afraid, I wi2l trust in th2e. 
In God I wi2l praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I wi2l not fear what flesh can do unto me. 
Every day they wrest my words: a2l their thoughts are against me for evil. 
They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul. 
Sha2l they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the people, O God. 
Thou te2lest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bo2tle: are they not in thy b2ok? 
When I cry unto th2e, then sha2l mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me. 
In God wi2l I praise his word: in the LORD wi2l I praise his word. 
In God have I put my trust: I wi2l not be afraid what man can do unto me. 
Thy vows are upon me, O God: I wi2l render praises unto th2e. 
For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my f2et from fa2ling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living? 
Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in th2e: yea, in the shadow of thy wings wi2l I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast. 
I wi2l cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth a2l things for me. 
He sha2l send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that would swa2low me up. Selah. God sha2l send forth his mercy and his truth. 
My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose t2eth are spears and a2rows, and their tongue a sharp sword. 
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above a2l the earth. 
They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have di2ged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fa2len themselves. Selah. 
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I wi2l sing and give praise. 
Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself wi2l awake early. 
I wi2l praise th2e, O Lord, among the people: I wi2l sing unto th2e among the nations. 
For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds. 
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above a2l the earth. 
Do ye ind2ed speak righteousne2s, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men? 
Yea, in heart ye work wickedne2s; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth. 
The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as s2on as they be born, speaking lies. 
Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf a2der that sto2peth her ear; 
Which wi2l not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely. 
Break their t2eth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great t2eth of the young lions, O LORD. 
Let them melt away as waters which run continua2ly: when he bendeth his bow to sh2ot his a2rows, let them be as cut in pieces. 
As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pa2s away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not s2e the sun. 
Before your pots can f2el the thorns, he sha2l take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath. 
The righteous sha2l rejoice when he s2eth the vengeance: he sha2l wash his f2et in the bl2od of the wicked. 
So that a man sha2l say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth. 
Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me. 
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bl2ody men. 
For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgre2sion, nor for my sin, O LORD. 
They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help me, and behold. 
Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit a2l the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgre2sors. Selah. 
They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. 
Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear? 
But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have a2l the heathen in derision. 
Because of his strength wi2l I wait upon th2e: for God is my defence. 
The God of my mercy sha2l prevent me: God sha2l let me s2e my desire upon mine enemies. 
Slay them not, lest my people forget: sca2ter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield. 
For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak. 
Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah. 
And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city. 
Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied. 
But I wi2l sing of thy power; yea, I wi2l sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast b2en my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble. 
Unto th2e, O my strength, wi2l I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy. 
O God, thou hast cast us o2f, thou hast sca2tered us, thou hast b2en displeased; O turn thyself to us again. 
Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh. 
Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment. 
Thou hast given a ba2ner to them that fear th2e, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah. 
That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me. 
God hath spoken in his holine2s; I wi2l rejoice, I wi2l divide Shechem, and mete out the va2ley of Su2coth. 
Gilead is mine, and Mana2seh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver; 
Moab is my washpot; over Edom wi2l I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me. 
Who wi2l bring me into the strong city? who wi2l lead me into Edom? 
Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us o2f? and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies? 
Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. 
Through God we sha2l do valiantly: for he it is that sha2l tread down our enemies. 
Hear my cry, O God; a2tend unto my prayer. 
From the end of the earth wi2l I cry unto th2e, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I. 
For thou hast b2en a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy. 
I wi2l abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I wi2l trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah. 
For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name. 
Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations. 
He sha2l abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him. 
So wi2l I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows. 
Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation. 
He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I sha2l not be greatly moved. 
How long wi2l ye imagine mischief against a man? ye sha2l be slain a2l of you: as a bowing wa2l sha2l ye be, and as a to2tering fence. 
They only consult to cast him down from his exce2lency: they delight in lies: they ble2s with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah. 
My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him. 
He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I sha2l not be moved. 
In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. 
Trust in him at a2l times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah. 
Surely men of low degr2e are vanity, and men of high degr2e are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity. 
Trust not in o2pre2sion, and become not vain in ro2bery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them. 
God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God. 
Also unto th2e, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man a2cording to his work. 
O God, thou art my God; early wi2l I s2ek th2e: my soul thirsteth for th2e, my flesh longeth for th2e in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is; 
To s2e thy power and thy glory, so as I have s2en th2e in the sanctuary. 
Because thy lovingkindne2s is be2ter than life, my lips sha2l praise th2e. 
Thus wi2l I ble2s th2e while I live: I wi2l lift up my hands in thy name. 
My soul sha2l be satisfied as with ma2row and fatne2s; and my mouth sha2l praise th2e with joyful lips: 
When I remember th2e upon my bed, and meditate on th2e in the night watches. 
Because thou hast b2en my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings wi2l I rejoice. 
My soul fo2loweth hard after th2e: thy right hand upholdeth me. 
But those that s2ek my soul, to destroy it, sha2l go into the lower parts of the earth. 
They sha2l fa2l by the sword: they sha2l be a portion for foxes. 
But the king sha2l rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him sha2l glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies sha2l be sto2ped. 
Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy. 
Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insu2rection of the workers of iniquity: 
Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to sh2ot their a2rows, even bi2ter words: 
That they may sh2ot in secret at the perfect: su2denly do they sh2ot at him, and fear not. 
They encourage themselves in an evil ma2ter: they co2mune of laying snares privily; they say, Who sha2l s2e them? 
They search out iniquities; they a2complish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is d2ep. 
But God sha2l sh2ot at them with an a2row; su2denly sha2l they be wounded. 
So they sha2l make their own tongue to fa2l upon themselves: a2l that s2e them sha2l fl2e away. 
And a2l men sha2l fear, and sha2l declare the work of God; for they sha2l wisely consider of his doing. 
The righteous sha2l be glad in the LORD, and sha2l trust in him; and a2l the upright in heart sha2l glory. 
Praise waiteth for th2e, O God, in Sion: and unto th2e sha2l the vow be performed. 
O thou that hearest prayer, unto th2e sha2l a2l flesh come. 
Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgre2sions, thou shalt purge them away. 
Ble2sed is the man whom thou ch2osest, and causest to a2proach unto th2e, that he may dwe2l in thy courts: we sha2l be satisfied with the g2odne2s of thy house, even of thy holy temple. 
By te2rible things in righteousne2s wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of a2l the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar o2f upon the sea: 
Which by his strength se2teth fast the mountains; being girded with power: 
Which sti2leth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people. 
They also that dwe2l in the u2termost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice. 
Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is fu2l of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it. 
Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou se2tlest the fu2rows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou ble2sest the springing thereof. 
Thou crownest the year with thy g2odne2s; and thy paths drop fatne2s. 
They drop upon the pastures of the wilderne2s: and the li2tle hi2ls rejoice on every side. 
The pastures are clothed with flocks; the va2leys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing. 
Make a joyful noise unto God, a2l ye lands: 
Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious. 
Say unto God, How te2rible art thou in thy works! through the greatne2s of thy power sha2l thine enemies submit themselves unto th2e. 
A2l the earth sha2l worship th2e, and sha2l sing unto th2e; they sha2l sing to thy name. Selah. 
Come and s2e the works of God: he is te2rible in his doing toward the children of men. 
He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the fl2od on f2ot: there did we rejoice in him. 
He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebe2lious exalt themselves. Selah. 
O ble2s our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard: 
Which holdeth our soul in life, and su2fereth not our f2et to be moved. 
For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried. 
Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst a2fliction upon our loins. 
Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place. 
I wi2l go into thy house with burnt o2ferings: I wi2l pay th2e my vows, 
Which my lips have u2tered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble. 
I wi2l o2fer unto th2e burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I wi2l o2fer bu2locks with goats. Selah. 
Come and hear, a2l ye that fear God, and I wi2l declare what he hath done for my soul. 
I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was exto2led with my tongue. 
If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord wi2l not hear me: 
But verily God hath heard me; he hath a2tended to the voice of my prayer. 
Ble2sed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me. 
God be merciful unto us, and ble2s us; and cause his face to shine upon us; Selah. 
That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among a2l nations. 
Let the people praise th2e, O God; let a2l the people praise th2e. 
O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah. 
Let the people praise th2e, O God; let a2l the people praise th2e. 
Then sha2l the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, sha2l ble2s us. 
God sha2l ble2s us; and a2l the ends of the earth sha2l fear him. 
Let God arise, let his enemies be sca2tered: let them also that hate him fl2e before him. 
As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God. 
But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exc2edingly rejoice. 
Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him. 
A father of the fatherle2s, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation. 
God se2teth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebe2lious dwe2l in a dry land. 
O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderne2s; Selah: 
The earth sh2ok, the heavens also dro2ped at the presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel. 
Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary. 
Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy g2odne2s for the p2or. 
The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it. 
Kings of armies did fl2e apace: and she that ta2ried at home divided the spoil. 
Though ye have lien among the pots, yet sha2l ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with ye2low gold. 
When the Almighty sca2tered kings in it, it was white as snow in Salmon. 
The hi2l of God is as the hi2l of Bashan; an high hi2l as the hi2l of Bashan. 
Why leap ye, ye high hi2ls? this is the hi2l which God desireth to dwe2l in; yea, the LORD wi2l dwe2l in it for ever. 
The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place. 
Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebe2lious also, that the LORD God might dwe2l among them. 
Ble2sed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation. Selah. 
He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord belong the i2sues from death. 
But God sha2l wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on sti2l in his trespa2ses. 
The Lord said, I wi2l bring again from Bashan, I wi2l bring my people again from the depths of the sea: 
That thy f2ot may be di2ped in the bl2od of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same. 
They have s2en thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary. 
The singers went before, the players on instruments fo2lowed after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels. 
Ble2s ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel. 
There is li2tle Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali. 
Thy God hath co2manded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us. 
Because of thy temple at Jerusalem sha2l kings bring presents unto th2e. 
Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bu2ls, with the calves of the people, ti2l every one submit himself with pieces of silver: sca2ter thou the people that delight in war. 
Princes sha2l come out of Egypt; Ethiopia sha2l s2on stretch out her hands unto God. 
Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah: 
To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice. 
Ascribe ye strength unto God: his exce2lency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds. 
O God, thou art te2rible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Ble2sed be God. 
Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul. 
I sink in d2ep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into d2ep waters, where the fl2ods overflow me. 
I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God. 
They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfu2ly, are mighty: then I restored that which I t2ok not away. 
O God, thou knowest my f2olishne2s; and my sins are not hid from th2e. 
Let not them that wait on th2e, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that s2ek th2e be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel. 
Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face. 
I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children. 
For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached th2e are fa2len upon me. 
When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach. 
I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them. 
They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards. 
But as for me, my prayer is unto th2e, O LORD, in an a2ceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation. 
Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the d2ep waters. 
Let not the waterfl2od overflow me, neither let the d2ep swa2low me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me. 
Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindne2s is g2od: turn unto me a2cording to the multitude of thy tender mercies. 
And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me sp2edily. 
Draw nigh unto my soul, and red2em it: deliver me because of mine enemies. 
Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are a2l before th2e. 
Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am fu2l of heavine2s: and I l2oked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none. 
They gave me also ga2l for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. 
Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have b2en for their welfare, let it become a trap. 
Let their eyes be darkened, that they s2e not; and make their loins continua2ly to shake. 
Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them. 
Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwe2l in their tents. 
For they persecute him whom thou hast smi2ten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded. 
A2d iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousne2s. 
Let them be blo2ted out of the b2ok of the living, and not be wri2ten with the righteous. 
But I am p2or and so2rowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high. 
I wi2l praise the name of God with a song, and wi2l magnify him with thanksgiving. 
This also sha2l please the LORD be2ter than an ox or bu2lock that hath horns and h2ofs. 
The humble sha2l s2e this, and be glad: and your heart sha2l live that s2ek God. 
For the LORD heareth the p2or, and despiseth not his prisoners. 
Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein. 
For God wi2l save Zion, and wi2l build the cities of Judah: that they may dwe2l there, and have it in po2se2sion. 
The s2ed also of his servants sha2l inherit it: and they that love his name sha2l dwe2l therein. 
MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O LORD. 
Let them be ashamed and confounded that s2ek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt. 
Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha. 
Let a2l those that s2ek th2e rejoice and be glad in th2e: and let such as love thy salvation say continua2ly, Let God be magnified. 
But I am p2or and n2edy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no ta2rying. 
In th2e, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion. 
Deliver me in thy righteousne2s, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me. 
Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continua2ly resort: thou hast given co2mandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my fortre2s. 
Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man. 
For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my youth. 
By th2e have I b2en holden up from the womb: thou art he that t2ok me out of my mother's bowels: my praise sha2l be continua2ly of th2e. 
I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge. 
Let my mouth be fi2led with thy praise and with thy honour a2l the day. 
Cast me not o2f in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth. 
For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together, 
Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him. 
O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help. 
Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that s2ek my hurt. 
But I wi2l hope continua2ly, and wi2l yet praise th2e more and more. 
My mouth sha2l shew forth thy righteousne2s and thy salvation a2l the day; for I know not the numbers thereof. 
I wi2l go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I wi2l make mention of thy righteousne2s, even of thine only. 
O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works. 
Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come. 
Thy righteousne2s also, O God, is very high, who hast done great things: O God, who is like unto th2e! 
Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth. 
Thou shalt increase my greatne2s, and comfort me on every side. 
I wi2l also praise th2e with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: unto th2e wi2l I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel. 
My lips sha2l greatly rejoice when I sing unto th2e; and my soul, which thou hast red2emed. 
My tongue also sha2l talk of thy righteousne2s a2l the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that s2ek my hurt. 
Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousne2s unto the king's son. 
He sha2l judge thy people with righteousne2s, and thy p2or with judgment. 
The mountains sha2l bring peace to the people, and the li2tle hi2ls, by righteousne2s. 
He sha2l judge the p2or of the people, he sha2l save the children of the n2edy, and sha2l break in pieces the o2pre2sor. 
They sha2l fear th2e as long as the sun and m2on endure, throughout a2l generations. 
He sha2l come down like rain upon the mown gra2s: as showers that water the earth. 
In his days sha2l the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the m2on endureth. 
He sha2l have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. 
They that dwe2l in the wilderne2s sha2l bow before him; and his enemies sha2l lick the dust. 
The kings of Tarshish and of the isles sha2l bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba sha2l o2fer gifts. 
Yea, a2l kings sha2l fa2l down before him: a2l nations sha2l serve him. 
For he sha2l deliver the n2edy when he crieth; the p2or also, and him that hath no helper. 
He sha2l spare the p2or and n2edy, and sha2l save the souls of the n2edy. 
He sha2l red2em their soul from deceit and violence: and precious sha2l their bl2od be in his sight. 
And he sha2l live, and to him sha2l be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also sha2l be made for him continua2ly; and daily sha2l he be praised. 
There sha2l be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof sha2l shake like Lebanon: and they of the city sha2l flourish like gra2s of the earth. 
His name sha2l endure for ever: his name sha2l be continued as long as the sun: and men sha2l be ble2sed in him: a2l nations sha2l ca2l him ble2sed. 
Ble2sed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things. 
And ble2sed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be fi2led with his glory; Amen, and Amen. 
The prayers of David the son of Je2se are ended. 
Truly God is g2od to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart. 
But as for me, my f2et were almost gone; my steps had we2l nigh sli2ped. 
For I was envious at the f2olish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 
For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm. 
They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men. 
Therefore pride compa2seth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment. 
Their eyes stand out with fatne2s: they have more than heart could wish. 
They are co2rupt, and speak wickedly concerning o2pre2sion: they speak loftily. 
They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth. 
Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a fu2l cup are wrung out to them. 
And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High? 
Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches. 
Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in i2nocency. 
For a2l the day long have I b2en plagued, and chastened every morning. 
If I say, I wi2l speak thus; behold, I should o2fend against the generation of thy children. 
When I thought to know this, it was t2o painful for me; 
Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then underst2od I their end. 
Surely thou didst set them in sli2pery places: thou castedst them down into destruction. 
How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are u2terly consumed with te2rors. 
As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image. 
Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins. 
So f2olish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before th2e. 
Neverthele2s I am continua2ly with th2e: thou hast holden me by my right hand. 
Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory. 
Whom have I in heaven but th2e? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside th2e. 
My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever. 
For, lo, they that are far from th2e sha2l perish: thou hast destroyed a2l them that go a whoring from th2e. 
But it is g2od for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare a2l thy works. 
O God, why hast thou cast us o2f for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sh2ep of thy pasture? 
Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast red2emed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt. 
Lift up thy f2et unto the perpetual desolations; even a2l that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. 
Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs. 
A man was famous a2cording as he had lifted up axes upon the thick tr2es. 
But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and ha2mers. 
They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwe2ling place of thy name to the ground. 
They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up a2l the synagogues of God in the land. 
We s2e not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long. 
O God, how long sha2l the adversary reproach? sha2l the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever? 
Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom. 
For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth. 
Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters. 
Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderne2s. 
Thou didst cleave the fountain and the fl2od: thou driedst up mighty rivers. 
The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun. 
Thou hast set a2l the borders of the earth: thou hast made su2mer and winter. 
Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that the f2olish people have blasphemed thy name. 
O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy p2or for ever. 
Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are fu2l of the habitations of cruelty. 
O let not the o2pre2sed return ashamed: let the p2or and n2edy praise thy name. 
Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the f2olish man reproacheth th2e daily. 
Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against th2e increaseth continua2ly. 
Unto th2e, O God, do we give thanks, unto th2e do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare. 
When I sha2l receive the congregation I wi2l judge uprightly. 
The earth and a2l the inhabitants thereof are di2solved: I bear up the pi2lars of it. Selah. 
I said unto the f2ols, Deal not f2olishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: 
Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a sti2f neck. 
For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. 
But God is the judge: he pu2teth down one, and se2teth up another. 
For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is fu2l of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, a2l the wicked of the earth sha2l wring them out, and drink them. 
But I wi2l declare for ever; I wi2l sing praises to the God of Jacob. 
A2l the horns of the wicked also wi2l I cut o2f; but the horns of the righteous sha2l be exalted. 
In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel. 
In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwe2ling place in Zion. 
There brake he the a2rows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the ba2tle. Selah. 
Thou art more glorious and exce2lent than the mountains of prey. 
The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sl2ep: and none of the men of might have found their hands. 
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sl2ep. 
Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry? 
Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was sti2l, 
When God arose to judgment, to save a2l the m2ek of the earth. Selah. 
Surely the wrath of man sha2l praise th2e: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain. 
Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let a2l that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. 
He sha2l cut o2f the spirit of princes: he is te2rible to the kings of the earth. 
I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me. 
In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted. 
I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah. 
Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I ca2not speak. 
I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times. 
I ca2l to remembrance my song in the night: I co2mune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search. 
Wi2l the Lord cast o2f for ever? and wi2l he be favourable no more? 
Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore? 
Hath God forgo2ten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah. 
And I said, This is my infirmity: but I wi2l remember the years of the right hand of the most High. 
I wi2l remember the works of the LORD: surely I wi2l remember thy wonders of old. 
I wi2l meditate also of a2l thy work, and talk of thy doings. 
Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God? 
Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people. 
Thou hast with thine arm red2emed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah. 
The waters saw th2e, O God, the waters saw th2e; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled. 
The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine a2rows also went abroad. 
The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and sh2ok. 
Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy f2otsteps are not known. 
Thou le2dest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron. 
Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. 
I wi2l open my mouth in a parable: I wi2l u2ter dark sayings of old: 
Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. 
We wi2l not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. 
For he established a testimony in Jacob, and a2pointed a law in Israel, which he co2manded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: 
That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children: 
That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but k2ep his co2mandments: 
And might not be as their fathers, a stu2born and rebe2lious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God. 
The children of Ephraim, being armed, and ca2rying bows, turned back in the day of ba2tle. 
They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; 
And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them. 
Marve2lous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. 
He divided the sea, and caused them to pa2s through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap. 
In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and a2l the night with a light of fire. 
He clave the rocks in the wilderne2s, and gave them drink as out of the great depths. 
He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. 
And they si2ned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderne2s. 
And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust. 
Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderne2s? 
Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? 
Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel; 
Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation: 
Though he had co2manded the clouds from above, and opened the d2ors of heaven, 
And had rained down ma2na upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven. 
Man did eat angels' f2od: he sent them meat to the fu2l. 
He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. 
He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea: 
And he let it fa2l in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations. 
So they did eat, and were we2l fi2led: for he gave them their own desire; 
They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths, 
The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fa2test of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel. 
For a2l this they si2ned sti2l, and believed not for his wondrous works. 
Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. 
When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. 
And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their red2emer. 
Neverthele2s they did fla2ter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues. 
For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant. 
But he, being fu2l of compa2sion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up a2l his wrath. 
For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that pa2seth away, and cometh not again. 
How oft did they provoke him in the wilderne2s, and grieve him in the desert! 
Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel. 
They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy. 
How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan. 
And had turned their rivers into bl2od; and their fl2ods, that they could not drink. 
He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. 
He gave also their increase unto the caterpi2ler, and their labour unto the locust. 
He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore tr2es with frost. 
He gave up their ca2tle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. 
He cast upon them the fiercene2s of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them. 
He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; 
And smote a2l the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham: 
But made his own people to go forth like sh2ep, and guided them in the wilderne2s like a flock. 
And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. 
And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased. 
He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwe2l in their tents. 
Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies: 
But turned back, and dealt unfaithfu2ly like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. 
For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. 
When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abho2red Israel: 
So that he fors2ok the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men; 
And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand. 
He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. 
The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to ma2riage. 
Their priests fe2l by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. 
Then the LORD awaked as one out of sl2ep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. 
And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach. 
Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: 
But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. 
And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever. 
He chose David also his servant, and t2ok him from the sh2epfolds: 
From fo2lowing the ewes great with young he brought him to f2ed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. 
So he fed them a2cording to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulne2s of his hands. 
O god, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps. 
The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth. 
Their bl2od have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them. 
We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us. 
How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? sha2l thy jealousy burn like fire? 
Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known th2e, and upon the kingdoms that have not ca2led upon thy name. 
For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwe2ling place. 
O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies sp2edily prevent us: for we are brought very low. 
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake. 
Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the bl2od of thy servants which is shed. 
Let the sighing of the prisoner come before th2e; a2cording to the greatne2s of thy power preserve thou those that are a2pointed to die; 
And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached th2e, O Lord. 
So we thy people and sh2ep of thy pasture wi2l give th2e thanks for ever: we wi2l shew forth thy praise to a2l generations. 
Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwe2lest betw2en the cherubims, shine forth. 
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Mana2seh stir up thy strength, and come and save us. 
Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we sha2l be saved. 
O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people? 
Thou f2edest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure. 
Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves. 
Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we sha2l be saved. 
Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. 
Thou preparedst r2om before it, and didst cause it to take d2ep r2ot, and it fi2led the land. 
The hi2ls were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the g2odly cedars. 
She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river. 
Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that a2l they which pa2s by the way do pluck her? 
The boar out of the w2od doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it. 
Return, we bes2ech th2e, O God of hosts: l2ok down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine; 
And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself. 
It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance. 
Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself. 
So wi2l not we go back from th2e: quicken us, and we wi2l ca2l upon thy name. 
Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we sha2l be saved. 
Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob. 
Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery. 
Blow up the trumpet in the new m2on, in the time a2pointed, on our solemn feast day. 
For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob. 
This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I underst2od not. 
I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots. 
Thou ca2ledst in trouble, and I delivered th2e; I answered th2e in the secret place of thunder: I proved th2e at the waters of Meribah. Selah. 
Hear, O my people, and I wi2l testify unto th2e: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me; 
There sha2l no strange god be in th2e; neither shalt thou worship any strange god. 
I am the LORD thy God, which brought th2e out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I wi2l fi2l it. 
But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me. 
So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels. 
Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways! 
I should s2on have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries. 
The haters of the LORD should have submi2ted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever. 
He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied th2e. 
God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. 
How long wi2l ye judge unjustly, and a2cept the persons of the wicked? Selah. 
Defend the p2or and fatherle2s: do justice to the a2flicted and n2edy. 
Deliver the p2or and n2edy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked. 
They know not, neither wi2l they understand; they walk on in darkne2s: a2l the foundations of the earth are out of course. 
I have said, Ye are gods; and a2l of you are children of the most High. 
But ye sha2l die like men, and fa2l like one of the princes. 
Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit a2l nations. 
K2ep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not sti2l, O God. 
For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate th2e have lifted up the head. 
They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hi2den ones. 
They have said, Come, and let us cut them o2f from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. 
For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against th2e: 
The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes; 
Gebal, and A2mon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre; 
A2sur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah. 
Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the br2ok of Kison: 
Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth. 
Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Z2eb: yea, a2l their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmu2na: 
Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in po2se2sion. 
O my God, make them like a wh2el; as the stu2ble before the wind. 
As the fire burneth a w2od, and as the flame se2teth the mountains on fire; 
So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. 
Fi2l their faces with shame; that they may s2ek thy name, O LORD. 
Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish: 
That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over a2l the earth. 
How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts! 
My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God. 
Yea, the spa2row hath found an house, and the swa2low a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God. 
Ble2sed are they that dwe2l in thy house: they wi2l be sti2l praising th2e. Selah. 
Ble2sed is the man whose strength is in th2e; in whose heart are the ways of them. 
Who pa2sing through the va2ley of Baca make it a we2l; the rain also fi2leth the p2ols. 
They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion a2peareth before God. 
O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah. 
Behold, O God our shield, and l2ok upon the face of thine anointed. 
For a day in thy courts is be2ter than a thousand. I had rather be a d2ork2eper in the house of my God, than to dwe2l in the tents of wickedne2s. 
For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD wi2l give grace and glory: no g2od thing wi2l he wit2hold from them that walk uprightly. 
O LORD of hosts, ble2sed is the man that trusteth in th2e. 
Lord, thou hast b2en favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob. 
Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered a2l their sin. Selah. 
Thou hast taken away a2l thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fiercene2s of thine anger. 
Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease. 
Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to a2l generations? 
Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in th2e? 
Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation. 
I wi2l hear what God the LORD wi2l speak: for he wi2l speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to fo2ly. 
Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwe2l in our land. 
Mercy and truth are met together; righteousne2s and peace have ki2sed each other. 
Truth sha2l spring out of the earth; and righteousne2s sha2l l2ok down from heaven. 
Yea, the LORD sha2l give that which is g2od; and our land sha2l yield her increase. 
Righteousne2s sha2l go before him; and sha2l set us in the way of his steps. 
Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am p2or and n2edy. 
Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in th2e. 
Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto th2e daily. 
Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto th2e, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. 
For thou, Lord, art g2od, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto a2l them that ca2l upon th2e. 
Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and a2tend to the voice of my su2plications. 
In the day of my trouble I wi2l ca2l upon th2e: for thou wilt answer me. 
Among the gods there is none like unto th2e, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works. 
A2l nations whom thou hast made sha2l come and worship before th2e, O Lord; and sha2l glorify thy name. 
For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone. 
Teach me thy way, O LORD; I wi2l walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name. 
I wi2l praise th2e, O Lord my God, with a2l my heart: and I wi2l glorify thy name for evermore. 
For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest he2l. 
O God, the proud are risen against me, and the a2semblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set th2e before them. 
But thou, O Lord, art a God fu2l of compa2sion, and gracious, long su2fering, and plenteous in mercy and truth. 
O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid. 
Shew me a token for g2od; that they which hate me may s2e it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me. 
His foundation is in the holy mountains. 
The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than a2l the dwe2lings of Jacob. 
Glorious things are spoken of th2e, O city of God. Selah. 
I wi2l make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there. 
And of Zion it sha2l be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself sha2l establish her. 
The LORD sha2l count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah. 
As we2l the singers as the players on instruments sha2l be there: a2l my springs are in th2e. 
O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before th2e: 
Let my prayer come before th2e: incline thine ear unto my cry; 
For my soul is fu2l of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave. 
I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that hath no strength: 
Fr2e among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut o2f from thy hand. 
Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkne2s, in the d2eps. 
Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast a2flicted me with a2l thy waves. Selah. 
Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I ca2not come forth. 
Mine eye mourneth by reason of a2fliction: LORD, I have ca2led daily upon th2e, I have stretched out my hands unto th2e. 
Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? sha2l the dead arise and praise th2e? Selah. 
Sha2l thy lovingkindne2s be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulne2s in destruction? 
Sha2l thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousne2s in the land of forgetfulne2s? 
But unto th2e have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning sha2l my prayer prevent th2e. 
LORD, why castest thou o2f my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me? 
I am a2flicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I su2fer thy te2rors I am distracted. 
Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy te2rors have cut me o2f. 
They came round about me daily like water; they compa2sed me about together. 
Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkne2s. 
I wi2l sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth wi2l I make known thy faithfulne2s to a2l generations. 
For I have said, Mercy sha2l be built up for ever: thy faithfulne2s shalt thou establish in the very heavens. 
I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant, 
Thy s2ed wi2l I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to a2l generations. Selah. 
And the heavens sha2l praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulne2s also in the congregation of the saints. 
For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD? 
God is greatly to be feared in the a2sembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of a2l them that are about him. 
O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto th2e? or to thy faithfulne2s round about th2e? 
Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou sti2lest them. 
Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast sca2tered thine enemies with thy strong arm. 
The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulne2s thereof, thou hast founded them. 
The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon sha2l rejoice in thy name. 
Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand. 
Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth sha2l go before thy face. 
Ble2sed is the people that know the joyful sound: they sha2l walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance. 
In thy name sha2l they rejoice a2l the day: and in thy righteousne2s sha2l they be exalted. 
For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn sha2l be exalted. 
For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king. 
Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people. 
I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him: 
With whom my hand sha2l be established: mine arm also sha2l strengthen him. 
The enemy sha2l not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedne2s a2flict him. 
And I wi2l beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him. 
But my faithfulne2s and my mercy sha2l be with him: and in my name sha2l his horn be exalted. 
I wi2l set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers. 
He sha2l cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation. 
Also I wi2l make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth. 
My mercy wi2l I k2ep for him for evermore, and my covenant sha2l stand fast with him. 
His s2ed also wi2l I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven. 
If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; 
If they break my statutes, and k2ep not my co2mandments; 
Then wi2l I visit their transgre2sion with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. 
Neverthele2s my lovingkindne2s wi2l I not u2terly take from him, nor su2fer my faithfulne2s to fail. 
My covenant wi2l I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. 
Once have I sworn by my holine2s that I wi2l not lie unto David. 
His s2ed sha2l endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. 
It sha2l be established for ever as the m2on, and as a faithful witne2s in heaven. Selah. 
But thou hast cast o2f and abho2red, thou hast b2en wroth with thine anointed. 
Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground. 
Thou hast broken down a2l his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin. 
A2l that pa2s by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours. 
Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made a2l his enemies to rejoice. 
Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the ba2tle. 
Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground. 
The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah. 
How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? sha2l thy wrath burn like fire? 
Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made a2l men in vain? 
What man is he that liveth, and sha2l not s2e death? sha2l he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah. 
Lord, where are thy former lovingkindne2ses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth? 
Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of a2l the mighty people; 
Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the f2otsteps of thine anointed. 
Ble2sed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen. 
Lord, thou hast b2en our dwe2ling place in a2l generations. 
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God. 
Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men. 
For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night. 
Thou ca2riest them away as with a fl2od; they are as a sl2ep: in the morning they are like gra2s which groweth up. 
In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth. 
For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled. 
Thou hast set our iniquities before th2e, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance. 
For a2l our days are pa2sed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told. 
The days of our years are thr2escore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and so2row; for it is s2on cut o2f, and we fly away. 
Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even a2cording to thy fear, so is thy wrath. 
So teach us to number our days, that we may a2ply our hearts unto wisdom. 
Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent th2e concerning thy servants. 
O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad a2l our days. 
Make us glad a2cording to the days wherein thou hast a2flicted us, and the years wherein we have s2en evil. 
Let thy work a2pear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children. 
And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it. 
He that dwe2leth in the secret place of the most High sha2l abide under the shadow of the Almighty. 
I wi2l say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortre2s: my God; in him wi2l I trust. 
Surely he sha2l deliver th2e from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. 
He sha2l cover th2e with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth sha2l be thy shield and buckler. 
Thou shalt not be afraid for the te2ror by night; nor for the a2row that flieth by day; 
Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkne2s; nor for the destruction that wasteth at n2onday. 
A thousand sha2l fa2l at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it sha2l not come nigh th2e. 
Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and s2e the reward of the wicked. 
Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; 
There sha2l no evil befa2l th2e, neither sha2l any plague come nigh thy dwe2ling. 
For he sha2l give his angels charge over th2e, to k2ep th2e in a2l thy ways. 
They sha2l bear th2e up in their hands, lest thou dash thy f2ot against a stone. 
Thou shalt tread upon the lion and a2der: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under f2et. 
Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore wi2l I deliver him: I wi2l set him on high, because he hath known my name. 
He sha2l ca2l upon me, and I wi2l answer him: I wi2l be with him in trouble; I wi2l deliver him, and honour him. 
With long life wi2l I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation. 
IT IS A G2OD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD, AND TO SING PRAISES UNTO THY NAME, O MOST HIGH: 
To shew forth thy lovingkindne2s in the morning, and thy faithfulne2s every night, 
Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound. 
For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I wi2l triumph in the works of thy hands. 
O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very d2ep. 
A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a f2ol understand this. 
When the wicked spring as the gra2s, and when a2l the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they sha2l be destroyed for ever: 
But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore. 
For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies sha2l perish; a2l the workers of iniquity sha2l be sca2tered. 
But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I sha2l be anointed with fresh oil. 
Mine eye also sha2l s2e my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears sha2l hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me. 
The righteous sha2l flourish like the palm tr2e: he sha2l grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 
Those that be planted in the house of the LORD sha2l flourish in the courts of our God. 
They sha2l sti2l bring forth fruit in old age; they sha2l be fat and flourishing; 
To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousne2s in him. 
The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it ca2not be moved. 
Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting. 
The fl2ods have lifted up, O LORD, the fl2ods have lifted up their voice; the fl2ods lift up their waves. 
The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea. 
Thy testimonies are very sure: holine2s becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever. 
O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself. 
Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud. 
LORD, how long sha2l the wicked, how long sha2l the wicked triumph? 
How long sha2l they u2ter and speak hard things? and a2l the workers of iniquity boast themselves? 
They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and a2flict thine heritage. 
They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherle2s. 
Yet they say, The LORD sha2l not s2e, neither sha2l the God of Jacob regard it. 
Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye f2ols, when wi2l ye be wise? 
He that planted the ear, sha2l he not hear? he that formed the eye, sha2l he not s2e? 
He that chastiseth the heathen, sha2l not he co2rect? he that teacheth man knowledge, sha2l not he know? 
The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity. 
Ble2sed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law; 
That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be di2ged for the wicked. 
For the LORD wi2l not cast o2f his people, neither wi2l he forsake his inheritance. 
But judgment sha2l return unto righteousne2s: and a2l the upright in heart sha2l fo2low it. 
Who wi2l rise up for me against the evildoers? or who wi2l stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? 
Unle2s the LORD had b2en my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence. 
When I said, My f2ot sli2peth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up. 
In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul. 
Sha2l the throne of iniquity have fe2lowship with th2e, which frameth mischief by a law? 
They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the i2nocent bl2od. 
But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge. 
And he sha2l bring upon them their own iniquity, and sha2l cut them o2f in their own wickedne2s; yea, the LORD our God sha2l cut them o2f. 
O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. 
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms. 
For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above a2l gods. 
In his hand are the d2ep places of the earth: the strength of the hi2ls is his also. 
The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land. 
O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kn2el before the LORD our maker. 
For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sh2ep of his hand. To day if ye wi2l hear his voice, 
Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderne2s: 
When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work. 
Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do e2r in their heart, and they have not known my ways: 
Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest. 
O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, a2l the earth. 
Sing unto the LORD, ble2s his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day. 
Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among a2l people. 
For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above a2l gods. 
For a2l the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens. 
Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 
Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength. 
Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an o2fering, and come into his courts. 
O worship the LORD in the beauty of holine2s: fear before him, a2l the earth. 
Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also sha2l be established that it sha2l not be moved: he sha2l judge the people righteously. 
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulne2s thereof. 
Let the field be joyful, and a2l that is therein: then sha2l a2l the tr2es of the w2od rejoice 
Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he sha2l judge the world with righteousne2s, and the people with his truth. 
The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof. 
Clouds and darkne2s are round about him: righteousne2s and judgment are the habitation of his throne. 
A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about. 
His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled. 
The hi2ls melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 
The heavens declare his righteousne2s, and a2l the people s2e his glory. 
Confounded be a2l they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, a2l ye gods. 
Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD. 
For thou, LORD, art high above a2l the earth: thou art exalted far above a2l gods. 
Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. 
Light is sown for the righteous, and gladne2s for the upright in heart. 
Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holine2s. 
O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marve2lous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath go2ten him the victory. 
The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousne2s hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen. 
He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: a2l the ends of the earth have s2en the salvation of our God. 
Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, a2l the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise. 
Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm. 
With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King. 
Let the sea roar, and the fulne2s thereof; the world, and they that dwe2l therein. 
Let the fl2ods clap their hands: let the hi2ls be joyful together 
Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousne2s sha2l he judge the world, and the people with equity. 
The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he si2teth betw2en the cherubims; let the earth be moved. 
The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above a2l the people. 
Let them praise thy great and te2rible name; for it is holy. 
The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousne2s in Jacob. 
Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his f2otst2ol; for he is holy. 
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that ca2l upon his name; they ca2led upon the LORD, and he answered them. 
He spake unto them in the cloudy pi2lar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them. 
Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou t2okest vengeance of their inventions. 
Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hi2l; for the LORD our God is holy. 
Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, a2l ye lands. 
Serve the LORD with gladne2s: come before his presence with singing. 
Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sh2ep of his pasture. 
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and ble2s his name. 
For the LORD is g2od; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to a2l generations. 
I wi2l sing of mercy and judgment: unto th2e, O LORD, wi2l I sing. 
I wi2l behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I wi2l walk within my house with a perfect heart. 
I wi2l set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it sha2l not cleave to me. 
A froward heart sha2l depart from me: I wi2l not know a wicked person. 
Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him wi2l I cut o2f: him that hath an high l2ok and a proud heart wi2l not I su2fer. 
Mine eyes sha2l be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwe2l with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he sha2l serve me. 
He that worketh deceit sha2l not dwe2l within my house: he that te2leth lies sha2l not ta2ry in my sight. 
I wi2l early destroy a2l the wicked of the land; that I may cut o2f a2l wicked doers from the city of the LORD. 
Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto th2e. 
Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I ca2l answer me sp2edily. 
For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth. 
My heart is smi2ten, and withered like gra2s; so that I forget to eat my bread. 
By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin. 
I am like a pelican of the wilderne2s: I am like an owl of the desert. 
I watch, and am as a spa2row alone upon the house top. 
Mine enemies reproach me a2l the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me. 
For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with w2eping. 
Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down. 
My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like gra2s. 
But thou, O LORD, sha2l endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto a2l generations. 
Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come. 
For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof. 
So the heathen sha2l fear the name of the LORD, and a2l the kings of the earth thy glory. 
When the LORD sha2l build up Zion, he sha2l a2pear in his glory. 
He wi2l regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer. 
This sha2l be wri2ten for the generation to come: and the people which sha2l be created sha2l praise the LORD. 
For he hath l2oked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth; 
To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to l2ose those that are a2pointed to death; 
To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem; 
When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD. 
He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days. 
I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout a2l generations. 
Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands. 
They sha2l perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, a2l of them sha2l wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they sha2l be changed: 
But thou art the same, and thy years sha2l have no end. 
The children of thy servants sha2l continue, and their s2ed sha2l be established before th2e. 
Ble2s the LORD, O my soul: and a2l that is within me, ble2s his holy name. 
Ble2s the LORD, O my soul, and forget not a2l his benefits: 
Who forgiveth a2l thine iniquities; who healeth a2l thy diseases; 
Who red2emeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth th2e with lovingkindne2s and tender mercies; 
Who satisfieth thy mouth with g2od things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's. 
The LORD executeth righteousne2s and judgment for a2l that are o2pre2sed. 
He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel. 
The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. 
He wi2l not always chide: neither wi2l he k2ep his anger for ever. 
He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us a2cording to our iniquities. 
For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. 
As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgre2sions from us. 
Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him. 
For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. 
As for man, his days are as gra2s: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. 
For the wind pa2seth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof sha2l know it no more. 
But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousne2s unto children's children; 
To such as k2ep his covenant, and to those that remember his co2mandments to do them. 
The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over a2l. 
Ble2s the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his co2mandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word. 
Ble2s ye the LORD, a2l ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure. 
Ble2s the LORD, a2l his works in a2l places of his dominion: ble2s the LORD, O my soul. 
Ble2s the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty. 
Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain: 
Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind: 
Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire: 
Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever. 
Thou coveredst it with the d2ep as with a garment: the waters st2od above the mountains. 
At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away. 
They go up by the mountains; they go down by the va2leys unto the place which thou hast founded for them. 
Thou hast set a bound that they may not pa2s over; that they turn not again to cover the earth. 
He sendeth the springs into the va2leys, which run among the hi2ls. 
They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild a2ses quench their thirst. 
By them sha2l the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches. 
He watereth the hi2ls from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works. 
He causeth the gra2s to grow for the ca2tle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth f2od out of the earth; 
And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart. 
The tr2es of the LORD are fu2l of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted; 
Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir tr2es are her house. 
The high hi2ls are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies. 
He a2pointed the m2on for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down. 
Thou makest darkne2s, and it is night: wherein a2l the beasts of the forest do cr2ep forth. 
The young lions roar after their prey, and s2ek their meat from God. 
The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens. 
Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening. 
O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them a2l: the earth is fu2l of thy riches. 
So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things cr2eping i2numerable, both sma2l and great beasts. 
There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein. 
These wait a2l upon th2e; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season. 
That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are fi2led with g2od. 
Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust. 
Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth. 
The glory of the LORD sha2l endure for ever: the LORD sha2l rejoice in his works. 
He l2oketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hi2ls, and they smoke. 
I wi2l sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I wi2l sing praise to my God while I have my being. 
My meditation of him sha2l be sw2et: I wi2l be glad in the LORD. 
Let the si2ners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Ble2s thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD. 
O give thanks unto the LORD; ca2l upon his name: make known his d2eds among the people. 
Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of a2l his wondrous works. 
Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that s2ek the LORD. 
S2ek the LORD, and his strength: s2ek his face evermore. 
Remember his marve2lous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; 
O ye s2ed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen. 
He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in a2l the earth. 
He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he co2manded to a thousand generations. 
Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Is2ac; 
And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant: 
Saying, Unto th2e wi2l I give the land of Can2an, the lot of your inheritance: 
When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it. 
When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people; 
He su2fered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; 
Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. 
Moreover he ca2led for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole sta2f of bread. 
He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant: 
Whose f2et they hurt with fe2ters: he was laid in iron: 
Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him. 
The king sent and l2osed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go fr2e. 
He made him lord of his house, and ruler of a2l his substance: 
To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom. 
Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 
And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies. 
He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subti2ly with his servants. 
He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen. 
They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham. 
He sent darkne2s, and made it dark; and they rebe2led not against his word. 
He turned their waters into bl2od, and slew their fish. 
Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings. 
He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in a2l their coasts. 
He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land. 
He smote their vines also and their fig tr2es; and brake the tr2es of their coasts. 
He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpi2lers, and that without number, 
And did eat up a2l the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground. 
He smote also a2l the firstborn in their land, the chief of a2l their strength. 
He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one f2eble person among their tribes. 
Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fe2l upon them. 
He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night. 
The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. 
He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river. 
For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant. 
And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladne2s: 
And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people; 
That they might observe his statutes, and k2ep his laws. Praise ye the LORD. 
Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is g2od: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
Who can u2ter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth a2l his praise? 
Ble2sed are they that k2ep judgment, and he that doeth righteousne2s at a2l times. 
Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation; 
That I may s2e the g2od of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladne2s of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance. 
We have si2ned with our fathers, we have co2mi2ted iniquity, we have done wickedly. 
Our fathers underst2od not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea. 
Neverthele2s he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. 
He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderne2s. 
And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and red2emed them from the hand of the enemy. 
And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left. 
Then believed they his words; they sang his praise. 
They s2on forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel: 
But lusted exc2edingly in the wilderne2s, and tempted God in the desert. 
And he gave them their request; but sent lea2ne2s into their soul. 
They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD. 
The earth opened and swa2lowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram. 
And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. 
They made a calf in Horeb, and worshi2ped the molten image. 
Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth gra2s. 
They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt; 
Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and te2rible things by the Red sea. 
Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen st2od before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them. 
Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word: 
But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD. 
Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderne2s: 
To overthrow their s2ed also among the nations, and to sca2ter them in the lands. 
They joined themselves also unto B2alpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. 
Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them. 
Then st2od up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed. 
And that was counted unto him for righteousne2s unto a2l generations for evermore. 
They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went i2l with Moses for their sakes: 
Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips. 
They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD co2manded them: 
But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. 
And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them. 
Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils, 
And shed i2nocent bl2od, even the bl2od of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Can2an: and the land was po2luted with bl2od. 
Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions. 
Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abho2red his own inheritance. 
And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them. 
Their enemies also o2pre2sed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. 
Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity. 
Neverthele2s he regarded their a2fliction, when he heard their cry: 
And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented a2cording to the multitude of his mercies. 
He made them also to be pitied of a2l those that ca2ried them captives. 
Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. 
Ble2sed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let a2l the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD. 
O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is g2od: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
Let the red2emed of the LORD say so, whom he hath red2emed from the hand of the enemy; 
And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south. 
They wandered in the wilderne2s in a solitary way; they found no city to dwe2l in. 
Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. 
Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distre2ses. 
And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. 
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his g2odne2s, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 
For he satisfieth the longing soul, and fi2leth the hungry soul with g2odne2s. 
Such as sit in darkne2s and in the shadow of death, being bound in a2fliction and iron; 
Because they rebe2led against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High: 
Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fe2l down, and there was none to help. 
Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distre2ses. 
He brought them out of darkne2s and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder. 
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his g2odne2s, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 
For he hath broken the gates of bra2s, and cut the bars of iron in sunder. 
F2ols because of their transgre2sion, and because of their iniquities, are a2flicted. 
Their soul abho2reth a2l ma2ner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death. 
Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distre2ses. 
He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions. 
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his g2odne2s, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 
And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing. 
They that go down to the sea in ships, that do busine2s in great waters; 
These s2e the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the d2ep. 
For he co2mandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. 
They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble. 
They r2el to and fro, and sta2ger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end. 
Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distre2ses. 
He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are sti2l. 
Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven. 
Oh that men would praise the LORD for his g2odne2s, and for his wonderful works to the children of men! 
Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the a2sembly of the elders. 
He turneth rivers into a wilderne2s, and the watersprings into dry ground; 
A fruitful land into ba2re2ne2s, for the wickedne2s of them that dwe2l therein. 
He turneth the wilderne2s into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings. 
And there he maketh the hungry to dwe2l, that they may prepare a city for habitation; 
And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase. 
He ble2seth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and su2fereth not their ca2tle to decrease. 
Again, they are minished and brought low through o2pre2sion, a2fliction, and so2row. 
He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderne2s, where there is no way. 
Yet se2teth he the p2or on high from a2fliction, and maketh him families like a flock. 
The righteous sha2l s2e it, and rejoice: and a2l iniquity sha2l stop her mouth. 
Whoso is wise, and wi2l observe these things, even they sha2l understand the lovingkindne2s of the LORD. 
O god, my heart is fixed; I wi2l sing and give praise, even with my glory. 
Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself wi2l awake early. 
I wi2l praise th2e, O LORD, among the people: and I wi2l sing praises unto th2e among the nations. 
For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds. 
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above a2l the earth; 
That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me. 
God hath spoken in his holine2s; I wi2l rejoice, I wi2l divide Shechem, and mete out the va2ley of Su2coth. 
Gilead is mine; Mana2seh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver; 
Moab is my washpot; over Edom wi2l I cast out my shoe; over Philistia wi2l I triumph. 
Who wi2l bring me into the strong city? who wi2l lead me into Edom? 
Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us o2f? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts? 
Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. 
Through God we sha2l do valiantly: for he it is that sha2l tread down our enemies. 
Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise; 
For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue. 
They compa2sed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause. 
For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer. 
And they have rewarded me evil for g2od, and hatred for my love. 
Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand. 
When he sha2l be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin. 
Let his days be few; and let another take his o2fice. 
Let his children be fatherle2s, and his wife a widow. 
Let his children be continua2ly vagabonds, and beg: let them s2ek their bread also out of their desolate places. 
Let the extortioner catch a2l that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour. 
Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherle2s children. 
Let his posterity be cut o2f; and in the generation fo2lowing let their name be blo2ted out. 
Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blo2ted out. 
Let them be before the LORD continua2ly, that he may cut o2f the memory of them from the earth. 
Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the p2or and n2edy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart. 
As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in ble2sing, so let it be far from him. 
As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones. 
Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continua2ly. 
Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul. 
But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy is g2od, deliver thou me. 
For I am p2or and n2edy, and my heart is wounded within me. 
I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am to2sed up and down as the locust. 
My kn2es are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatne2s. 
I became also a reproach unto them: when they l2oked upon me they shaked their heads. 
Help me, O LORD my God: O save me a2cording to thy mercy: 
That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it. 
Let them curse, but ble2s thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice. 
Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle. 
I wi2l greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I wi2l praise him among the multitude. 
For he sha2l stand at the right hand of the p2or, to save him from those that condemn his soul. 
The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy f2otst2ol. 
The LORD sha2l send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. 
Thy people sha2l be wi2ling in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holine2s from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth. 
The LORD hath sworn, and wi2l not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. 
The Lord at thy right hand sha2l strike through kings in the day of his wrath. 
He sha2l judge among the heathen, he sha2l fi2l the places with the dead bodies; he sha2l wound the heads over many countries. 
He sha2l drink of the br2ok in the way: therefore sha2l he lift up the head. 
Praise ye the LORD. I wi2l praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the a2sembly of the upright, and in the congregation. 
The works of the LORD are great, sought out of a2l them that have pleasure therein. 
His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousne2s endureth for ever. 
He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious and fu2l of compa2sion. 
He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he wi2l ever be mindful of his covenant. 
He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen. 
The works of his hands are verity and judgment; a2l his co2mandments are sure. 
They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightne2s. 
He sent redemption unto his people: he hath co2manded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name. 
The fear of the LORD is the begi2ning of wisdom: a g2od understanding have a2l they that do his co2mandments: his praise endureth for ever. 
Praise ye the LORD. Ble2sed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his co2mandments. 
His s2ed sha2l be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright sha2l be ble2sed. 
Wealth and riches sha2l be in his house: and his righteousne2s endureth for ever. 
Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkne2s: he is gracious, and fu2l of compa2sion, and righteous. 
A g2od man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he wi2l guide his a2fairs with discretion. 
Surely he sha2l not be moved for ever: the righteous sha2l be in everlasting remembrance. 
He sha2l not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD. 
His heart is established, he sha2l not be afraid, until he s2e his desire upon his enemies. 
He hath dispersed, he hath given to the p2or; his righteousne2s endureth for ever; his horn sha2l be exalted with honour. 
The wicked sha2l s2e it, and be grieved; he sha2l gnash with his t2eth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked sha2l perish. 
Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD. 
Ble2sed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. 
From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD's name is to be praised. 
The LORD is high above a2l nations, and his glory above the heavens. 
Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwe2leth on high, 
Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth! 
He raiseth up the p2or out of the dust, and lifteth the n2edy out of the dunghi2l; 
That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people. 
He maketh the ba2ren woman to k2ep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD. 
When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; 
Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion. 
The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back. 
The mountains ski2ped like rams, and the li2tle hi2ls like lambs. 
What ailed th2e, O thou sea, that thou fle2dest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back? 
Ye mountains, that ye ski2ped like rams; and ye li2tle hi2ls, like lambs? 
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; 
Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters. 
Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake. 
Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God? 
But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased. 
Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 
They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they s2e not: 
They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they sme2l not: 
They have hands, but they handle not: f2et have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat. 
They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them. 
O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. 
O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. 
Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield. 
The LORD hath b2en mindful of us: he wi2l ble2s us; he wi2l ble2s the house of Israel; he wi2l ble2s the house of Aaron. 
He wi2l ble2s them that fear the LORD, both sma2l and great. 
The LORD sha2l increase you more and more, you and your children. 
Ye are ble2sed of the LORD which made heaven and earth. 
The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men. 
The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence. 
But we wi2l ble2s the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD. 
I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my su2plications. 
Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore wi2l I ca2l upon him as long as I live. 
The so2rows of death compa2sed me, and the pains of he2l gat hold upon me: I found trouble and so2row. 
Then ca2led I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I bes2ech th2e, deliver my soul. 
Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful. 
The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me. 
Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifu2ly with th2e. 
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my f2et from fa2ling. 
I wi2l walk before the LORD in the land of the living. 
I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly a2flicted: 
I said in my haste, A2l men are liars. 
What sha2l I render unto the LORD for a2l his benefits toward me? 
I wi2l take the cup of salvation, and ca2l upon the name of the LORD. 
I wi2l pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of a2l his people. 
Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints. 
O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast l2osed my bonds. 
I wi2l o2fer to th2e the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and wi2l ca2l upon the name of the LORD. 
I wi2l pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of a2l his people. 
In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of th2e, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD. 
O praise the LORD, a2l ye nations: praise him, a2l ye people. 
For his merciful kindne2s is great toward us: and the truth of the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD. 
O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is g2od: because his mercy endureth for ever. 
Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever. 
Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever. 
Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for ever. 
I ca2led upon the LORD in distre2s: the LORD answered me, and set me in a large place. 
The LORD is on my side; I wi2l not fear: what can man do unto me? 
The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore sha2l I s2e my desire upon them that hate me. 
It is be2ter to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man. 
It is be2ter to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes. 
A2l nations compa2sed me about: but in the name of the LORD wi2l I destroy them. 
They compa2sed me about; yea, they compa2sed me about: but in the name of the LORD I wi2l destroy them. 
They compa2sed me about like b2es: they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I wi2l destroy them. 
Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fa2l: but the LORD helped me. 
The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation. 
The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. 
The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly. 
I sha2l not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD. 
The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death. 
Open to me the gates of righteousne2s: I wi2l go into them, and I wi2l praise the LORD: 
This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous sha2l enter. 
I wi2l praise th2e: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation. 
The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner. 
This is the LORD's doing; it is marve2lous in our eyes. 
This is the day which the LORD hath made; we wi2l rejoice and be glad in it. 
Save now, I bes2ech th2e, O LORD: O LORD, I bes2ech th2e, send now prosperity. 
Ble2sed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have ble2sed you out of the house of the LORD. 
God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar. 
Thou art my God, and I wi2l praise th2e: thou art my God, I wi2l exalt th2e. 
O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is g2od: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
Ble2sed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD. 
Ble2sed are they that k2ep his testimonies, and that s2ek him with the whole heart. 
They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways. 
Thou hast co2manded us to k2ep thy precepts diligently. 
O that my ways were directed to k2ep thy statutes! 
Then sha2l I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto a2l thy co2mandments. 
I wi2l praise th2e with uprightne2s of heart, when I sha2l have learned thy righteous judgments. 
I wi2l k2ep thy statutes: O forsake me not u2terly. 
Wherewithal sha2l a young man cleanse his way? by taking h2ed thereto a2cording to thy word. 
With my whole heart have I sought th2e: O let me not wander from thy co2mandments. 
Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against th2e. 
Ble2sed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes. 
With my lips have I declared a2l the judgments of thy mouth. 
I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in a2l riches. 
I wi2l meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways. 
I wi2l delight myself in thy statutes: I wi2l not forget thy word. 
Deal bountifu2ly with thy servant, that I may live, and k2ep thy word. 
Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law. 
I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy co2mandments from me. 
My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at a2l times. 
Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do e2r from thy co2mandments. 
Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies. 
Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes. 
Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counse2lors.leth. 
My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me a2cording to thy word. 
I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes. 
Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so sha2l I talk of thy wondrous works. 
My soul melteth for heavine2s: strengthen thou me a2cording unto thy word. 
Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously. 
I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me. 
I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame. 
I wi2l run the way of thy co2mandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart. 
Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I sha2l k2ep it unto the end. 
Give me understanding, and I sha2l k2ep thy law; yea, I sha2l observe it with my whole heart. 
Make me to go in the path of thy co2mandments; for therein do I delight. 
Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousne2s. 
Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way. 
Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear. 
Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are g2od. 
Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousne2s. 
Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, a2cording to thy word. 
So sha2l I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word. 
And take not the word of truth u2terly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments. 
So sha2l I k2ep thy law continua2ly for ever and ever. 
And I wi2l walk at liberty: for I s2ek thy precepts. 
I wi2l speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and wi2l not be ashamed. 
And I wi2l delight myself in thy co2mandments, which I have loved. 
My hands also wi2l I lift up unto thy co2mandments, which I have loved; and I wi2l meditate in thy statutes. 
Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope. 
This is my comfort in my a2fliction: for thy word hath quickened me. 
The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law. 
I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself. 
Ho2ror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law. 
Thy statutes have b2en my songs in the house of my pilgrimage. 
I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law. 
This I had, because I kept thy precepts. 
Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would k2ep thy words. 
I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me a2cording to thy word. 
I thought on my ways, and turned my f2et unto thy testimonies. 
I made haste, and delayed not to k2ep thy co2mandments. 
The bands of the wicked have ro2bed me: but I have not forgo2ten thy law. 
At midnight I wi2l rise to give thanks unto th2e because of thy righteous judgments. 
I am a companion of a2l them that fear th2e, and of them that k2ep thy precepts. 
The earth, O LORD, is fu2l of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes. 
Thou hast dealt we2l with thy servant, O LORD, a2cording unto thy word. 
Teach me g2od judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy co2mandments. 
Before I was a2flicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word. 
Thou art g2od, and doest g2od; teach me thy statutes. 
The proud have forged a lie against me: but I wi2l k2ep thy precepts with my whole heart. 
Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law. 
It is g2od for me that I have b2en a2flicted; that I might learn thy statutes. 
The law of thy mouth is be2ter unto me than thousands of gold and silver. 
Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy co2mandments. 
They that fear th2e wi2l be glad when they s2e me; because I have hoped in thy word. 
I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulne2s hast a2flicted me. 
Let, I pray th2e, thy merciful kindne2s be for my comfort, a2cording to thy word unto thy servant. 
Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight. 
Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I wi2l meditate in thy precepts. 
Let those that fear th2e turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies. 
Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed. 
My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word. 
Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me? 
For I am become like a bo2tle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes. 
How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me? 
The proud have di2ged pits for me, which are not after thy law. 
A2l thy co2mandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfu2ly; help thou me. 
They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I fors2ok not thy precepts. 
Quicken me after thy lovingkindne2s; so sha2l I k2ep the testimony of thy mouth. 
For ever, O LORD, thy word is se2tled in heaven. 
Thy faithfulne2s is unto a2l generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth. 
They continue this day a2cording to thine ordinances: for a2l are thy servants. 
Unle2s thy law had b2en my delights, I should then have perished in mine a2fliction. 
I wi2l never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me. 
I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts. 
The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I wi2l consider thy testimonies. 
I have s2en an end of a2l perfection: but thy co2mandment is exc2eding broad. 
O how I love thy law! it is my meditation a2l the day. 
Thou through thy co2mandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me. 
I have more understanding than a2l my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation. 
I understand more than the ancients, because I k2ep thy precepts. 
I have refrained my f2et from every evil way, that I might k2ep thy word. 
I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me. 
How sw2et are thy words unto my taste! yea, sw2eter than honey to my mouth! 
Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way. 
Thy word is a lamp unto my f2et, and a light unto my path. 
I have sworn, and I wi2l perform it, that I wi2l k2ep thy righteous judgments. 
I am a2flicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, a2cording unto thy word. 
A2cept, I bes2ech th2e, the fr2ewi2l o2ferings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments. 
My soul is continua2ly in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law. 
The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I e2red not from thy precepts. 
Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart. 
I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end. 
I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love. 
Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word. 
Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I wi2l k2ep the co2mandments of my God. 
Uphold me a2cording unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope. 
Hold thou me up, and I sha2l be safe: and I wi2l have respect unto thy statutes continua2ly. 
Thou hast tro2den down a2l them that e2r from thy statutes: for their deceit is falseh2od. 
Thou pu2test away a2l the wicked of the earth like dro2s: therefore I love thy testimonies. 
My flesh trembleth for fear of th2e; and I am afraid of thy judgments. 
I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine o2pre2sors. 
Be surety for thy servant for g2od: let not the proud o2pre2s me. 
Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousne2s. 
Deal with thy servant a2cording unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes. 
I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies. 
It is time for th2e, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law. 
Therefore I love thy co2mandments above gold; yea, above fine gold. 
Therefore I est2em a2l thy precepts concerning a2l things to be right; and I hate every false way. 
Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul k2ep them. 
The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple. 
I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy co2mandments. 
L2ok thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name. 
Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me. 
Deliver me from the o2pre2sion of man: so wi2l I k2ep thy precepts. 
Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes. 
Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they k2ep not thy law. 
Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments. 
Thy testimonies that thou hast co2manded are righteous and very faithful. 
My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgo2ten thy words. 
Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it. 
I am sma2l and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts. 
Thy righteousne2s is an everlasting righteousne2s, and thy law is the truth. 
Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy co2mandments are my delights. 
The righteousne2s of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I sha2l live. 
I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I wi2l k2ep thy statutes. 
I cried unto th2e; save me, and I sha2l k2ep thy testimonies. 
I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word. 
Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word. 
Hear my voice a2cording unto thy lovingkindne2s: O LORD, quicken me a2cording to thy judgment. 
They draw nigh that fo2low after mischief: they are far from thy law. 
Thou art near, O LORD; and a2l thy co2mandments are truth. 
Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever. 
Consider mine a2fliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law. 
Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me a2cording to thy word. 
Salvation is far from the wicked: for they s2ek not thy statutes. 
Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me a2cording to thy judgments. 
Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline from thy testimonies. 
I beheld the transgre2sors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word. 
Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, a2cording to thy lovingkindne2s. 
Thy word is true from the begi2ning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever. 
Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word. 
I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil. 
I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love. 
Seven times a day do I praise th2e because of thy righteous judgments. 
Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing sha2l o2fend them. 
LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy co2mandments. 
My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exc2edingly. 
I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for a2l my ways are before th2e. 
Let my cry come near before th2e, O LORD: give me understanding a2cording to thy word. 
Let my su2plication come before th2e: deliver me a2cording to thy word. 
My lips sha2l u2ter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes. 
My tongue sha2l speak of thy word: for a2l thy co2mandments are righteousne2s. 
Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts. 
I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my delight. 
Let my soul live, and it sha2l praise th2e; and let thy judgments help me. 
I have gone astray like a lost sh2ep; s2ek thy servant; for I do not forget thy co2mandments. 
In my distre2s I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me. 
Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue. 
What sha2l be given unto th2e? or what sha2l be done unto th2e, thou false tongue? 
Sharp a2rows of the mighty, with coals of juniper. 
Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwe2l in the tents of Kedar! 
My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace. 
I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war. 
I wi2l lift up mine eyes unto the hi2ls, from whence cometh my help. 
My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth. 
He wi2l not su2fer thy f2ot to be moved: he that k2epeth th2e wi2l not slumber. 
Behold, he that k2epeth Israel sha2l neither slumber nor sl2ep. 
The LORD is thy k2eper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand. 
The sun sha2l not smite th2e by day, nor the m2on by night. 
The LORD sha2l preserve th2e from a2l evil: he sha2l preserve thy soul. 
The LORD sha2l preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore. 
I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD. 
Our f2et sha2l stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem. 
Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together: 
Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD. 
For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David. 
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they sha2l prosper that love th2e. 
Peace be within thy wa2ls, and prosperity within thy palaces. 
For my brethren and companions' sakes, I wi2l now say, Peace be within th2e. 
Because of the house of the LORD our God I wi2l s2ek thy g2od. 
Unto th2e lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwe2lest in the heavens. 
Behold, as the eyes of servants l2ok unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistre2s; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us. 
Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exc2edingly fi2led with contempt. 
Our soul is exc2edingly fi2led with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud. 
If it had not b2en the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say; 
If it had not b2en the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us: 
Then they had swa2lowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us: 
Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul: 
Then the proud waters had gone over our soul. 
Ble2sed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their t2eth. 
Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped. 
Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth. 
They that trust in the LORD sha2l be as mount Zion, which ca2not be removed, but abideth for ever. 
As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever. 
For the rod of the wicked sha2l not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity. 
Do g2od, O LORD, unto those that be g2od, and to them that are upright in their hearts. 
As for such as turn aside unto their cr2oked ways, the LORD sha2l lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace sha2l be upon Israel. 
When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. 
Then was our mouth fi2led with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them. 
The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad. 
Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south. 
They that sow in tears sha2l reap in joy. 
He that goeth forth and w2epeth, bearing precious s2ed, sha2l doubtle2s come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him. 
Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD k2ep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. 
It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of so2rows: for so he giveth his beloved sl2ep. 
Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. 
As a2rows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. 
Ha2py is the man that hath his quiver fu2l of them: they sha2l not be ashamed, but they sha2l speak with the enemies in the gate. 
Ble2sed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways. 
For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: ha2py shalt thou be, and it sha2l be we2l with th2e. 
Thy wife sha2l be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table. 
Behold, that thus sha2l the man be ble2sed that feareth the LORD. 
The LORD sha2l ble2s th2e out of Zion: and thou shalt s2e the g2od of Jerusalem a2l the days of thy life. 
Yea, thou shalt s2e thy children's children, and peace upon Israel. 
Many a time have they a2flicted me from my youth, may Israel now say: 
Many a time have they a2flicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me. 
The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their fu2rows. 
The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. 
Let them a2l be confounded and turned back that hate Zion. 
Let them be as the gra2s upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up: 
Wherewith the mower fi2leth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom. 
Neither do they which go by say, The ble2sing of the LORD be upon you: we ble2s you in the name of the LORD. 
Out of the depths have I cried unto th2e, O LORD. 
Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be a2tentive to the voice of my su2plications. 
If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who sha2l stand? 
But there is forgivene2s with th2e, that thou mayest be feared. 
I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. 
My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning. 
Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption. 
And he sha2l red2em Israel from a2l his iniquities. 
Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great ma2ters, or in things t2o high for me. 
Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child. 
Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever. 
Lord, remember David, and a2l his a2flictions: 
How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob; 
Surely I wi2l not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed; 
I wi2l not give sl2ep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, 
Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob. 
Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the w2od. 
We wi2l go into his tabernacles: we wi2l worship at his f2otst2ol. 
Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength. 
Let thy priests be clothed with righteousne2s; and let thy saints shout for joy. 
For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed. 
The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he wi2l not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body wi2l I set upon thy throne. 
If thy children wi2l k2ep my covenant and my testimony that I sha2l teach them, their children sha2l also sit upon thy throne for evermore. 
For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. 
This is my rest for ever: here wi2l I dwe2l; for I have desired it. 
I wi2l abundantly ble2s her provision: I wi2l satisfy her p2or with bread. 
I wi2l also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints sha2l shout aloud for joy. 
There wi2l I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed. 
His enemies wi2l I clothe with shame: but upon himself sha2l his crown flourish. 
Behold, how g2od and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwe2l together in unity! 
It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments; 
As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD co2manded the ble2sing, even life for evermore. 
Behold, ble2s ye the LORD, a2l ye servants of the LORD, which by night stand in the house of the LORD. 
Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and ble2s the LORD. 
The LORD that made heaven and earth ble2s th2e out of Zion. 
Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him, O ye servants of the LORD. 
Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God. 
Praise the LORD; for the LORD is g2od: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant. 
For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure. 
For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above a2l gods. 
Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and a2l d2ep places. 
He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries. 
Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast. 
Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of th2e, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon a2l his servants. 
Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings; 
Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and a2l the kingdoms of Can2an: 
And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people. 
Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout a2l generations. 
For the LORD wi2l judge his people, and he wi2l repent himself concerning his servants. 
The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 
They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they s2e not; 
They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths. 
They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them. 
Ble2s the LORD, O house of Israel: ble2s the LORD, O house of Aaron: 
Ble2s the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, ble2s the LORD. 
Ble2sed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwe2leth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD. 
O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is g2od: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
The m2on and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
And made Israel to pa2s through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
To him which led his people through the wilderne2s: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
And slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth for ever: 
And hath red2emed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
Who giveth f2od to a2l flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever. 
By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. 
We hanged our harps upon the wi2lows in the midst thereof. 
For there they that ca2ried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. 
How sha2l we sing the LORD's song in a strange land? 
If I forget th2e, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cu2ning. 
If I do not remember th2e, let my tongue cleave to the r2of of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy. 
Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof. 
O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; ha2py sha2l he be, that rewardeth th2e as thou hast served us. 
Ha2py sha2l he be, that taketh and dasheth thy li2tle ones against the stones. 
I wi2l praise th2e with my whole heart: before the gods wi2l I sing praise unto th2e. 
I wi2l worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindne2s and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above a2l thy name. 
In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul. 
A2l the kings of the earth sha2l praise th2e, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth. 
Yea, they sha2l sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the glory of the LORD. 
Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar o2f. 
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand sha2l save me. 
The LORD wi2l perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands. 
O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me. 
Thou knowest my downsi2ting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar o2f. 
Thou compa2sest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with a2l my ways. 
For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether. 
Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me. 
Such knowledge is t2o wonderful for me; it is high, I ca2not a2tain unto it. 
Whither sha2l I go from thy spirit? or whither sha2l I fl2e from thy presence? 
If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in he2l, behold, thou art there. 
If I take the wings of the morning, and dwe2l in the u2termost parts of the sea; 
Even there sha2l thy hand lead me, and thy right hand sha2l hold me. 
If I say, Surely the darkne2s sha2l cover me; even the night sha2l be light about me. 
Yea, the darkne2s hideth not from th2e; but the night shineth as the day: the darkne2s and the light are both alike to th2e. 
For thou hast po2se2sed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb. 
I wi2l praise th2e; for I am fearfu2ly and wonderfu2ly made: marve2lous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right we2l. 
My substance was not hid from th2e, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. 
Thine eyes did s2e my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy b2ok a2l my members were wri2ten, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them. 
How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! 
If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am sti2l with th2e. 
Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bl2ody men. 
For they speak against th2e wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain. 
Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate th2e? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against th2e? 
I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies. 
Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: 
And s2e if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting. 
Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man; 
Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continua2ly are they gathered together for war. 
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; a2ders' poison is under their lips. Selah. 
K2ep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings. 
The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah. 
I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my su2plications, O LORD. 
O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of ba2tle. 
Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah. 
As for the head of those that compa2s me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them. 
Let burning coals fa2l upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into d2ep pits, that they rise not up again. 
Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil sha2l hunt the violent man to overthrow him. 
I know that the LORD wi2l maintain the cause of the a2flicted, and the right of the p2or. 
Surely the righteous sha2l give thanks unto thy name: the upright sha2l dwe2l in thy presence. 
Lord, I cry unto th2e: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto th2e. 
Let my prayer be set forth before th2e as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. 
Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; k2ep the d2or of my lips. 
Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties. 
Let the righteous smite me; it sha2l be a kindne2s: and let him reprove me; it sha2l be an exce2lent oil, which sha2l not break my head: for yet my prayer also sha2l be in their calamities. 
When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they sha2l hear my words; for they are sw2et. 
Our bones are sca2tered at the grave's mouth, as when one cu2teth and cleaveth w2od upon the earth. 
But mine eyes are unto th2e, O GOD the Lord: in th2e is my trust; leave not my soul destitute. 
K2ep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity. 
Let the wicked fa2l into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape. 
I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my su2plication. 
I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble. 
When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me. 
I l2oked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. 
I cried unto th2e, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living. 
A2tend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. 
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous sha2l compa2s me about; for thou shalt deal bountifu2ly with me. 
Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my su2plications: in thy faithfulne2s answer me, and in thy righteousne2s. 
And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight sha2l no man living be justified. 
For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smi2ten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwe2l in darkne2s, as those that have b2en long dead. 
Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate. 
I remember the days of old; I meditate on a2l thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands. 
I stretch forth my hands unto th2e: my soul thirsteth after th2e, as a thirsty land. Selah. 
Hear me sp2edily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit. 
Cause me to hear thy lovingkindne2s in the morning; for in th2e do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto th2e. 
Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I fl2e unto th2e to hide me. 
Teach me to do thy wi2l; for thou art my God: thy spirit is g2od; lead me into the land of uprightne2s. 
Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousne2s' sake bring my soul out of trouble. 
And of thy mercy cut o2f mine enemies, and destroy a2l them that a2flict my soul: for I am thy servant. 
Ble2sed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight: 
My g2odne2s, and my fortre2s; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me. 
LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest a2count of him! 
Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that pa2seth away. 
Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they sha2l smoke. 
Cast forth lightning, and sca2ter them: sh2ot out thine a2rows, and destroy them. 
Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children; 
Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falseh2od. 
I wi2l sing a new song unto th2e, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings wi2l I sing praises unto th2e. 
It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword. 
Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falseh2od: 
That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace: 
That our garners may be fu2l, a2fording a2l ma2ner of store: that our sh2ep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our str2ets: 
That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our str2ets. 
Ha2py is that people, that is in such a case: yea, ha2py is that people, whose God is the LORD. 
I wi2l extol th2e, my God, O king; and I wi2l ble2s thy name for ever and ever. 
Every day wi2l I ble2s th2e; and I wi2l praise thy name for ever and ever. 
Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatne2s is unsearchable. 
One generation sha2l praise thy works to another, and sha2l declare thy mighty acts. 
I wi2l speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works. 
And men sha2l speak of the might of thy te2rible acts: and I wi2l declare thy greatne2s. 
They sha2l abundantly u2ter the memory of thy great g2odne2s, and sha2l sing of thy righteousne2s. 
The LORD is gracious, and fu2l of compa2sion; slow to anger, and of great mercy. 
The LORD is g2od to a2l: and his tender mercies are over a2l his works. 
A2l thy works sha2l praise th2e, O LORD; and thy saints sha2l ble2s th2e. 
They sha2l speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; 
To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom. 
Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout a2l generations. 
The LORD upholdeth a2l that fa2l, and raiseth up a2l those that be bowed down. 
The eyes of a2l wait upon th2e; and thou givest them their meat in due season. 
Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing. 
The LORD is righteous in a2l his ways, and holy in a2l his works. 
The LORD is nigh unto a2l them that ca2l upon him, to a2l that ca2l upon him in truth. 
He wi2l fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also wi2l hear their cry, and wi2l save them. 
The LORD preserveth a2l them that love him: but a2l the wicked wi2l he destroy. 
My mouth sha2l speak the praise of the LORD: and let a2l flesh ble2s his holy name for ever and ever. 
Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul. 
While I live wi2l I praise the LORD: I wi2l sing praises unto my God while I have any being. 
Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. 
His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish. 
Ha2py is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God: 
Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and a2l that therein is: which k2epeth truth for ever: 
Which executeth judgment for the o2pre2sed: which giveth f2od to the hungry. The LORD l2oseth the prisoners: 
The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous: 
The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherle2s and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down. 
The LORD sha2l reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto a2l generations. Praise ye the LORD. 
Praise ye the LORD: for it is g2od to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely. 
The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel. 
He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds. 
He te2leth the number of the stars; he ca2leth them a2l by their names. 
Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite. 
The LORD lifteth up the m2ek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground. 
Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God: 
Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh gra2s to grow upon the mountains. 
He giveth to the beast his f2od, and to the young ravens which cry. 
He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man. 
The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy. 
Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion. 
For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath ble2sed thy children within th2e. 
He maketh peace in thy borders, and fi2leth th2e with the finest of the wheat. 
He sendeth forth his co2mandment upon earth: his word ru2neth very swiftly. 
He giveth snow like w2ol: he sca2tereth the hoarfrost like ashes. 
He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold? 
He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow. 
He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel. 
He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD. 
Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens: praise him in the heights. 
Praise ye him, a2l his angels: praise ye him, a2l his hosts. 
Praise ye him, sun and m2on: praise him, a2l ye stars of light. 
Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens. 
Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he co2manded, and they were created. 
He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decr2e which sha2l not pa2s. 
Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and a2l d2eps: 
Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfi2ling his word: 
Mountains, and a2l hi2ls; fruitful tr2es, and a2l cedars: 
Beasts, and a2l ca2tle; cr2eping things, and flying fowl: 
Kings of the earth, and a2l people; princes, and a2l judges of the earth: 
Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children: 
Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is exce2lent; his glory is above the earth and heaven. 
He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of a2l his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD. 
Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise in the congregation of saints. 
Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. 
Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp. 
For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he wi2l beautify the m2ek with salvation. 
Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds. 
Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand; 
To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people; 
To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fe2ters of iron; 
To execute upon them the judgment wri2ten: this honour have a2l his saints. Praise ye the LORD. 
Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power. 
Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him a2cording to his exce2lent greatne2s. 
Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp. 
Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs. 
Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals. 
Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD. 
The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; 
To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; 
To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity; 
To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion. 
A wise man wi2l hear, and wi2l increase learning; and a man of understanding sha2l a2tain unto wise counsels: 
To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. 
The fear of the LORD is the begi2ning of knowledge: but f2ols despise wisdom and instruction. 
My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: 
For they sha2l be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. 
My son, if si2ners entice th2e, consent thou not. 
If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for bl2od, let us lurk privily for the i2nocent without cause: 
Let us swa2low them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit: 
We sha2l find a2l precious substance, we sha2l fi2l our houses with spoil: 
Cast in thy lot among us; let us a2l have one purse: 
My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy f2ot from their path: 
For their f2et run to evil, and make haste to shed bl2od. 
Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. 
And they lay wait for their own bl2od; they lurk privily for their own lives. 
So are the ways of every one that is gr2edy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. 
Wisdom crieth without; she u2tereth her voice in the str2ets: 
She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she u2tereth her words, saying, 
How long, ye simple ones, wi2l ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and f2ols hate knowledge? 
Turn you at my repr2of: behold, I wi2l pour out my spirit unto you, I wi2l make known my words unto you. 
Because I have ca2led, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; 
But ye have set at nought a2l my counsel, and would none of my repr2of: 
I also wi2l laugh at your calamity; I wi2l mock when your fear cometh; 
When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distre2s and anguish cometh upon you. 
Then sha2l they ca2l upon me, but I wi2l not answer; they sha2l s2ek me early, but they sha2l not find me: 
For that they hated knowledge, and did not ch2ose the fear of the LORD: 
They would none of my counsel: they despised a2l my repr2of. 
Therefore sha2l they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be fi2led with their own devices. 
For the turning away of the simple sha2l slay them, and the prosperity of f2ols sha2l destroy them. 
But whoso hearkeneth unto me sha2l dwe2l safely, and sha2l be quiet from fear of evil. 
My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my co2mandments with th2e; 
So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and a2ply thine heart to understanding; 
Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; 
If thou s2ekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; 
Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God. 
For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding. 
He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly. 
He k2epeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints. 
Then shalt thou understand righteousne2s, and judgment, and equity; yea, every g2od path. 
When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; 
Discretion sha2l preserve th2e, understanding sha2l k2ep th2e: 
To deliver th2e from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things; 
Who leave the paths of uprightne2s, to walk in the ways of darkne2s; 
Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardne2s of the wicked; 
Whose ways are cr2oked, and they froward in their paths: 
To deliver th2e from the strange woman, even from the stranger which fla2tereth with her words; 
Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forge2teth the covenant of her God. 
For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead. 
None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life. 
That thou mayest walk in the way of g2od men, and k2ep the paths of the righteous. 
For the upright sha2l dwe2l in the land, and the perfect sha2l remain in it. 
But the wicked sha2l be cut o2f from the earth, and the transgre2sors sha2l be r2oted out of it. 
My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart k2ep my co2mandments: 
For length of days, and long life, and peace, sha2l they a2d to th2e. 
Let not mercy and truth forsake th2e: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart: 
So shalt thou find favour and g2od understanding in the sight of God and man. 
Trust in the LORD with a2l thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. 
In a2l thy ways acknowledge him, and he sha2l direct thy paths. 
Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil. 
It sha2l be health to thy navel, and ma2row to thy bones. 
Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of a2l thine increase: 
So sha2l thy barns be fi2led with plenty, and thy pre2ses sha2l burst out with new wine. 
My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his co2rection: 
For whom the LORD loveth he co2recteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth. 
Ha2py is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that ge2teth understanding. 
For the merchandise of it is be2ter than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. 
She is more precious than rubies: and a2l the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. 
Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour. 
Her ways are ways of pleasantne2s, and a2l her paths are peace. 
She is a tr2e of life to them that lay hold upon her: and ha2py is every one that retaineth her. 
The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens. 
By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew. 
My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: k2ep sound wisdom and discretion: 
So sha2l they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck. 
Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy f2ot sha2l not stumble. 
When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sl2ep sha2l be sw2et. 
Be not afraid of su2den fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh. 
For the LORD sha2l be thy confidence, and sha2l k2ep thy f2ot from being taken. 
Wit2hold not g2od from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it. 
Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to mo2row I wi2l give; when thou hast it by th2e. 
Devise not evil against thy neighbour, s2eing he dwe2leth securely by th2e. 
Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done th2e no harm. 
Envy thou not the o2pre2sor, and ch2ose none of his ways. 
For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous. 
The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he ble2seth the habitation of the just. 
Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly. 
The wise sha2l inherit glory: but shame sha2l be the promotion of f2ols. 
Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and a2tend to know understanding. 
For I give you g2od doctrine, forsake ye not my law. 
For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. 
He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: k2ep my co2mandments, and live. 
Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth. 
Forsake her not, and she sha2l preserve th2e: love her, and she sha2l k2ep th2e. 
Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with a2l thy ge2ting get understanding. 
Exalt her, and she sha2l promote th2e: she sha2l bring th2e to honour, when thou dost embrace her. 
She sha2l give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory sha2l she deliver to th2e. 
Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life sha2l be many. 
I have taught th2e in the way of wisdom; I have led th2e in right paths. 
When thou goest, thy steps sha2l not be straitened; and when thou ru2nest, thou shalt not stumble. 
Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: k2ep her; for she is thy life. 
Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men. 
Avoid it, pa2s not by it, turn from it, and pa2s away. 
For they sl2ep not, except they have done mischief; and their sl2ep is taken away, unle2s they cause some to fa2l. 
For they eat the bread of wickedne2s, and drink the wine of violence. 
But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. 
The way of the wicked is as darkne2s: they know not at what they stumble. 
My son, a2tend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings. 
Let them not depart from thine eyes; k2ep them in the midst of thine heart. 
For they are life unto those that find them, and health to a2l their flesh. 
K2ep thy heart with a2l diligence; for out of it are the i2sues of life. 
Put away from th2e a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from th2e. 
Let thine eyes l2ok right on, and let thine eyelids l2ok straight before th2e. 
Ponder the path of thy f2et, and let a2l thy ways be established. 
Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy f2ot from evil. 
My son, a2tend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding: 
That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may k2ep knowledge. 
For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is sm2other than oil: 
But her end is bi2ter as wormw2od, sharp as a two-edged sword. 
Her f2et go down to death; her steps take hold on he2l. 
Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them. 
Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth. 
Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the d2or of her house: 
Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel: 
Lest strangers be fi2led with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger; 
And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, 
And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised repr2of; 
And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me! 
I was almost in a2l evil in the midst of the congregation and a2sembly. 
Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and ru2ning waters out of thine own we2l. 
Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the str2ets. 
Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with th2e. 
Let thy fountain be ble2sed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. 
Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy th2e at a2l times; and be thou ravished always with her love. 
And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? 
For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth a2l his goings. 
His own iniquities sha2l take the wicked himself, and he sha2l be holden with the cords of his sins. 
He sha2l die without instruction; and in the greatne2s of his fo2ly he sha2l go astray. 
My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, 
Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. 
Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend. 
Give not sl2ep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids. 
Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. 
Go to the ant, thou slu2gard; consider her ways, and be wise: 
Which having no guide, overs2er, or ruler, 
Provideth her meat in the su2mer, and gathereth her f2od in the harvest. 
How long wilt thou sl2ep, O slu2gard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sl2ep? 
Yet a li2tle sl2ep, a li2tle slumber, a li2tle folding of the hands to sl2ep: 
So sha2l thy poverty come as one that trave2leth, and thy want as an armed man. 
A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth. 
He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his f2et, he teacheth with his fingers; 
Frowardne2s is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continua2ly; he soweth discord. 
Therefore sha2l his calamity come su2denly; su2denly sha2l he be broken without remedy. 
These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him: 
A proud l2ok, a lying tongue, and hands that shed i2nocent bl2od, 
An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, f2et that be swift in ru2ning to mischief, 
A false witne2s that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren. 
My son, k2ep thy father's co2mandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother: 
Bind them continua2ly upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck. 
When thou goest, it sha2l lead th2e; when thou sl2epest, it sha2l k2ep th2e; and when thou awakest, it sha2l talk with th2e. 
For the co2mandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and repr2ofs of instruction are the way of life: 
To k2ep th2e from the evil woman, from the fla2tery of the tongue of a strange woman. 
Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take th2e with her eyelids. 
For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adultre2s wi2l hunt for the precious life. 
Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? 
Can one go upon hot coals, and his f2et not be burned? 
So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her sha2l not be i2nocent. 
Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry; 
But if he be found, he sha2l restore sevenfold; he sha2l give a2l the substance of his house. 
But whoso co2mi2teth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul. 
A wound and dishonour sha2l he get; and his reproach sha2l not be wiped away. 
For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he wi2l not spare in the day of vengeance. 
He wi2l not regard any ransom; neither wi2l he rest content, though thou givest many gifts. 
My son, k2ep my words, and lay up my co2mandments with th2e. 
K2ep my co2mandments, and live; and my law as the a2ple of thine eye. 
Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart. 
Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and ca2l understanding thy kinswoman: 
That they may k2ep th2e from the strange woman, from the stranger which fla2tereth with her words. 
For at the window of my house I l2oked through my casement, 
And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding, 
Pa2sing through the str2et near her corner; and he went the way to her house, 
In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night: 
And, behold, there met him a woman with the a2tire of an harlot, and subtil of heart. 
(She is loud and stu2born; her f2et abide not in her house: 
Now is she without, now in the str2ets, and lieth in wait at every corner.) 
So she caught him, and ki2sed him, and with an impudent face said unto him, 
I have peace o2ferings with me; this day have I payed my vows. 
Therefore came I forth to m2et th2e, diligently to s2ek thy face, and I have found th2e. 
I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt. 
I have perfumed my bed with my2rh, aloes, and ci2namon. 
Come, let us take our fi2l of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves. 
For the g2odman is not at home, he is gone a long journey: 
He hath taken a bag of money with him, and wi2l come home at the day a2pointed. 
With her much fair sp2ech she caused him to yield, with the fla2tering of her lips she forced him. 
He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a f2ol to the co2rection of the stocks; 
Ti2l a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life. 
Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and a2tend to the words of my mouth. 
Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths. 
For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have b2en slain by her. 
Her house is the way to he2l, going down to the chambers of death. 
Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? 
She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths. 
She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the d2ors. 
Unto you, O men, I ca2l; and my voice is to the sons of man. 
O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye f2ols, be ye of an understanding heart. 
Hear; for I wi2l speak of exce2lent things; and the opening of my lips sha2l be right things. 
For my mouth sha2l speak truth; and wickedne2s is an abomination to my lips. 
A2l the words of my mouth are in righteousne2s; there is nothing froward or perverse in them. 
They are a2l plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge. 
Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. 
For wisdom is be2ter than rubies; and a2l the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it. 
I wisdom dwe2l with prudence, and find out knowledge of wi2ty inventions. 
The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and a2rogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate. 
Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength. 
By me kings reign, and princes decr2e justice. 
By me princes rule, and nobles, even a2l the judges of the earth. 
I love them that love me; and those that s2ek me early sha2l find me. 
Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousne2s. 
My fruit is be2ter than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. 
I lead in the way of righteousne2s, in the midst of the paths of judgment: 
That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I wi2l fi2l their treasures. 
The LORD po2se2sed me in the begi2ning of his way, before his works of old. 
I was set up from everlasting, from the begi2ning, or ever the earth was. 
When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water. 
Before the mountains were se2tled, before the hi2ls was I brought forth: 
While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. 
When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compa2s upon the face of the depth: 
When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the d2ep: 
When he gave to the sea his decr2e, that the waters should not pa2s his co2mandment: when he a2pointed the foundations of the earth: 
Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; 
Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men. 
Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for ble2sed are they that k2ep my ways. 
Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. 
Ble2sed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my d2ors. 
For whoso findeth me findeth life, and sha2l obtain favour of the LORD. 
But he that si2neth against me wrongeth his own soul: a2l they that hate me love death. 
Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pi2lars: 
She hath ki2led her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table. 
She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city, 
Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, 
Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled. 
Forsake the f2olish, and live; and go in the way of understanding. 
He that reproveth a scorner ge2teth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man ge2teth himself a blot. 
Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate th2e: rebuke a wise man, and he wi2l love th2e. 
Give instruction to a wise man, and he wi2l be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he wi2l increase in learning. 
The fear of the LORD is the begi2ning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding. 
For by me thy days sha2l be multiplied, and the years of thy life sha2l be increased. 
If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it. 
A f2olish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing. 
For she si2teth at the d2or of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city, 
To ca2l pa2sengers who go right on their ways: 
Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, 
Stolen waters are sw2et, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant. 
But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of he2l. 
The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a f2olish son is the heavine2s of his mother. 
Treasures of wickedne2s profit nothing: but righteousne2s delivereth from death. 
The LORD wi2l not su2fer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked. 
He becometh p2or that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich. 
He that gathereth in su2mer is a wise son: but he that sl2epeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame. 
Ble2sings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. 
The memory of the just is ble2sed: but the name of the wicked sha2l rot. 
The wise in heart wi2l receive co2mandments: but a prating f2ol sha2l fa2l. 
He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways sha2l be known. 
He that winketh with the eye causeth so2row: but a prating f2ol sha2l fa2l. 
The mouth of a righteous man is a we2l of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. 
Hatred sti2reth up strifes: but love covereth a2l sins. 
In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding. 
Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the f2olish is near destruction. 
The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the p2or is their poverty. 
The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin. 
He is in the way of life that k2epeth instruction: but he that refuseth repr2of e2reth. 
He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that u2tereth a slander, is a f2ol. 
In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise. 
The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is li2tle worth. 
The lips of the righteous f2ed many: but f2ols die for want of wisdom. 
The ble2sing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he a2deth no so2row with it. 
It is as sport to a f2ol to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom. 
The fear of the wicked, it sha2l come upon him: but the desire of the righteous sha2l be granted. 
As the whirlwind pa2seth, so is the wicked no more: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation. 
As vinegar to the t2eth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the slu2gard to them that send him. 
The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked sha2l be shortened. 
The hope of the righteous sha2l be gladne2s: but the expectation of the wicked sha2l perish. 
The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but destruction sha2l be to the workers of iniquity. 
The righteous sha2l never be removed: but the wicked sha2l not inhabit the earth. 
The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue sha2l be cut out. 
The lips of the righteous know what is a2ceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardne2s. 
A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight is his delight. 
When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is wisdom. 
The integrity of the upright sha2l guide them: but the perversene2s of transgre2sors sha2l destroy them. 
Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousne2s delivereth from death. 
The righteousne2s of the perfect sha2l direct his way: but the wicked sha2l fa2l by his own wickedne2s. 
The righteousne2s of the upright sha2l deliver them: but transgre2sors sha2l be taken in their own naughtine2s. 
When a wicked man dieth, his expectation sha2l perish: and the hope of unjust men perisheth. 
The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead. 
An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge sha2l the just be delivered. 
When it goeth we2l with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, there is shouting. 
By the ble2sing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked. 
He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace. 
A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the ma2ter. 
Where no counsel is, the people fa2l: but in the multitude of counse2lors there is safety. 
He that is surety for a stranger sha2l smart for it: and he that hateth suretiship is sure. 
A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain riches. 
The merciful man doeth g2od to his own soul: but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh. 
The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousne2s sha2l be a sure reward.

The begi2ning of strife is as when one le2teth out water: therefore leave o2f contention, before it be me2dled with. 
He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD. 
Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a f2ol to get wisdom, s2eing he hath no heart to it?

A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment. 
Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a f2ol are in the ends of the earth. 
A f2olish son is a grief to his father, and bi2terne2s to her that bare him. 
Also to punish the just is not g2od, nor to strike princes for equity. 
He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an exce2lent spirit. 
Even a f2ol, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shu2teth his lips is est2emed a man of understanding. 
Through desire a man, having separated himself, s2eketh and interme2dleth with a2l wisdom. 
A f2ol hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself. 
When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach. 
The words of a man's mouth are as d2ep waters, and the we2lspring of wisdom as a flowing br2ok. 
It is not g2od to a2cept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment. 
A f2ol's lips enter into contention, and his mouth ca2leth for strokes. 
A f2ol's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul. 
The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the i2nermost parts of the be2ly. 
He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster. 
The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous ru2neth into it, and is safe. 
The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wa2l in his own conceit. 
Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility. 
He that answereth a ma2ter before he heareth it, it is fo2ly and shame unto him. 
The spirit of a man wi2l sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear? 
The heart of the prudent ge2teth knowledge; and the ear of the wise s2eketh knowledge.

He that is first in his own cause s2emeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him. 
The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth betw2en the mighty. 
A brother o2fended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle. 
A man's be2ly sha2l be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips sha2l he be fi2led. 
Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it sha2l eat the fruit thereof. 
Whoso findeth a wife findeth a g2od thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD. 
The p2or useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly. 
A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother. 
Be2ter is the p2or that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a f2ol. 
Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not g2od; and he that hasteth with his f2et si2neth. 
The f2olishne2s of man perverteth his way: and his heart fre2teth against the LORD. 
Wealth maketh many friends; but the p2or is separated from his neighbour. 
A false witne2s sha2l not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies sha2l not escape. 
Many wi2l intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts. 
A2l the brethren of the p2or do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him. 
He that ge2teth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that k2epeth understanding sha2l find g2od. 
A false witne2s sha2l not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies sha2l perish. 
Delight is not s2emly for a f2ol; much le2s for a servant to have rule over princes. 
The discretion of a man defe2reth his anger; and it is his glory to pa2s over a transgre2sion. 
The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the gra2s. 
A f2olish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dro2ping. 
House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD. 
Slothfulne2s casteth into a d2ep sl2ep; and an idle soul sha2l su2fer hunger. 
He that k2epeth the co2mandment k2epeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways sha2l die. 
He that hath pity upon the p2or lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given wi2l he pay him again. 
Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying. 
A man of great wrath sha2l su2fer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again. 
Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy la2ter end. 
There are many devices in a man's heart; neverthele2s the counsel of the LORD, that sha2l stand. 
The desire of a man is his kindne2s: and a p2or man is be2ter than a liar. 
The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it sha2l abide satisfied; he sha2l not be visited with evil. 
A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and wi2l not so much as bring it to his mouth again. 
Smite a scorner, and the simple wi2l beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he wi2l understand knowledge. 
He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach. 
Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to e2r from the words of knowledge. 
An ungodly witne2s scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity. 
Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of f2ols. 
Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise. 
The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso provoketh him to anger si2neth against his own soul. 
It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every f2ol wi2l be me2dling. 
The slu2gard wi2l not plow by reason of the cold; therefore sha2l he beg in harvest, and have nothing. 
Counsel in the heart of man is like d2ep water; but a man of understanding wi2l draw it out. 
Most men wi2l proclaim every one his own g2odne2s: but a faithful man who can find? 
The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are ble2sed after him. 
A king that si2teth in the throne of judgment sca2tereth away a2l evil with his eyes. 
Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? 
Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the LORD. 
Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right. 
The hearing ear, and the s2eing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them. 
Love not sl2ep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread. 
It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth. 
There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel. 
Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. 
Bread of deceit is sw2et to a man; but afterwards his mouth sha2l be fi2led with gravel. 
Every purpose is established by counsel: and with g2od advice make war. 
He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore me2dle not with him that fla2tereth with his lips. 
Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp sha2l be put out in obscure darkne2s. 
An inheritance may be go2ten hastily at the begi2ning; but the end thereof sha2l not be ble2sed. 
Say not thou, I wi2l recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and he sha2l save th2e. 
Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance is not g2od. 
Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way? 
It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make enquiry. 
A wise king sca2tereth the wicked, and bringeth the wh2el over them. 
The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching a2l the inward parts of the be2ly. 
Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy. 
The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the grey head. 
The bluene2s of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the inward parts of the be2ly. 
The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he wi2l. 
Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts. 
To do justice and judgment is more a2ceptable to the LORD than sacrifice. 
An high l2ok, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is sin. 
The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousne2s; but of every one that is hasty only to want. 
The ge2ting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity to2sed to and fro of them that s2ek death. 
The ro2bery of the wicked sha2l destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment. 
The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his work is right. 
It is be2ter to dwe2l in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house. 
The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes. 
When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge. 
The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedne2s. 
Whoso sto2peth his ears at the cry of the p2or, he also sha2l cry himself, but sha2l not be heard. 
A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath. 
It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction sha2l be to the workers of iniquity. 
The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding sha2l remain in the congregation of the dead. 
He that loveth pleasure sha2l be a p2or man: he that loveth wine and oil sha2l not be rich. 
The wicked sha2l be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgre2sor for the upright. 
It is be2ter to dwe2l in the wilderne2s, than with a contentious and an angry woman. 
There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwe2ling of the wise; but a f2olish man spendeth it up. 
He that fo2loweth after righteousne2s and mercy findeth life, righteousne2s, and honour. 
A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof. 
Whoso k2epeth his mouth and his tongue k2epeth his soul from troubles. 
Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath. 
The desire of the slothful ki2leth him; for his hands refuse to labour. 
He coveteth gr2edily a2l the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not. 
The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind? 
A false witne2s sha2l perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly. 
A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he directeth his way. 
There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD. 
The horse is prepared against the day of ba2tle: but safety is of the LORD. 
A G2OD name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold. 
The rich and p2or m2et together: the LORD is the maker of them a2l. 
A prudent man fores2eth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pa2s on, and are punished. 
By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour, and life. 
Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that doth k2ep his soul sha2l be far from them. 
Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he wi2l not depart from it. 
The rich ruleth over the p2or, and the bo2rower is servant to the lender. 
He that soweth iniquity sha2l reap vanity: and the rod of his anger sha2l fail. 
He that hath a bountiful eye sha2l be ble2sed; for he giveth of his bread to the p2or. 
Cast out the scorner, and contention sha2l go out; yea, strife and reproach sha2l cease. 
He that loveth purene2s of heart, for the grace of his lips the king sha2l be his friend. 
The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgre2sor. 
The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I sha2l be slain in the str2ets. 
The mouth of strange women is a d2ep pit: he that is abho2red of the LORD sha2l fa2l therein. 
F2olishne2s is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of co2rection sha2l drive it far from him. 
He that o2pre2seth the p2or to increase his riches, and he that giveth to the rich, sha2l surely come to want. 
Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and a2ply thine heart unto my knowledge. 
For it is a pleasant thing if thou k2ep them within th2e; they sha2l withal be fi2ted in thy lips. 
That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to th2e this day, even to th2e. 
Have not I wri2ten to th2e exce2lent things in counsels and knowledge, 
That I might make th2e know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto th2e? 
Rob not the p2or, because he is p2or: neither o2pre2s the a2flicted in the gate: 
For the LORD wi2l plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them. 
Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go: 
Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul. 
Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties for debts. 
If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under th2e? 
Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set. 
S2est thou a man diligent in his busine2s? he sha2l stand before kings; he sha2l not stand before mean men. 
When thou si2test to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before th2e: 
And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to a2petite. 
Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat. 
Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom. 
Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven. 
Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats: 
For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to th2e; but his heart is not with th2e. 
The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sw2et words. 
Speak not in the ears of a f2ol: for he wi2l despise the wisdom of thy words. 
Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherle2s: 
For their red2emer is mighty; he sha2l plead their cause with th2e. 
A2ply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge. 
Wit2hold not co2rection from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he sha2l not die. 
Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from he2l. 
My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart sha2l rejoice, even mine. 
Yea, my reins sha2l rejoice, when thy lips speak right things. 
Let not thine heart envy si2ners: but be thou in the fear of the LORD a2l the day long. 
For surely there is an end; and thine expectation sha2l not be cut o2f. 
Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way. 
Be not among winebi2bers; among riotous eaters of flesh: 
For the drunkard and the glu2ton sha2l come to poverty: and drowsine2s sha2l clothe a man with rags. 
Hearken unto thy father that begat th2e, and despise not thy mother when she is old. 
Buy the truth, and se2l it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding. 
The father of the righteous sha2l greatly rejoice: and he that bege2teth a wise child sha2l have joy of him. 
Thy father and thy mother sha2l be glad, and she that bare th2e sha2l rejoice. 
My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways. 
For a whore is a d2ep ditch; and a strange woman is a na2row pit. 
She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the transgre2sors among men. 
Who hath woe? who hath so2row? who hath contentions? who hath ba2bling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redne2s of eyes? 
They that ta2ry long at the wine; they that go to s2ek mixed wine. 
L2ok not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright. 
At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an a2der. 
Thine eyes sha2l behold strange women, and thine heart sha2l u2ter perverse things. 
Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast. 
They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when sha2l I awake? I wi2l s2ek it yet again. 
Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them. 
For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief. 
Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established: 
And by knowledge sha2l the chambers be fi2led with a2l precious and pleasant riches. 
A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength. 
For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counse2lors there is safety. 
Wisdom is t2o high for a f2ol: he openeth not his mouth in the gate. 
He that deviseth to do evil sha2l be ca2led a mischievous person. 
The thought of f2olishne2s is sin: and the scorner is an abomination to men. 
If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is sma2l. 
If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain; 
If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he that k2epeth thy soul, doth not he know it? and sha2l not he render to every man a2cording to his works? 
My son, eat thou honey, because it is g2od; and the honeycomb, which is sw2et to thy taste: 
So sha2l the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou hast found it, then there sha2l be a reward, and thy expectation sha2l not be cut o2f. 
Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwe2ling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place: 
For a just man fa2leth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked sha2l fa2l into mischief. 
Rejoice not when thine enemy fa2leth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth: 
Lest the LORD s2e it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him. 
Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious at the wicked: 
For there sha2l be no reward to the evil man; the candle of the wicked sha2l be put out. 
My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and me2dle not with them that are given to change: 
For their calamity sha2l rise su2denly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both? 
These things also belong to the wise. It is not g2od to have respect of persons in judgment. 
He that saith unto the wicked, Thou are righteous; him sha2l the people curse, nations sha2l abhor him: 
But to them that rebuke him sha2l be delight, and a g2od ble2sing sha2l come upon them. 
Every man sha2l ki2s his lips that giveth a right answer. 
Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house. 
Be not a witne2s against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive not with thy lips. 
Say not, I wi2l do so to him as he hath done to me: I wi2l render to the man a2cording to his work. 
I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; 
And, lo, it was a2l grown over with thorns, and ne2tles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wa2l thereof was broken down. 
Then I saw, and considered it we2l: I l2oked upon it, and received instruction. 
Yet a li2tle sl2ep, a li2tle slumber, a li2tle folding of the hands to sl2ep: 
So sha2l thy poverty come as one that trave2leth; and thy want as an armed man. 
These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out. 
It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a ma2ter. 
The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable. 
Take away the dro2s from the silver, and there sha2l come forth a ve2sel for the finer. 
Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne sha2l be established in righteousne2s. 
Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men: 
For be2ter it is that it be said unto th2e, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have s2en. 
Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put th2e to shame. 
Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another: 
Lest he that heareth it put th2e to shame, and thine infamy turn not away. 
A word fitly spoken is like a2ples of gold in pictures of silver. 
As an ea2ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. 
As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful me2senger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters. 
Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain. 
By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone. 
Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is su2ficient for th2e, lest thou be fi2led therewith, and vomit it. 
Withdraw thy f2ot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of th2e, and so hate th2e. 
A man that beareth false witne2s against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp a2row. 
Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken t2oth, and a f2ot out of joint. 
As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. 
If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: 
For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD sha2l reward th2e. 
The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue. 
It is be2ter to dwe2l in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house. 
As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is g2od news from a far country. 
A righteous man fa2ling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a co2rupt spring. 
It is not g2od to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory. 
He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without wa2ls. 
As snow in su2mer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not s2emly for a f2ol. 
As the bird by wandering, as the swa2low by flying, so the curse causele2s sha2l not come. 
A whip for the horse, a bridle for the a2s, and a rod for the f2ol's back. 
Answer not a f2ol a2cording to his fo2ly, lest thou also be like unto him. 
Answer a f2ol a2cording to his fo2ly, lest he be wise in his own conceit. 
He that sendeth a me2sage by the hand of a f2ol cu2teth o2f the f2et, and drinketh damage. 
The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of f2ols. 
As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a f2ol. 
As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouths of f2ols. 
The great God that formed a2l things both rewardeth the f2ol, and rewardeth transgre2sors. 
As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a f2ol returneth to his fo2ly. 
S2est thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a f2ol than of him. 
The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the str2ets. 
As the d2or turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed. 
The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth. 
The slu2gard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason. 
He that pa2seth by, and me2dleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears. 
As a mad man who casteth firebrands, a2rows, and death, 
So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport? 
Where no w2od is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth. 
As coals are to burning coals, and w2od to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife. 
The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the i2nermost parts of the be2ly. 
Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dro2s. 
He that hateth di2sembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him; 
When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart. 
Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedne2s sha2l be shewed before the whole congregation. 
Whoso di2geth a pit sha2l fa2l therein: and he that ro2leth a stone, it wi2l return upon him. 
A lying tongue hateth those that are a2flicted by it; and a fla2tering mouth worketh ruin. 
Boast not thyself of to mo2row; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. 
Let another man praise th2e, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips. 
A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a f2ol's wrath is heavier than them both. 
Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy? 
Open rebuke is be2ter than secret love. 
Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the ki2ses of an enemy are deceitful. 
The fu2l soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bi2ter thing is sw2et. 
As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place. 
Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sw2etne2s of a man's friend by hearty counsel. 
Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: for be2ter is a neighbour that is near than a brother far o2f. 
My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me. 
A prudent man fores2eth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pa2s on, and are punished. 
Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman. 
He that ble2seth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it sha2l be counted a curse to him. 
A continual dro2ping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike. 
Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself. 
Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. 
Whoso k2epeth the fig tr2e sha2l eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master sha2l be honoured. 
As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man. 
He2l and destruction are never fu2l; so the eyes of man are never satisfied. 
As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise. 
Though thou shouldest bray a f2ol in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet wi2l not his f2olishne2s depart from him. 
Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and l2ok we2l to thy herds. 
For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation? 
The hay a2peareth, and the tender gra2s sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered. 
The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field. 
And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy f2od, for the f2od of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens. 
The wicked fl2e when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion. 
For the transgre2sion of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof sha2l be prolonged. 
A p2or man that o2pre2seth the p2or is like a sw2eping rain which leaveth no f2od. 
They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as k2ep the law contend with them. 
Evil men understand not judgment: but they that s2ek the LORD understand a2l things. 
Be2ter is the p2or that walketh in his uprightne2s, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich. 
Whoso k2epeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father. 
He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he sha2l gather it for him that wi2l pity the p2or. 
He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer sha2l be abomination. 
Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he sha2l fa2l himself into his own pit: but the upright sha2l have g2od things in po2se2sion. 
The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the p2or that hath understanding searcheth him out. 
When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hi2den. 
He that covereth his sins sha2l not prosper: but whoso confe2seth and forsaketh them sha2l have mercy. 
Ha2py is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart sha2l fa2l into mischief. 
As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the p2or people. 
The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great o2pre2sor: but he that hateth covetousne2s sha2l prolong his days. 
A man that doeth violence to the bl2od of any person sha2l fl2e to the pit; let no man stay him. 
Whoso walketh uprightly sha2l be saved: but he that is perverse in his ways sha2l fa2l at once. 
He that ti2leth his land sha2l have plenty of bread: but he that fo2loweth after vain persons sha2l have poverty enough. 
A faithful man sha2l abound with ble2sings: but he that maketh haste to be rich sha2l not be i2nocent. 
To have respect of persons is not g2od: for for a piece of bread that man wi2l transgre2s. 
He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty sha2l come upon him. 
He that rebuketh a man afterwards sha2l find more favour than he that fla2tereth with the tongue. 
Whoso ro2beth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgre2sion; the same is the companion of a destroyer. 
He that is of a proud heart sti2reth up strife: but he that pu2teth his trust in the LORD sha2l be made fat. 
He that trusteth in his own heart is a f2ol: but whoso walketh wisely, he sha2l be delivered. 
He that giveth unto the p2or sha2l not lack: but he that hideth his eyes sha2l have many a curse. 
When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase. 
He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, sha2l su2denly be destroyed, and that without remedy. 
When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn. 
Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that k2epeth company with harlots spendeth his substance. 
The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it. 
A man that fla2tereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his f2et. 
In the transgre2sion of an evil man there is a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice. 
The righteous considereth the cause of the p2or: but the wicked regardeth not to know it. 
Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away wrath. 
If a wise man contendeth with a f2olish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest. 
The bl2odthirsty hate the upright: but the just s2ek his soul. 
A f2ol u2tereth a2l his mind: but a wise man k2epeth it in ti2l afterwards. 
If a ruler hearken to lies, a2l his servants are wicked. 
The p2or and the deceitful man m2et together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes. 
The king that faithfu2ly judgeth the p2or, his throne sha2l be established for ever. 
The rod and repr2of give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame. 
When the wicked are multiplied, transgre2sion increaseth: but the righteous sha2l s2e their fa2l. 
Co2rect thy son, and he sha2l give th2e rest; yea, he sha2l give delight unto thy soul. 
Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that k2epeth the law, ha2py is he. 
A servant wi2l not be co2rected by words: for though he understand he wi2l not answer. 
S2est thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a f2ol than of him. 
He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child sha2l have him become his son at the length. 
An angry man sti2reth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgre2sion. 
A man's pride sha2l bring him low: but honour sha2l uphold the humble in spirit. 
Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not. 
The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso pu2teth his trust in the LORD sha2l be safe. 
Many s2ek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh from the LORD. 
An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked. 
The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal, 
Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man. 
I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy. 
Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established a2l the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst te2l? 
Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. 
A2d thou not unto his words, lest he reprove th2e, and thou be found a liar. 
Two things have I required of th2e; deny me them not before I die: 
Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; f2ed me with f2od convenient for me: 
Lest I be fu2l, and deny th2e, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be p2or, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain. 
A2cuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse th2e, and thou be found guilty. 
There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not ble2s their mother. 
There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthine2s. 
There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up. 
There is a generation, whose t2eth are as swords, and their jaw t2eth as knives, to devour the p2or from o2f the earth, and the n2edy from among men. 
The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are thr2e things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough: 
The grave; and the ba2ren womb; the earth that is not fi2led with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough. 
The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the va2ley sha2l pick it out, and the young eagles sha2l eat it. 
There be thr2e things which are t2o wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not: 
The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid. 
Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedne2s. 
For thr2e things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it ca2not bear: 
For a servant when he reigneth; and a f2ol when he is fi2led with meat; 
For an odious woman when she is ma2ried; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistre2s. 
There be four things which are li2tle upon the earth, but they are exc2eding wise: 
The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the su2mer; 
The conies are but a f2eble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks; 
The locusts have no king, yet go they forth a2l of them by bands; 
The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces. 
There be thr2e things which go we2l, yea, four are comely in going: 
A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any; 
A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up. 
If thou hast done f2olishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth. 
Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth bu2ter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth bl2od: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife. 
The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him. 
What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows? 
Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings. 
It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink: 
Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the a2flicted. 
Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts. 
Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. 
Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of a2l such as are a2pointed to destruction. 
Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the p2or and n2edy. 
Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies. 
The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he sha2l have no n2ed of spoil. 
She wi2l do him g2od and not evil a2l the days of her life. 
She s2eketh w2ol, and flax, and worketh wi2lingly with her hands. 
She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her f2od from afar. 
She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens. 
She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. 
She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms. 
She perceiveth that her merchandise is g2od: her candle goeth not out by night. 
She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the dista2f. 
She stretcheth out her hand to the p2or; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the n2edy. 
She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for a2l her household are clothed with scarlet. 
She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple. 
Her husband is known in the gates, when he si2teth among the elders of the land. 
She maketh fine linen, and se2leth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant. 
Strength and honour are her clothing; and she sha2l rejoice in time to come. 
She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindne2s. 
She l2oketh we2l to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idlene2s. 
Her children arise up, and ca2l her ble2sed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. 
Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou exce2lest them a2l. 
Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she sha2l be praised. 
Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates. 
The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. 
Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; a2l is vanity. 
What profit hath a man of a2l his labour which he taketh under the sun? 
One generation pa2seth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. 
The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose. 
The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continua2ly, and the wind returneth again a2cording to his circuits. 
A2l the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not fu2l; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again. 
A2l things are fu2l of labour; man ca2not u2ter it: the eye is not satisfied with s2eing, nor the ear fi2led with hearing. 
The thing that hath b2en, it is that which sha2l be; and that which is done is that which sha2l be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. 
Is there any thing whereof it may be said, S2e, this is new? it hath b2en already of old time, which was before us. 
There is no remembrance of former things; neither sha2l there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that sha2l come after. 
I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
And I gave my heart to s2ek and search out by wisdom concerning a2l things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. 
I have s2en a2l the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, a2l is vanity and vexation of spirit. 
That which is cr2oked ca2not be made straight: and that which is wanting ca2not be numbered. 
I co2muned with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have go2ten more wisdom than a2l they that have b2en before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. 
And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madne2s and fo2ly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. 
For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth so2row. 
I said in mine heart, Go to now, I wi2l prove th2e with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity. 
I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it? 
I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on fo2ly, ti2l I might s2e what was that g2od for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven a2l the days of their life. 
I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: 
I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted tr2es in them of a2l kind of fruits: 
I made me p2ols of water, to water therewith the w2od that bringeth forth tr2es: 
I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great po2se2sions of great and sma2l ca2tle above a2l that were in Jerusalem before me: 
I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of a2l sorts. 
So I was great, and increased more than a2l that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. 
And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I wit2held not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in a2l my labour: and this was my portion of a2l my labour. 
Then I l2oked on a2l the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, a2l was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun. 
And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madne2s, and fo2ly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath b2en already done. 
Then I saw that wisdom exce2leth fo2ly, as far as light exce2leth darkne2s. 
The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the f2ol walketh in darkne2s: and I myself perceived also that one event ha2peneth to them a2l. 
Then said I in my heart, As it ha2peneth to the f2ol, so it ha2peneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity. 
For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the f2ol for ever; s2eing that which now is in the days to come sha2l a2l be forgo2ten. And how dieth the wise man? as the f2ol. 
Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for a2l is vanity and vexation of spirit. 
Yea, I hated a2l my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that sha2l be after me. 
And who knoweth whether he sha2l be a wise man or a f2ol? yet sha2l he have rule over a2l my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity. 
Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of a2l the labour which I t2ok under the sun. 
For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein sha2l he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil. 
For what hath man of a2l his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun? 
For a2l his days are so2rows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity. 
There is nothing be2ter for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy g2od in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God. 
For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I? 
For God giveth to a man that is g2od in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the si2ner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is g2od before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit. 
To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: 
A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; 
A time to ki2l, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; 
A time to w2ep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; 
A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; 
A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to k2ep, and a time to cast away; 
A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to k2ep silence, and a time to speak; 
A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace. 
What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth? 
I have s2en the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it. 
He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the begi2ning to the end. 
I know that there is no g2od in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do g2od in his life. 
And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the g2od of a2l his labour, it is the gift of God. 
I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it sha2l be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him. 
That which hath b2en is now; and that which is to be hath already b2en; and God requireth that which is past. 
And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedne2s was there; and the place of righteousne2s, that iniquity was there. 
I said in mine heart, God sha2l judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work. 
I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might s2e that they themselves are beasts. 
For that which befa2leth the sons of men befa2leth beasts; even one thing befa2leth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have a2l one breath; so that a man hath no pr2eminence above a beast: for a2l is vanity. 
A2l go unto one place; a2l are of the dust, and a2l turn to dust again. 
Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? 
Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing be2ter, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who sha2l bring him to s2e what sha2l be after him? 
So I returned, and considered a2l the o2pre2sions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were o2pre2sed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their o2pre2sors there was power; but they had no comforter. 
Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive. 
Yea, be2ter is he than both they, which hath not yet b2en, who hath not s2en the evil work that is done under the sun. 
Again, I considered a2l travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit. 
The f2ol foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. 
Be2ter is an handful with quietne2s, than both the hands fu2l with travail and vexation of spirit. 
Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun. 
There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of a2l his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of g2od? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail. 
Two are be2ter than one; because they have a g2od reward for their labour. 
For if they fa2l, the one wi2l lift up his fe2low: but woe to him that is alone when he fa2leth; for he hath not another to help him up. 
Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone? 
And if one prevail against him, two sha2l withstand him; and a thr2efold cord is not quickly broken. 
Be2ter is a p2or and a wise child than an old and f2olish king, who wi2l no more be admonished. 
For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh p2or. 
I considered a2l the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that sha2l stand up in his stead. 
There is no end of a2l the people, even of a2l that have b2en before them: they also that come after sha2l not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit. 
K2ep thy f2ot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of f2ols: for they consider not that they do evil. 
Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to u2ter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few. 
For a dream cometh through the multitude of busine2s; and a f2ol's voice is known by multitude of words. 
When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in f2ols: pay that which thou hast vowed. 
Be2ter is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. 
Su2fer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an e2ror: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands? 
For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but fear thou God. 
If thou s2est the o2pre2sion of the p2or, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the ma2ter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they. 
Moreover the profit of the earth is for a2l: the king himself is served by the field. 
He that loveth silver sha2l not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity. 
When g2ods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what g2od is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes? 
The sl2ep of a labouring man is sw2et, whether he eat li2tle or much: but the abundance of the rich wi2l not su2fer him to sl2ep. 
There is a sore evil which I have s2en under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. 
But those riches perish by evil travail: and he bege2teth a son, and there is nothing in his hand. 
As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked sha2l he return to go as he came, and sha2l take nothing of his labour, which he may ca2ry away in his hand. 
And this also is a sore evil, that in a2l points as he came, so sha2l he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind? 
A2l his days also he eateth in darkne2s, and he hath much so2row and wrath with his sickne2s. 
Behold that which I have s2en: it is g2od and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the g2od of a2l his labour that he taketh under the sun a2l the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his portion. 
Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God. 
For he sha2l not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart. 
There is an evil which I have s2en under the sun, and it is co2mon among men: 
A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of a2l that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease. 
If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not fi2led with g2od, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is be2ter than he. 
For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkne2s, and his name sha2l be covered with darkne2s. 
Moreover he hath not s2en the sun, nor known any thing: this hath more rest than the other. 
Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he s2en no g2od: do not a2l go to one place? 
A2l the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the a2petite is not fi2led. 
For what hath the wise more than the f2ol? what hath the p2or, that knoweth to walk before the living? 
Be2ter is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit. 
That which hath b2en is named already, and it is known that it is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he. 
S2eing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man the be2ter? 
For who knoweth what is g2od for man in this life, a2l the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can te2l a man what sha2l be after him under the sun? 
A g2od name is be2ter than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth. 
It is be2ter to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of a2l men; and the living wi2l lay it to his heart. 
So2row is be2ter than laughter: for by the sadne2s of the countenance the heart is made be2ter. 
The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of f2ols is in the house of mirth. 
It is be2ter to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of f2ols. 
For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the f2ol: this also is vanity. 
Surely o2pre2sion maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart. 
Be2ter is the end of a thing than the begi2ning thereof: and the patient in spirit is be2ter than the proud in spirit. 
Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of f2ols. 
Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were be2ter than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this. 
Wisdom is g2od with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that s2e the sun. 
For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the exce2lency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it. 
Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made cr2oked? 
In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him. 
A2l things have I s2en in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousne2s, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedne2s. 
Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself ? 
Be not over much wicked, neither be thou f2olish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? 
It is g2od that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God sha2l come forth of them a2l. 
Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city. 
For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth g2od, and si2neth not. 
Also take no h2ed unto a2l words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse th2e: 
For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others. 
A2l this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I wi2l be wise; but it was far from me. 
That which is far o2f, and exc2eding d2ep, who can find it out? 
I a2plied mine heart to know, and to search, and to s2ek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedne2s of fo2ly, even of f2olishne2s and madne2s: 
And I find more bi2ter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God sha2l escape from her; but the si2ner sha2l be taken by her. 
Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the a2count: 
Which yet my soul s2eketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among a2l those have I not found. 
Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions. 
Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldne2s of his face sha2l be changed. 
I counsel th2e to k2ep the king's co2mandment, and that in regard of the oath of God. 
Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. 
Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou? 
Whoso k2epeth the co2mandment sha2l f2el no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment. 
Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him. 
For he knoweth not that which sha2l be: for who can te2l him when it sha2l be? 
There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither sha2l wickedne2s deliver those that are given to it. 
A2l this have I s2en, and a2plied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt. 
And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgo2ten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity. 
Because sentence against an evil work is not executed sp2edily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fu2ly set in them to do evil. 
Though a si2ner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it sha2l be we2l with them that fear God, which fear before him: 
But it sha2l not be we2l with the wicked, neither sha2l he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God. 
There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it ha2peneth a2cording to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it ha2peneth a2cording to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity. 
Then I co2mended mirth, because a man hath no be2ter thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be me2ry: for that sha2l abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun. 
When I a2plied mine heart to know wisdom, and to s2e the busine2s that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night s2eth sl2ep with his eyes:) 
Then I beheld a2l the work of God, that a man ca2not find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to s2ek it out, yet he sha2l not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet sha2l he not be able to find it. 
For a2l this I considered in my heart even to declare a2l this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by a2l that is before them. 
A2l things come alike to a2l: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the g2od and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the g2od, so is the si2ner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath. 
This is an evil among a2l things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto a2l: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is fu2l of evil, and madne2s is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead. 
For to him that is joined to a2l the living there is hope: for a living dog is be2ter than a dead lion. 
For the living know that they sha2l die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgo2ten. 
Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun. 
Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a me2ry heart; for God now a2cepteth thy works. 
Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment. 
Live joyfu2ly with the wife whom thou lovest a2l the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given th2e under the sun, a2l the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun. 
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest. 
I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the ba2tle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of ski2l; but time and chance ha2peneth to them a2l. 
For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it fa2leth su2denly upon them. 
This wisdom have I s2en also under the sun, and it s2emed great unto me: 
There was a li2tle city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it: 
Now there was found in it a p2or wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same p2or man. 
Then said I, Wisdom is be2ter than strength: neverthele2s the p2or man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard. 
The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among f2ols. 
Wisdom is be2ter than weapons of war: but one si2ner destroyeth much g2od. 
Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a li2tle fo2ly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour. 
A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a f2ol's heart at his left. 
Yea also, when he that is a f2ol walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a f2ol. 
If the spirit of the ruler rise up against th2e, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great o2fences. 
There is an evil which I have s2en under the sun, as an e2ror which proc2edeth from the ruler: 
Fo2ly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place. 
I have s2en servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth. 
He that di2geth a pit sha2l fa2l into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent sha2l bite him. 
Whoso removeth stones sha2l be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth w2od sha2l be endangered thereby. 
If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct. 
Surely the serpent wi2l bite without enchantment; and a ba2bler is no be2ter. 
The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a f2ol wi2l swa2low up himself. 
The begi2ning of the words of his mouth is f2olishne2s: and the end of his talk is mischievous madne2s. 
A f2ol also is fu2l of words: a man ca2not te2l what sha2l be; and what sha2l be after him, who can te2l him? 
The labour of the f2olish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city. 
Woe to th2e, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning! 
Ble2sed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunke2ne2s! 
By much slothfulne2s the building decayeth; and through idlene2s of the hands the house dro2peth through. 
A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh me2ry: but money answereth a2l things. 
Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air sha2l ca2ry the voice, and that which hath wings sha2l te2l the ma2ter. 
Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days. 
Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil sha2l be upon the earth. 
If the clouds be fu2l of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tr2e fa2l toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tr2e fa2leth, there it sha2l be. 
He that observeth the wind sha2l not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds sha2l not reap. 
As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh a2l. 
In the morning sow thy s2ed, and in the evening wit2hold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether sha2l prosper, either this or that, or whether they both sha2l be alike g2od. 
Truly the light is sw2et, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun: 
But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them a2l; yet let him remember the days of darkne2s; for they sha2l be many. A2l that cometh is vanity. 
Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart ch2er th2e in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for a2l these things God wi2l bring th2e into judgment. 
Therefore remove so2row from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childh2od and youth are vanity. 
Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; 
While the sun, or the light, or the m2on, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain: 
In the day when the k2epers of the house sha2l tremble, and the strong men sha2l bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that l2ok out of the windows be darkened, 
And the d2ors sha2l be shut in the str2ets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he sha2l rise up at the voice of the bird, and a2l the daughters of musick sha2l be brought low; 
Also when they sha2l be afraid of that which is high, and fears sha2l be in the way, and the almond tr2e sha2l flourish, and the gra2sho2per sha2l be a burden, and desire sha2l fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the str2ets: 
Or ever the silver cord be l2osed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wh2el broken at the cistern. 
Then sha2l the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit sha2l return unto God who gave it. 
Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; a2l is vanity. 
And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he sti2l taught the people knowledge; yea, he gave g2od h2ed, and sought out, and set in order many proverbs. 
The preacher sought to find out a2ceptable words: and that which was wri2ten was upright, even words of truth. 
The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of a2semblies, which are given from one shepherd. 
And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many b2oks there is no end; and much study is a wearine2s of the flesh. 
Let us hear the conclusion of the whole ma2ter: Fear God, and k2ep his co2mandments: for this is the whole duty of man. 
For God sha2l bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be g2od, or whether it be evil. 
The song of songs, which is Solomon's. 
Let him ki2s me with the ki2ses of his mouth: for thy love is be2ter than wine. 
Because of the savour of thy g2od ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love th2e. 
Draw me, we wi2l run after th2e: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we wi2l be glad and rejoice in th2e, we wi2l remember thy love more than wine: the upright love th2e. 
I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon. 
L2ok not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath l2oked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the k2eper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept. 
Te2l me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou f2edest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at n2on: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions? 
If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the f2otsteps of the flock, and f2ed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents. 
I have compared th2e, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots. 
Thy ch2eks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of gold. 
We wi2l make th2e borders of gold with studs of silver. 
While the king si2teth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the sme2l thereof. 
A bundle of my2rh is my we2l-beloved unto me; he sha2l lie a2l night betwixt my breasts. 
My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi. 
Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes. 
Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is gr2en. 
The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir. 
I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the va2leys. 
As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. 
As the a2ple tr2e among the tr2es of the w2od, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sw2et to my taste. 
He brought me to the banqueting house, and his ba2ner over me was love. 
Stay me with flagons, comfort me with a2ples: for I am sick of love. 
His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me. 
I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, ti2l he please. 
The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, ski2ping upon the hi2ls. 
My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wa2l, he l2oketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the la2tice. 
My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. 
For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; 
The flowers a2pear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; 
The fig tr2e pu2teth forth her gr2en figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a g2od sme2l. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. 
O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me s2e thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sw2et is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely. 
Take us the foxes, the li2tle foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes. 
My beloved is mine, and I am his: he f2edeth among the lilies. 
Until the day break, and the shadows fl2e away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether. 
By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not. 
I wi2l rise now, and go about the city in the str2ets, and in the broad ways I wi2l s2ek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not. 
The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth? 
It was but a li2tle that I pa2sed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me. 
I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, ti2l he please. 
Who is this that cometh out of the wilderne2s like pi2lars of smoke, perfumed with my2rh and frankincense, with a2l powders of the merchant? 
Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; thr2escore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel. 
They a2l hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night. 
King Solomon made himself a chariot of the w2od of Lebanon. 
He made the pi2lars thereof of silver, the bo2tom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem. 
Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladne2s of his heart. 
Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that a2pear from mount Gilead. 
Thy t2eth are like a flock of sh2ep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is ba2ren among them. 
Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy sp2ech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks. 
Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, a2l shields of mighty men. 
Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which f2ed among the lilies. 
Until the day break, and the shadows fl2e away, I wi2l get me to the mountain of my2rh, and to the hi2l of frankincense. 
Thou art a2l fair, my love; there is no spot in th2e. 
Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: l2ok from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards. 
Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck. 
How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much be2ter is thy love than wine! and the sme2l of thine ointments than a2l spices! 
Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the sme2l of thy garments is like the sme2l of Lebanon. 
A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed. 
Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard, 
Spikenard and sa2fron; calamus and ci2namon, with a2l tr2es of frankincense; my2rh and aloes, with a2l the chief spices: 
A fountain of gardens, a we2l of living waters, and streams from Lebanon. 
Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits. 
I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my my2rh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved. 
I sl2ep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is fi2led with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night. 
I have put o2f my coat; how sha2l I put it on? I have washed my f2et; how sha2l I defile them? 
My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the d2or, and my bowels were moved for him. 
I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dro2ped with my2rh, and my fingers with sw2et sme2ling my2rh, upon the handles of the lock. 
I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I ca2led him, but he gave me no answer. 
The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the k2epers of the wa2ls t2ok away my veil from me. 
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye te2l him, that I am sick of love. 
What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us? 
My beloved is white and ru2dy, the chiefest among ten thousand. 
His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven. 
His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set. 
His ch2eks are as a bed of spices, as sw2et flowers: his lips like lilies, dro2ping sw2et sme2ling my2rh. 
His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his be2ly is as bright ivory overlaid with sa2phires. 
His legs are as pi2lars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, exce2lent as the cedars. 
His mouth is most sw2et: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem. 
Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may s2ek him with th2e. 
My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to f2ed in the gardens, and to gather lilies. 
I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he f2edeth among the lilies. 
Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, te2rible as an army with ba2ners. 
Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that a2pear from Gilead. 
Thy t2eth are as a flock of sh2ep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one ba2ren among them. 
As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks. 
There are thr2escore qu2ens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number. 
My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and ble2sed her; yea, the qu2ens and the concubines, and they praised her. 
Who is she that l2oketh forth as the morning, fair as the m2on, clear as the sun, and te2rible as an army with ba2ners? 
I went down into the garden of nuts to s2e the fruits of the va2ley, and to s2e whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates bu2ded. 
Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of A2minadib. 
Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may l2ok upon th2e. What wi2l ye s2e in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies. 
How beautiful are thy f2et with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cu2ning workman. 
Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy be2ly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies. 
Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins. 
Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishp2ols in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathra2bim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which l2oketh toward Damascus. 
Thine head upon th2e is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king is held in the ga2leries. 
How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! 
This thy stature is like to a palm tr2e, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes. 
I said, I wi2l go up to the palm tr2e, I wi2l take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts sha2l be as clusters of the vine, and the sme2l of thy nose like a2ples; 
And the r2of of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sw2etly, causing the lips of those that are asl2ep to speak. 
I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me. 
Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the vi2lages. 
Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us s2e if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape a2pear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there wi2l I give th2e my loves. 
The mandrakes give a sme2l, and at our gates are a2l ma2ner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for th2e, O my beloved. 
O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find th2e without, I would ki2s th2e; yea, I should not be despised. 
I would lead th2e, and bring th2e into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause th2e to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate. 
His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me. 
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please. 
Who is this that cometh up from the wilderne2s, leaning upon her beloved? I raised th2e up under the a2ple tr2e: there thy mother brought th2e forth: there she brought th2e forth that bare th2e. 
Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame. 
Many waters ca2not quench love, neither can the fl2ods drown it: if a man would give a2l the substance of his house for love, it would u2terly be contemned. 
We have a li2tle sister, and she hath no breasts: what sha2l we do for our sister in the day when she sha2l be spoken for? 
If she be a wa2l, we wi2l build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a d2or, we wi2l inclose her with boards of cedar. 
I am a wa2l, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour. 
Solomon had a vineyard at B2alhamon; he let out the vineyard unto k2epers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver. 
My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that k2ep the fruit thereof two hundred. 
Thou that dwe2lest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear it. 
Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices. 
The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of U2ziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. 
Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebe2led against me. 
The ox knoweth his owner, and the a2s his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider. 
Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a s2ed of evildoers, children that are co2rupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward. 
Why should ye be stricken any more? ye wi2l revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. 
From the sole of the f2ot even unto the head there is no soundne2s in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not b2en closed, neither bound up, neither mo2lified with ointment. 
Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers. 
And the daughter of Zion is left as a co2tage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city. 
Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very sma2l remnant, we should have b2en as Sodom, and we should have b2en like unto Gomo2rah. 
Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomo2rah. 
To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am fu2l of the burnt o2ferings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the bl2od of bu2locks, or of lambs, or of he goats. 
When ye come to a2pear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts? 
Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new m2ons and sa2baths, the ca2ling of a2semblies, I ca2not away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn m2eting. 
Your new m2ons and your a2pointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them. 
And when ye spread forth your hands, I wi2l hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I wi2l not hear: your hands are fu2l of bl2od. 
Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; 
Learn to do we2l; s2ek judgment, relieve the o2pre2sed, judge the fatherle2s, plead for the widow. 
Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they sha2l be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they sha2l be as w2ol. 
If ye be wi2ling and obedient, ye sha2l eat the g2od of the land: 
But if ye refuse and rebel, ye sha2l be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. 
How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was fu2l of judgment; righteousne2s lodged in it; but now murderers. 
Thy silver is become dro2s, thy wine mixed with water: 
Thy princes are rebe2lious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and fo2loweth after rewards: they judge not the fatherle2s, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them. 
Therefore saith the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I wi2l ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies: 
And I wi2l turn my hand upon th2e, and purely purge away thy dro2s, and take away a2l thy tin: 
And I wi2l restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counse2lors as at the begi2ning: afterward thou shalt be ca2led, The city of righteousne2s, the faithful city. 
Zion sha2l be red2emed with judgment, and her converts with righteousne2s. 
And the destruction of the transgre2sors and of the si2ners sha2l be together, and they that forsake the LORD sha2l be consumed. 
For they sha2l be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye sha2l be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen. 
For ye sha2l be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water. 
And the strong sha2l be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they sha2l both burn together, and none sha2l quench them. 
The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house sha2l be established in the top of the mountains, and sha2l be exalted above the hi2ls; and a2l nations sha2l flow unto it. 
And many people sha2l go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he wi2l teach us of his ways, and we wi2l walk in his paths: for out of Zion sha2l go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. 
And he sha2l judge among the nations, and sha2l rebuke many people: and they sha2l beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruningh2oks: nation sha2l not lift up sword against nation, neither sha2l they learn war any more. 
O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD. 
Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are s2othsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers. 
Their land also is fu2l of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also fu2l of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots: 
Their land also is fu2l of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made: 
And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not. 
Enter into the rock, and hide th2e in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty. 
The lofty l2oks of man sha2l be humbled, and the haughtine2s of men sha2l be bowed down, and the LORD alone sha2l be exalted in that day. 
For the day of the LORD of hosts sha2l be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he sha2l be brought low: 
And upon a2l the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon a2l the oaks of Bashan, 
And upon a2l the high mountains, and upon a2l the hi2ls that are lifted up, 
And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wa2l, 
And upon a2l the ships of Tarshish, and upon a2l pleasant pictures. 
And the loftine2s of man sha2l be bowed down, and the haughtine2s of men sha2l be made low: and the LORD alone sha2l be exalted in that day. 
And the idols he sha2l u2terly abolish. 
And they sha2l go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake te2ribly the earth. 
In that day a man sha2l cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats; 
To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ra2ged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake te2ribly the earth. 
Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be a2counted of ? 
For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the sta2f, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water. 
The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient, 
The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counse2lor, and the cu2ning artificer, and the eloquent orator. 
And I wi2l give children to be their princes, and babes sha2l rule over them. 
And the people sha2l be o2pre2sed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child sha2l behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable. 
When a man sha2l take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand: 
In that day sha2l he swear, saying, I wi2l not be an healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people. 
For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fa2len: because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory. 
The shew of their countenance doth witne2s against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves. 
Say ye to the righteous, that it sha2l be we2l with him: for they sha2l eat the fruit of their doings. 
Woe unto the wicked! it sha2l be i2l with him: for the reward of his hands sha2l be given him. 
As for my people, children are their o2pre2sors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead th2e cause th2e to e2r, and destroy the way of thy paths. 
The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people. 
The LORD wi2l enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the p2or is in your houses. 
What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the p2or? saith the Lord GOD of hosts. 
Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their f2et: 
Therefore the LORD wi2l smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD wi2l discover their secret parts. 
In that day the Lord wi2l take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their f2et, and their cauls, and their round tires like the m2on, 
The chains, and the bracelets, and the mu2flers, 
The bo2nets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the ea2rings, 
The rings, and nose jewels, 
The changeable suits of a2parel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins, 
The gla2ses, and the fine linen, and the h2ods, and the vails. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that instead of sw2et sme2l there sha2l be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of we2l set hair baldne2s; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty. 
Thy men sha2l fa2l by the sword, and thy mighty in the war. 
And her gates sha2l lament and mourn; and she being desolate sha2l sit upon the ground. 
And in that day seven women sha2l take hold of one man, saying, We wi2l eat our own bread, and wear our own a2parel: only let us be ca2led by thy name, to take away our reproach. 
In that day sha2l the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth sha2l be exce2lent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, sha2l be ca2led holy, even every one that is wri2ten among the living in Jerusalem: 
When the Lord sha2l have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and sha2l have purged the bl2od of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning. 
And the LORD wi2l create upon every dwe2ling place of mount Zion, and upon her a2semblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon a2l the glory sha2l be a defence. 
And there sha2l be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain. 
Now wi2l I sing to my we2lbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My we2lbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hi2l: 
And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepre2s therein: and he l2oked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes. 
And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard. 
What could have b2en done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I l2oked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? 
And now go to; I wi2l te2l you what I wi2l do to my vineyard: I wi2l take away the hedge thereof, and it sha2l be eaten up; and break down the wa2l thereof, and it sha2l be tro2den down: 
And I wi2l lay it waste: it sha2l not be pruned, nor di2ged; but there sha2l come up briers and thorns: I wi2l also co2mand the clouds that they rain no rain upon it. 
For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he l2oked for judgment, but behold o2pre2sion; for righteousne2s, but behold a cry. 
Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, ti2l there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth! 
In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses sha2l be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant. 
Yea, ten acres of vineyard sha2l yield one bath, and the s2ed of an homer sha2l yield an ephah. 
Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may fo2low strong drink; that continue until night, ti2l wine inflame them! 
And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands. 
Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst. 
Therefore he2l hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, sha2l descend into it. 
And the mean man sha2l be brought down, and the mighty man sha2l be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty sha2l be humbled: 
But the LORD of hosts sha2l be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy sha2l be sanctified in righteousne2s. 
Then sha2l the lambs f2ed after their ma2ner, and the waste places of the fat ones sha2l strangers eat. 
Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope: 
That say, Let him make sp2ed, and hasten his work, that we may s2e it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it! 
Woe unto them that ca2l evil g2od, and g2od evil; that put darkne2s for light, and light for darkne2s; that put bi2ter for sw2et, and sw2et for bi2ter! 
Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight! 
Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink: 
Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousne2s of the righteous from him! 
Therefore as the fire devoureth the stu2ble, and the flame consumeth the cha2f, so their r2ot sha2l be as ro2te2ne2s, and their blo2som sha2l go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel. 
Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smi2ten them: and the hi2ls did tremble, and their carcases were torn in the midst of the str2ets. For a2l this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out sti2l. 
And he wi2l lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and wi2l hi2s unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they sha2l come with sp2ed swiftly: 
None sha2l be weary nor stumble among them; none sha2l slumber nor sl2ep; neither sha2l the girdle of their loins be l2osed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken: 
Whose a2rows are sharp, and a2l their bows bent, their horses' h2ofs sha2l be counted like flint, and their wh2els like a whirlwind: 
Their roaring sha2l be like a lion, they sha2l roar like young lions: yea, they sha2l roar, and lay hold of the prey, and sha2l ca2ry it away safe, and none sha2l deliver it. 
And in that day they sha2l roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if one l2ok unto the land, behold darkne2s and so2row, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof. 
In the year that king U2ziah died I saw also the LORD si2ting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train fi2led the temple. 
Above it st2od the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his f2et, and with twain he did fly. 
And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is fu2l of his glory. 
And the posts of the d2or moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was fi2led with smoke. 
Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwe2l in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have s2en the King, the LORD of hosts. 
Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from o2f the altar: 
And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. 
Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom sha2l I send, and who wi2l go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me. 
And he said, Go, and te2l this people, Hear ye ind2ed, but understand not; and s2e ye ind2ed, but perceive not. 
Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they s2e with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed. 
Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be u2terly desolate, 
And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land. 
But yet in it sha2l be a tenth, and it sha2l return, and sha2l be eaten: as a teil tr2e, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy s2ed sha2l be the substance thereof. 
And it came to pa2s in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of U2ziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it. 
And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the tr2es of the w2od are moved with the wind. 
Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to m2et Ahaz, thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the u2per p2ol in the highway of the fu2ler's field; 
And say unto him, Take h2ed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. 
Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against th2e, saying, 
Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal: 
Thus saith the Lord GOD, It sha2l not stand, neither sha2l it come to pa2s. 
For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within thr2escore and five years sha2l Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people. 
And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye wi2l not believe, surely ye sha2l not be established. 
Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying, 
Ask th2e a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above. 
But Ahaz said, I wi2l not ask, neither wi2l I tempt the LORD. 
And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a sma2l thing for you to weary men, but wi2l ye weary my God also? 
Therefore the Lord himself sha2l give you a sign; Behold, a virgin sha2l conceive, and bear a son, and sha2l ca2l his name I2manuel. 
Bu2ter and honey sha2l he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and ch2ose the g2od. 
For before the child sha2l know to refuse the evil, and ch2ose the g2od, the land that thou abho2rest sha2l be forsaken of both her kings. 
The LORD sha2l bring upon th2e, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of A2syria. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, that the LORD sha2l hi2s for the fly that is in the u2termost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the b2e that is in the land of A2syria. 
And they sha2l come, and sha2l rest a2l of them in the desolate va2leys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon a2l thorns, and upon a2l bushes. 
In the same day sha2l the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of A2syria, the head, and the hair of the f2et: and it sha2l also consume the beard. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, that a man sha2l nourish a young cow, and two sh2ep; 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, for the abundance of milk that they sha2l give he sha2l eat bu2ter: for bu2ter and honey sha2l every one eat that is left in the land. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, that every place sha2l be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it sha2l even be for briers and thorns. 
With a2rows and with bows sha2l men come thither; because a2l the land sha2l become briers and thorns. 
And on a2l hi2ls that sha2l be di2ged with the ma2tock, there sha2l not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it sha2l be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of le2ser ca2tle. 
Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take th2e a great ro2l, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz. 
And I t2ok unto me faithful witne2ses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah. 
And I went unto the prophete2s; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then said the LORD to me, Ca2l his name Mahershalalhashbaz. 
For before the child sha2l have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria sha2l be taken away before the king of A2syria. 
The LORD spake also unto me again, saying, 
Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son; 
Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of A2syria, and a2l his glory: and he sha2l come up over a2l his cha2nels, and go over a2l his banks: 
And he sha2l pa2s through Judah; he sha2l overflow and go over, he sha2l reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings sha2l fi2l the breadth of thy land, O I2manuel. 
A2sociate yourselves, O ye people, and ye sha2l be broken in pieces; and give ear, a2l ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye sha2l be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye sha2l be broken in pieces. 
Take counsel together, and it sha2l come to nought; speak the word, and it sha2l not stand: for God is with us. 
For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying, 
Say ye not, A confederacy, to a2l them to whom this people sha2l say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. 
Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. 
And he sha2l be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of o2fence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
And many among them sha2l stumble, and fa2l, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken. 
Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. 
And I wi2l wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I wi2l l2ok for him. 
Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwe2leth in mount Zion. 
And when they sha2l say unto you, S2ek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that p2ep, and that mu2ter: should not a people s2ek unto their God? for the living to the dead? 
To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not a2cording to this word, it is because there is no light in them. 
And they sha2l pa2s through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it sha2l come to pa2s, that when they sha2l be hungry, they sha2l fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and l2ok upward. 
And they sha2l l2ok unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkne2s, dimne2s of anguish; and they sha2l be driven to darkne2s. 
Neverthele2s the dimne2s sha2l not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he lightly a2flicted the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously a2flict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galil2e of the nations. 
The people that walked in darkne2s have s2en a great light: they that dwe2l in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. 
Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy before th2e a2cording to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil. 
For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the sta2f of his shoulder, the rod of his o2pre2sor, as in the day of Midian. 
For every ba2tle of the wa2rior is with confused noise, and garments ro2led in bl2od; but this sha2l be with burning and fuel of fire. 
For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government sha2l be upon his shoulder: and his name sha2l be ca2led Wonderful, Counse2lor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. 
Of the increase of his government and peace there sha2l be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts wi2l perform this. 
The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel. 
And a2l the people sha2l know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutne2s of heart, 
The bricks are fa2len down, but we wi2l build with hewn stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we wi2l change them into cedars. 
Therefore the LORD sha2l set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together; 
The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they sha2l devour Israel with open mouth. For a2l this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out sti2l. 
For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they s2ek the LORD of hosts. 
Therefore the LORD wi2l cut o2f from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day. 
The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail. 
For the leaders of this people cause them to e2r; and they that are led of them are destroyed. 
Therefore the LORD sha2l have no joy in their young men, neither sha2l have mercy on their fatherle2s and widows: for every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh fo2ly. For a2l this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out sti2l. 
For wickedne2s burneth as the fire: it sha2l devour the briers and thorns, and sha2l kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they sha2l mount up like the lifting up of smoke. 
Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people sha2l be as the fuel of the fire: no man sha2l spare his brother. 
And he sha2l snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he sha2l eat on the left hand, and they sha2l not be satisfied: they sha2l eat every man the flesh of his own arm: 
Mana2seh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Mana2seh: and they together sha2l be against Judah. For a2l this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out sti2l. 
Woe unto them that decr2e unrighteous decr2es, and that write grievousne2s which they have prescribed; 
To turn aside the n2edy from judgment, and to take away the right from the p2or of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherle2s! 
And what wi2l ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which sha2l come from far? to whom wi2l ye fl2e for help? and where wi2l ye leave your glory? 
Without me they sha2l bow down under the prisoners, and they sha2l fa2l under the slain. For a2l this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out sti2l. 
O A2syrian, the rod of mine anger, and the sta2f in their hand is mine indignation. 
I wi2l send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath wi2l I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the str2ets. 
Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut o2f nations not a few. 
For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings? 
Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus? 
As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria; 
Sha2l I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols? 
Wherefore it sha2l come to pa2s, that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I wi2l punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of A2syria, and the glory of his high l2oks. 
For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have ro2bed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man: 
And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth e2gs that are left, have I gathered a2l the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or p2eped. 
Sha2l the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or sha2l the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the sta2f should lift up itself, as if it were no w2od. 
Therefore sha2l the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones lea2ne2s; and under his glory he sha2l kindle a burning like the burning of a fire. 
And the light of Israel sha2l be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it sha2l burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day; 
And sha2l consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they sha2l be as when a standard-bearer fainteth. 
And the rest of the tr2es of his forest sha2l be few, that a child may write them. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, sha2l no more again stay upon him that smote them; but sha2l stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth. 
The remnant sha2l return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God. 
For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them sha2l return: the consumption decr2ed sha2l overflow with righteousne2s. 
For the Lord GOD of hosts sha2l make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of a2l the land. 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwe2lest in Zion, be not afraid of the A2syrian: he sha2l smite th2e with a rod, and sha2l lift up his sta2f against th2e, after the ma2ner of Egypt. 
For yet a very li2tle while, and the indignation sha2l cease, and mine anger in their destruction. 
And the LORD of hosts sha2l stir up a scourge for him a2cording to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was upon the sea, so sha2l he lift it up after the ma2ner of Egypt. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, that his burden sha2l be taken away from o2f thy shoulder, and his yoke from o2f thy neck, and the yoke sha2l be destroyed because of the anointing. 
He is come to Aiath, he is pa2sed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his ca2riages: 
They are gone over the pa2sage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled. 
Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Ga2lim: cause it to be heard unto Laish, O p2or Anathoth. 
Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to fl2e. 
As yet sha2l he remain at Nob that day: he sha2l shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hi2l of Jerusalem. 
Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, sha2l lop the bough with te2ror: and the high ones of stature sha2l be hewn down, and the haughty sha2l be humbled. 
And he sha2l cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon sha2l fa2l by a mighty one. 
And there sha2l come forth a rod out of the stem of Je2se, and a Branch sha2l grow out of his r2ots: 
And the spirit of the LORD sha2l rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD; 
And sha2l make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD: and he sha2l not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears: 
But with righteousne2s sha2l he judge the p2or, and reprove with equity for the m2ek of the earth: and he sha2l smite the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips sha2l he slay the wicked. 
And righteousne2s sha2l be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulne2s the girdle of his reins. 
The wolf also sha2l dwe2l with the lamb, and the leopard sha2l lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a li2tle child sha2l lead them. 
And the cow and the bear sha2l f2ed; their young ones sha2l lie down together: and the lion sha2l eat straw like the ox. 
And the sucking child sha2l play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child sha2l put his hand on the cockatrice' den. 
They sha2l not hurt nor destroy in a2l my holy mountain: for the earth sha2l be fu2l of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea. 
And in that day there sha2l be a r2ot of Je2se, which sha2l stand for an ensign of the people; to it sha2l the Gentiles s2ek: and his rest sha2l be glorious. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, that the Lord sha2l set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which sha2l be left, from A2syria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea. 
And he sha2l set up an ensign for the nations, and sha2l a2semble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth. 
The envy also of Ephraim sha2l depart, and the adversaries of Judah sha2l be cut o2f: Ephraim sha2l not envy Judah, and Judah sha2l not vex Ephraim. 
But they sha2l fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; they sha2l spoil them of the east together: they sha2l lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of A2mon sha2l obey them. 
And the LORD sha2l u2terly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind sha2l he shake his hand over the river, and sha2l smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dryshod. 
And there sha2l be an highway for the remnant of his people, which sha2l be left, from A2syria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt. 
And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I wi2l praise th2e: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me. 
Behold, God is my salvation; I wi2l trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation. 
Therefore with joy sha2l ye draw water out of the we2ls of salvation. 
And in that day sha2l ye say, Praise the LORD, ca2l upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted. 
Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done exce2lent things: this is known in a2l the earth. 
Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of th2e. 
The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did s2e. 
Lift ye up a ba2ner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles. 
I have co2manded my sanctified ones, I have also ca2led my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highne2s. 
The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the ba2tle. 
They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land. 
Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it sha2l come as a destruction from the Almighty. 
Therefore sha2l a2l hands be faint, and every man's heart sha2l melt: 
And they sha2l be afraid: pangs and so2rows sha2l take hold of them; they sha2l be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they sha2l be amazed one at another; their faces sha2l be as flames. 
Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he sha2l destroy the si2ners thereof out of it. 
For the stars of heaven and the conste2lations thereof sha2l not give their light: the sun sha2l be darkened in his going forth, and the m2on sha2l not cause her light to shine. 
And I wi2l punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I wi2l cause the a2rogancy of the proud to cease, and wi2l lay low the haughtine2s of the te2rible. 
I wi2l make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir. 
Therefore I wi2l shake the heavens, and the earth sha2l remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger. 
And it sha2l be as the chased roe, and as a sh2ep that no man taketh up: they sha2l every man turn to his own people, and fl2e every one into his own land. 
Every one that is found sha2l be thrust through; and every one that is joined unto them sha2l fa2l by the sword. 
Their children also sha2l be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses sha2l be spoiled, and their wives ravished. 
Behold, I wi2l stir up the Medes against them, which sha2l not regard silver; and as for gold, they sha2l not delight in it. 
Their bows also sha2l dash the young men to pieces; and they sha2l have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eyes sha2l not spare children. 
And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chald2es' exce2lency, sha2l be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomo2rah. 
It sha2l never be inhabited, neither sha2l it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither sha2l the Arabian pitch tent there; neither sha2l the shepherds make their fold there. 
But wild beasts of the desert sha2l lie there; and their houses sha2l be fu2l of doleful creatures; and owls sha2l dwe2l there, and satyrs sha2l dance there. 
And the wild beasts of the islands sha2l cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days sha2l not be prolonged. 
For the LORD wi2l have mercy on Jacob, and wi2l yet ch2ose Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers sha2l be joined with them, and they sha2l cleave to the house of Jacob. 
And the people sha2l take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of Israel sha2l po2se2s them in the land of the LORD for servants and handmaids: and they sha2l take them captives, whose captives they were; and they sha2l rule over their o2pre2sors. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in the day that the LORD sha2l give th2e rest from thy so2row, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve, 
That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the o2pre2sor ceased! the golden city ceased! 
The LORD hath broken the sta2f of the wicked, and the sceptre of the rulers. 
He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth. 
The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing. 
Yea, the fir tr2es rejoice at th2e, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since thou art laid down, no fe2ler is come up against us. 
He2l from beneath is moved for th2e to m2et th2e at thy coming: it sti2reth up the dead for th2e, even a2l the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones a2l the kings of the nations. 
A2l they sha2l speak and say unto th2e, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us? 
Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under th2e, and the worms cover th2e. 
How art thou fa2len from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! 
For thou hast said in thine heart, I wi2l ascend into heaven, I wi2l exalt my throne above the stars of God: I wi2l sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: 
I wi2l ascend above the heights of the clouds; I wi2l be like the most High. 
Yet thou shalt be brought down to he2l, to the sides of the pit. 
They that s2e th2e sha2l na2rowly l2ok upon th2e, and consider th2e, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms; 
That made the world as a wilderne2s, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners? 
A2l the kings of the nations, even a2l of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house. 
But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase tro2den under f2et. 
Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the s2ed of evildoers sha2l never be renowned. 
Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor po2se2s the land, nor fi2l the face of the world with cities. 
For I wi2l rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut o2f from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD. 
I wi2l also make it a po2se2sion for the bi2tern, and p2ols of water: and I wi2l sw2ep it with the besom of destruction, saith the LORD of hosts. 
The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so sha2l it come to pa2s; and as I have purposed, so sha2l it stand: 
That I wi2l break the A2syrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under f2ot: then sha2l his yoke depart from o2f them, and his burden depart from o2f their shoulders. 
This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out upon a2l the nations. 
For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who sha2l disa2nul it? and his hand is stretched out, and who sha2l turn it back? 
In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden. 
Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote th2e is broken: for out of the serpent's r2ot sha2l come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit sha2l be a fiery flying serpent. 
And the firstborn of the p2or sha2l f2ed, and the n2edy sha2l lie down in safety: and I wi2l ki2l thy r2ot with famine, and he sha2l slay thy remnant. 
Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art di2solved: for there sha2l come from the north a smoke, and none sha2l be alone in his a2pointed times. 
What sha2l one then answer the me2sengers of the nation? That the LORD hath founded Zion, and the p2or of his people sha2l trust in it. 
The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence; 
He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to w2ep: Moab sha2l howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on a2l their heads sha2l be baldne2s, and every beard cut o2f. 
In their str2ets they sha2l gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their str2ets, every one sha2l howl, w2eping abundantly. 
And Heshbon sha2l cry, and Elealeh: their voice sha2l be heard even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab sha2l cry out; his life sha2l be grievous unto him. 
My heart sha2l cry out for Moab; his fugitives sha2l fl2e unto Zoar, an heifer of thr2e years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith with w2eping sha2l they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they sha2l raise up a cry of destruction. 
For the waters of Nimrim sha2l be desolate: for the hay is withered away, the gra2s faileth, there is no gr2en thing. 
Therefore the abundance they have go2ten, and that which they have laid up, sha2l they ca2ry away to the br2ok of the wi2lows. 
For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto B2erelim. 
For the waters of Dimon sha2l be fu2l of bl2od: for I wi2l bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land. 
Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderne2s, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion. 
For it sha2l be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, so the daughters of Moab sha2l be at the fords of Arnon. 
Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the n2onday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth. 
Let mine outcasts dwe2l with th2e, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the o2pre2sors are consumed out of the land. 
And in mercy sha2l the throne be established: and he sha2l sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and s2eking judgment, and hasting righteousne2s. 
We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his haughtine2s, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies sha2l not be so. 
Therefore sha2l Moab howl for Moab, every one sha2l howl: for the foundations of Kirhareseth sha2l ye mourn; surely they are stricken. 
For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come even unto Jazer, they wandered through the wilderne2s: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea. 
Therefore I wi2l bewail with the w2eping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I wi2l water th2e with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy su2mer fruits and for thy harvest is fa2len. 
And gladne2s is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there sha2l be no singing, neither sha2l there be shouting: the treaders sha2l tread out no wine in their pre2ses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease. 
Wherefore my bowels sha2l sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kirharesh. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, when it is s2en that Moab is weary on the high place, that he sha2l come to his sanctuary to pray; but he sha2l not prevail. 
This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that time. 
But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within thr2e years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab sha2l be contemned, with a2l that great multitude; and the remnant sha2l be very sma2l and f2eble. 
The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it sha2l be a ruinous heap. 
The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they sha2l be for flocks, which sha2l lie down, and none sha2l make them afraid. 
The fortre2s also sha2l cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they sha2l be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith the LORD of hosts. 
And in that day it sha2l come to pa2s, that the glory of Jacob sha2l be made thin, and the fatne2s of his flesh sha2l wax lean. 
And it sha2l be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and reapeth the ears with his arm; and it sha2l be as he that gathereth ears in the va2ley of Rephaim. 
Yet gleaning grapes sha2l be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tr2e, two or thr2e be2ries in the top of the u2permost bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, saith the LORD God of Israel. 
At that day sha2l a man l2ok to his Maker, and his eyes sha2l have respect to the Holy One of Israel. 
And he sha2l not l2ok to the altars, the work of his hands, neither sha2l respect that which his fingers have made, either the groves, or the images. 
In that day sha2l his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and an u2permost branch, which they left because of the children of Israel: and there sha2l be desolation. 
Because thou hast forgo2ten the God of thy salvation, and hast not b2en mindful of the rock of thy strength, therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it with strange slips: 
In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the morning shalt thou make thy s2ed to flourish: but the harvest sha2l be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate so2row. 
Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters! 
The nations sha2l rush like the rushing of many waters: but God sha2l rebuke them, and they sha2l fl2e far o2f, and sha2l be chased as the cha2f of the mountains before the wind, and like a ro2ling thing before the whirlwind. 
And behold at eveningtide trouble; and before the morning he is not. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot of them that rob us. 
Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia: 
That sendeth amba2sadors by the sea, even in ve2sels of bulrushes upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift me2sengers, to a nation sca2tered and p2eled, to a people te2rible from their begi2ning hitherto; a nation meted out and tro2den down, whose land the rivers have spoiled! 
A2l ye inhabitants of the world, and dwe2lers on the earth, s2e ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye. 
For so the LORD said unto me, I wi2l take my rest, and I wi2l consider in my dwe2ling place like a clear heat upon herbs, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest. 
For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he sha2l both cut o2f the sprigs with pruning h2oks, and take away and cut down the branches. 
They sha2l be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls sha2l su2mer upon them, and a2l the beasts of the earth sha2l winter upon them. 
In that time sha2l the present be brought unto the LORD of hosts of a people sca2tered and p2eled, and from a people te2rible from their begi2ning hitherto; a nation meted out and tro2den under f2ot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion. 
The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud, and sha2l come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt sha2l be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt sha2l melt in the midst of it. 
And I wi2l set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they sha2l fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom. 
And the spirit of Egypt sha2l fail in the midst thereof; and I wi2l destroy the counsel thereof: and they sha2l s2ek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards. 
And the Egyptians wi2l I give over into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king sha2l rule over them, saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts. 
And the waters sha2l fail from the sea, and the river sha2l be wasted and dried up. 
And they sha2l turn the rivers far away; and the br2oks of defence sha2l be emptied and dried up: the r2eds and flags sha2l wither. 
The paper r2eds by the br2oks, by the mouth of the br2oks, and every thing sown by the br2oks, sha2l wither, be driven away, and be no more. 
The fishers also sha2l mourn, and a2l they that cast angle into the br2oks sha2l lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters sha2l languish. 
Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave networks, sha2l be confounded. 
And they sha2l be broken in the purposes thereof, a2l that make sluices and ponds for fish. 
Surely the princes of Zoan are f2ols, the counsel of the wise counse2lors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings? 
Where are they? where are thy wise men? and let them te2l th2e now, and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt. 
The princes of Zoan are become f2ols, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof. 
The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof: and they have caused Egypt to e2r in every work thereof, as a drunken man sta2gereth in his vomit. 
Neither sha2l there be any work for Egypt, which the head or tail, branch or rush, may do. 
In that day sha2l Egypt be like unto women: and it sha2l be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which he shaketh over it. 
And the land of Judah sha2l be a te2ror unto Egypt, every one that maketh mention thereof sha2l be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he hath determined against it. 
In that day sha2l five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Can2an, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one sha2l be ca2led, The city of destruction. 
In that day sha2l there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pi2lar at the border thereof to the LORD. 
And it sha2l be for a sign and for a witne2s unto the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they sha2l cry unto the LORD because of the o2pre2sors, and he sha2l send them a saviour, and a great one, and he sha2l deliver them. 
And the LORD sha2l be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians sha2l know the LORD in that day, and sha2l do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they sha2l vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform it. 
And the LORD sha2l smite Egypt: he sha2l smite and heal it: and they sha2l return even to the LORD, and he sha2l be intreated of them, and sha2l heal them. 
In that day sha2l there be a highway out of Egypt to A2syria, and the A2syrian sha2l come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into A2syria, and the Egyptians sha2l serve with the A2syrians. 
In that day sha2l Israel be the third with Egypt and with A2syria, even a ble2sing in the midst of the land: 
Whom the LORD of hosts sha2l ble2s, saying, Ble2sed be Egypt my people, and A2syria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance. 
In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of A2syria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and t2ok it; 
At the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and l2ose the sackcloth from o2f thy loins, and put o2f thy shoe from thy f2ot. And he did so, walking naked and baref2ot. 
And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and baref2ot thr2e years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia; 
So sha2l the king of A2syria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and baref2ot, even with their bu2tocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. 
And they sha2l be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory. 
And the inhabitant of this isle sha2l say in that day, Behold, such is our expectation, whither we fl2e for help to be delivered from the king of A2syria: and how sha2l we escape? 
The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pa2s through; so it cometh from the desert, from a te2rible land. 
A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; a2l the sighing thereof have I made to cease. 
Therefore are my loins fi2led with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the s2eing of it. 
My heart panted, fearfulne2s a2frighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me. 
Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield. 
For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he s2eth. 
And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of a2ses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much h2ed: 
And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continua2ly upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights: 
And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fa2len, is fa2len; and a2l the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground. 
O my threshing, and the corn of my fl2or: that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you. 
The burden of Dumah. He ca2leth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night? 
The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye wi2l enquire, enquire ye: return, come. 
The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia sha2l ye lodge, O ye trave2ling companies of Dedanim. 
The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled. 
For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousne2s of war. 
For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Within a year, a2cording to the years of an hireling, and a2l the glory of Kedar sha2l fail: 
And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, sha2l be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken it. 
The burden of the va2ley of vision. What aileth th2e now, that thou art who2ly gone up to the housetops? 
Thou that art fu2l of stirs, a tumultuous city, joyous city: thy slain men are not slain with the sword, nor dead in ba2tle. 
A2l thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the archers: a2l that are found in th2e are bound together, which have fled from far. 
Therefore said I, L2ok away from me; I wi2l w2ep bi2terly, labour not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people. 
For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the va2ley of vision, breaking down the wa2ls, and of crying to the mountains. 
And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that thy choicest va2leys sha2l be fu2l of chariots, and the horsemen sha2l set themselves in a2ray at the gate. 
And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst l2ok in that day to the armour of the house of the forest. 
Ye have s2en also the breaches of the city of David, that they are many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower p2ol. 
And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wa2l. 
Ye made also a ditch betw2en the two wa2ls for the water of the old p2ol: but ye have not l2oked unto the maker thereof, neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago. 
And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts ca2l to w2eping, and to mourning, and to baldne2s, and to girding with sackcloth: 
And behold joy and gladne2s, slaying oxen, and ki2ling sh2ep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to mo2row we sha2l die. 
And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely this iniquity sha2l not be purged from you ti2l ye die, saith the Lord GOD of hosts. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get th2e unto this treasurer, even unto Shebna, which is over the house, and say, 
What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed th2e out a sepulchre here, as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high, and that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock? 
Behold, the LORD wi2l ca2ry th2e away with a mighty captivity, and wi2l surely cover th2e. 
He wi2l surely violently turn and to2s th2e like a ba2l into a large country: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy glory sha2l be the shame of thy lord's house. 
And I wi2l drive th2e from thy station, and from thy state sha2l he pu2l th2e down. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, that I wi2l ca2l my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah: 
And I wi2l clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I wi2l co2mit thy government into his hand: and he sha2l be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah. 
And the key of the house of David wi2l I lay upon his shoulder; so he sha2l open, and none sha2l shut; and he sha2l shut, and none sha2l open. 
And I wi2l fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he sha2l be for a glorious throne to his father's house. 
And they sha2l hang upon him a2l the glory of his father's house, the o2fspring and the i2sue, a2l ve2sels of sma2l quantity, from the ve2sels of cups, even to a2l the ve2sels of flagons. 
In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, sha2l the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fa2l; and the burden that was upon it sha2l be cut o2f: for the LORD hath spoken it. 
The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Chi2tim it is revealed to them. 
Be sti2l, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pa2s over the sea, have replenished. 
And by great waters the s2ed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations. 
Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins. 
As at the report concerning Egypt, so sha2l they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre. 
Pa2s ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle. 
Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? her own f2et sha2l ca2ry her afar o2f to sojourn. 
Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose tra2fickers are the honourable of the earth? 
The LORD of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of a2l glory, and to bring into contempt a2l the honourable of the earth. 
Pa2s through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: there is no more strength. 
He stretched out his hand over the sea, he sh2ok the kingdoms: the LORD hath given a co2mandment against the merchant city, to destroy the strong holds thereof. 
And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou o2pre2sed virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pa2s over to Chi2tim; there also shalt thou have no rest. 
Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, ti2l the A2syrian founded it for them that dwe2l in the wilderne2s: they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof; and he brought it to ruin. 
Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, that Tyre sha2l be forgo2ten seventy years, a2cording to the days of one king: after the end of seventy years sha2l Tyre sing as an harlot. 
Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast b2en forgo2ten; make sw2et melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s after the end of seventy years, that the LORD wi2l visit Tyre, and she sha2l turn to her hire, and sha2l co2mit fornication with a2l the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth. 
And her merchandise and her hire sha2l be holine2s to the LORD: it sha2l not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise sha2l be for them that dwe2l before the LORD, to eat su2ficiently, and for durable clothing. 
Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and sca2tereth abroad the inhabitants thereof. 
And it sha2l be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistre2s; as with the buyer, so with the se2ler; as with the lender, so with the bo2rower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him. 
The land sha2l be u2terly emptied, and u2terly spoiled: for the LORD hath spoken this word. 
The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish. 
The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgre2sed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. 
Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwe2l therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left. 
The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, a2l the me2ryhearted do sigh. 
The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth. 
They sha2l not drink wine with a song; strong drink sha2l be bi2ter to them that drink it. 
The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in. 
There is a crying for wine in the str2ets; a2l joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone. 
In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smi2ten with destruction. 
When thus it sha2l be in the midst of the land among the people, there sha2l be as the shaking of an olive tr2e, and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done. 
They sha2l lift up their voice, they sha2l sing for the majesty of the LORD, they sha2l cry aloud from the sea. 
Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea. 
From the u2termost part of the earth have we heard songs, even glory to the righteous. But I said, My lea2ne2s, my lea2ne2s, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously. 
Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon th2e, O inhabitant of the earth. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that he who fl2eth from the noise of the fear sha2l fa2l into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit sha2l be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake. 
The earth is u2terly broken down, the earth is clean di2solved, the earth is moved exc2edingly. 
The earth sha2l r2el to and fro like a drunkard, and sha2l be removed like a co2tage; and the transgre2sion thereof sha2l be heavy upon it; and it sha2l fa2l, and not rise again. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, that the LORD sha2l punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth. 
And they sha2l be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and sha2l be shut up in the prison, and after many days sha2l they be visited. 
Then the m2on sha2l be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts sha2l reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously. 
O Lord, thou art my God; I wi2l exalt th2e, I wi2l praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are faithfulne2s and truth. 
For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it sha2l never be built. 
Therefore sha2l the strong people glorify th2e, the city of the te2rible nations sha2l fear th2e. 
For thou hast b2en a strength to the p2or, a strength to the n2edy in his distre2s, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the te2rible ones is as a storm against the wa2l. 
Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the te2rible ones sha2l be brought low. 
And in this mountain sha2l the LORD of hosts make unto a2l people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the l2es, of fat things fu2l of ma2row, of wines on the l2es we2l refined. 
And he wi2l destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over a2l people, and the vail that is spread over a2l nations. 
He wi2l swa2low up death in victory; and the Lord GOD wi2l wipe away tears from o2f a2l faces; and the rebuke of his people sha2l he take away from o2f a2l the earth: for the LORD hath spoken it. 
And it sha2l be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he wi2l save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him, we wi2l be glad and rejoice in his salvation. 
For in this mountain sha2l the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab sha2l be tro2den down under him, even as straw is tro2den down for the dunghi2l. 
And he sha2l spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swi2meth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he sha2l bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands. 
And the fortre2s of the high fort of thy wa2ls sha2l he bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust. 
In that day sha2l this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation wi2l God a2point for wa2ls and bulwarks. 
Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which k2epeth the truth may enter in. 
Thou wilt k2ep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on th2e: because he trusteth in th2e. 
Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strength: 
For he bringeth down them that dwe2l on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust. 
The f2ot sha2l tread it down, even the f2et of the p2or, and the steps of the n2edy. 
The way of the just is uprightne2s: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just. 
Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for th2e; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of th2e. 
With my soul have I desired th2e in the night; yea, with my spirit within me wi2l I s2ek th2e early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world wi2l learn righteousne2s. 
Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet wi2l he not learn righteousne2s: in the land of uprightne2s wi2l he deal unjustly, and wi2l not behold the majesty of the LORD. 
LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they wi2l not s2e: but they sha2l s2e, and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine enemies sha2l devour them. 
LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought a2l our works in us. 
O LORD our God, other lords beside th2e have had dominion over us: but by th2e only wi2l we make mention of thy name. 
They are dead, they sha2l not live; they are deceased, they sha2l not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made a2l their memory to perish. 
Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed it far unto a2l the ends of the earth. 
LORD, in trouble have they visited th2e, they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them. 
Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we b2en in thy sight, O LORD. 
We have b2en with child, we have b2en in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fa2len. 
Thy dead men sha2l live, together with my dead body sha2l they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwe2l in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth sha2l cast out the dead. 
Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy d2ors about th2e: hide thyself as it were for a li2tle moment, until the indignation be overpast. 
For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also sha2l disclose her bl2od, and sha2l no more cover her slain. 
In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword sha2l punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that cr2oked serpent; and he sha2l slay the dragon that is in the sea. 
In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine. 
I the LORD do k2ep it; I wi2l water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I wi2l k2ep it night and day. 
Fury is not in me: who would set the briers and thorns against me in ba2tle? I would go through them, I would burn them together. 
Or let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he sha2l make peace with me. 
He sha2l cause them that come of Jacob to take r2ot: Israel sha2l blo2som and bud, and fi2l the face of the world with fruit. 
Hath he smi2ten him, as he smote those that smote him? or is he slain a2cording to the slaughter of them that are slain by him? 
In measure, when it sh2oteth forth, thou wilt debate with it: he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind. 
By this therefore sha2l the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is a2l the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh a2l the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images sha2l not stand up. 
Yet the defenced city sha2l be desolate, and the habitation forsaken, and left like a wilderne2s: there sha2l the calf f2ed, and there sha2l he lie down, and consume the branches thereof. 
When the boughs thereof are withered, they sha2l be broken o2f: the women come, and set them on fire: for it is a people of no understanding: therefore he that made them wi2l not have mercy on them, and he that formed them wi2l shew them no favour. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, that the LORD sha2l beat o2f from the cha2nel of the river unto the stream of Egypt, and ye sha2l be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, that the great trumpet sha2l be blown, and they sha2l come which were ready to perish in the land of A2syria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and sha2l worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem. 
Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat va2leys of them that are overcome with wine! 
Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a fl2od of mighty waters overflowing, sha2l cast down to the earth with the hand. 
The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, sha2l be tro2den under f2et: 
And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat va2ley, sha2l be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the su2mer; which when he that l2oketh upon it s2eth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up. 
In that day sha2l the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people, 
And for a spirit of judgment to him that si2teth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the ba2tle to the gate. 
But they also have e2red through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have e2red through strong drink, they are swa2lowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they e2r in vision, they stumble in judgment. 
For a2l tables are fu2l of vomit and filthine2s, so that there is no place clean. 
Whom sha2l he teach knowledge? and whom sha2l he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts. 
For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a li2tle, and there a li2tle: 
For with sta2mering lips and another tongue wi2l he speak to this people. 
To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear. 
But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a li2tle, and there a li2tle; that they might go, and fa2l backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken. 
Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem. 
Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with he2l are we at agr2ement; when the overflowing scourge sha2l pa2s through, it sha2l not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falseh2od have we hid ourselves: 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth sha2l not make haste. 
Judgment also wi2l I lay to the line, and righteousne2s to the plu2met: and the hail sha2l sw2ep away the refuge of lies, and the waters sha2l overflow the hiding place. 
And your covenant with death sha2l be disa2nu2led, and your agr2ement with he2l sha2l not stand; when the overflowing scourge sha2l pa2s through, then ye sha2l be tro2den down by it. 
From the time that it goeth forth it sha2l take you: for morning by morning sha2l it pa2s over, by day and by night: and it sha2l be a vexation only to understand the report. 
For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering na2rower than that he can wrap himself in it. 
For the LORD sha2l rise up as in mount Perazim, he sha2l be wroth as in the va2ley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pa2s his act, his strange act. 
Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth. 
Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my sp2ech. 
Doth the plowman plow a2l day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground? 
When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and sca2ter the cu2min, and cast in the principal wheat and the a2pointed barley and the rie in their place? 
For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him. 
For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wh2el turned about upon the cu2min; but the fitches are beaten out with a sta2f, and the cu2min with a rod. 
Bread corn is bruised; because he wi2l not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wh2el of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen. 
This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, which is wonderful in counsel, and exce2lent in working. 
Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! a2d ye year to year; let them ki2l sacrifices. 
Yet I wi2l distre2s Ariel, and there sha2l be heavine2s and so2row: and it sha2l be unto me as Ariel. 
And I wi2l camp against th2e round about, and wi2l lay siege against th2e with a mount, and I wi2l raise forts against th2e. 
And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy sp2ech sha2l be low out of the dust, and thy voice sha2l be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy sp2ech sha2l whisper out of the dust. 
Moreover the multitude of thy strangers sha2l be like sma2l dust, and the multitude of the te2rible ones sha2l be as cha2f that pa2seth away: yea, it sha2l be at an instant su2denly. 
Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire. 
And the multitude of a2l the nations that fight against Ariel, even a2l that fight against her and her munition, and that distre2s her, sha2l be as a dream of a night vision. 
It sha2l even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath a2petite: so sha2l the multitude of a2l the nations be, that fight against mount Zion. 
Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they sta2ger, but not with strong drink. 
For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of d2ep sl2ep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the s2ers hath he covered. 
And the vision of a2l is become unto you as the words of a b2ok that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray th2e: and he saith, I ca2not; for it is sealed: 
And the b2ok is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray th2e: and he saith, I am not learned. 
Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men: 
Therefore, behold, I wi2l proc2ed to do a marve2lous work among this people, even a marve2lous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men sha2l perish, and the understanding of their prudent men sha2l be hid. 
Woe unto them that s2ek d2ep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who s2eth us? and who knoweth us? 
Surely your turning of things upside down sha2l be est2emed as the po2ter's clay: for sha2l the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or sha2l the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding? 
Is it not yet a very li2tle while, and Lebanon sha2l be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field sha2l be est2emed as a forest? 
And in that day sha2l the deaf hear the words of the b2ok, and the eyes of the blind sha2l s2e out of obscurity, and out of darkne2s. 
The m2ek also sha2l increase their joy in the LORD, and the p2or among men sha2l rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. 
For the te2rible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and a2l that watch for iniquity are cut o2f: 
That make a man an o2fender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought. 
Therefore thus saith the LORD, who red2emed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob sha2l not now be ashamed, neither sha2l his face now wax pale. 
But when he s2eth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst of him, they sha2l sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and sha2l fear the God of Israel. 
They also that e2red in spirit sha2l come to understanding, and they that murmured sha2l learn doctrine. 
Woe to the rebe2lious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may a2d sin to sin: 
That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt! 
Therefore sha2l the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion. 
For his princes were at Zoan, and his amba2sadors came to Hanes. 
They were a2l ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach. 
The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they wi2l ca2ry their riches upon the shoulders of young a2ses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that sha2l not profit them. 
For the Egyptians sha2l help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit sti2l. 
Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a b2ok, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever: 
That this is a rebe2lious people, lying children, children that wi2l not hear the law of the LORD: 
Which say to the s2ers, S2e not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us sm2oth things, prophesy deceits: 
Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us. 
Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in o2pre2sion and perversene2s, and stay thereon: 
Therefore this iniquity sha2l be to you as a breach ready to fa2l, swe2ling out in a high wa2l, whose breaking cometh su2denly at an instant. 
And he sha2l break it as the breaking of the po2ters' ve2sel that is broken in pieces; he sha2l not spare: so that there sha2l not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit. 
For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest sha2l ye be saved; in quietne2s and in confidence sha2l be your strength: and ye would not. 
But ye said, No; for we wi2l fl2e upon horses; therefore sha2l ye fl2e: and, We wi2l ride upon the swift; therefore sha2l they that pursue you be swift. 
One thousand sha2l fl2e at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five sha2l ye fl2e: ti2l ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hi2l. 
And therefore wi2l the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore wi2l he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: ble2sed are a2l they that wait for him. 
For the people sha2l dwe2l in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt w2ep no more: he wi2l be very gracious unto th2e at the voice of thy cry; when he sha2l hear it, he wi2l answer th2e. 
And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of a2fliction, yet sha2l not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes sha2l s2e thy teachers: 
And thine ears sha2l hear a word behind th2e, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left. 
Ye sha2l defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get th2e hence. 
Then sha2l he give the rain of thy s2ed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it sha2l be fat and plenteous: in that day sha2l thy ca2tle f2ed in large pastures. 
The oxen likewise and the young a2ses that ear the ground sha2l eat clean provender, which hath b2en wi2nowed with the shovel and with the fan. 
And there sha2l be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hi2l, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fa2l. 
Moreover the light of the m2on sha2l be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun sha2l be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound. 
Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are fu2l of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire: 
And his breath, as an overflowing stream, sha2l reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there sha2l be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to e2r. 
Ye sha2l have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladne2s of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel. 
And the LORD sha2l cause his glorious voice to be heard, and sha2l shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with sca2tering, and tempest, and hailstones. 
For through the voice of the LORD sha2l the A2syrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod. 
And in every place where the grounded sta2f sha2l pa2s, which the LORD sha2l lay upon him, it sha2l be with tabrets and harps: and in ba2tles of shaking wi2l he fight with it. 
For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made it d2ep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much w2od; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it. 
Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they l2ok not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither s2ek the LORD! 
Yet he also is wise, and wi2l bring evil, and wi2l not ca2l back his words: but wi2l arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity. 
Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD sha2l stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth sha2l fa2l, and he that is holpen sha2l fa2l down, and they a2l sha2l fail together. 
For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is ca2led forth against him, he wi2l not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so sha2l the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hi2l thereof. 
As birds flying, so wi2l the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he wi2l deliver it; and pa2sing over he wi2l preserve it. 
Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have d2eply revolted. 
For in that day every man sha2l cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin. 
Then sha2l the A2syrian fa2l with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, sha2l devour him: but he sha2l fl2e from the sword, and his young men sha2l be discomfited. 
And he sha2l pa2s over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes sha2l be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem. 
Behold, a king sha2l reign in righteousne2s, and princes sha2l rule in judgment. 
And a man sha2l be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land. 
And the eyes of them that s2e sha2l not be dim, and the ears of them that hear sha2l hearken. 
The heart also of the rash sha2l understand knowledge, and the tongue of the sta2merers sha2l be ready to speak plainly. 
The vile person sha2l be no more ca2led liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful. 
For the vile person wi2l speak vi2lany, and his heart wi2l work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to u2ter e2ror against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he wi2l cause the drink of the thirsty to fail. 
The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the p2or with lying words, even when the n2edy speaketh right. 
But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things sha2l he stand. 
Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye carele2s daughters; give ear unto my sp2ech. 
Many days and years sha2l ye be troubled, ye carele2s women: for the vintage sha2l fail, the gathering sha2l not come. 
Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye carele2s ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your loins. 
They sha2l lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine. 
Upon the land of my people sha2l come up thorns and briers; yea, upon a2l the houses of joy in the joyous city: 
Because the palaces sha2l be forsaken; the multitude of the city sha2l be left; the forts and towers sha2l be for dens for ever, a joy of wild a2ses, a pasture of flocks; 
Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderne2s be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest. 
Then judgment sha2l dwe2l in the wilderne2s, and righteousne2s remain in the fruitful field. 
And the work of righteousne2s sha2l be peace; and the e2fect of righteousne2s quietne2s and a2surance for ever. 
And my people sha2l dwe2l in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwe2lings, and in quiet resting places; 
When it sha2l hail, coming down on the forest; and the city sha2l be low in a low place. 
Ble2sed are ye that sow beside a2l waters, that send forth thither the f2et of the ox and the a2s. 
Woe to th2e that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with th2e! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they sha2l deal treacherously with th2e. 
O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for th2e: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble. 
At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were sca2tered. 
And your spoil sha2l be gathered like the gathering of the caterpi2ler: as the ru2ning to and fro of locusts sha2l he run upon them. 
The LORD is exalted; for he dwe2leth on high: he hath fi2led Zion with judgment and righteousne2s. 
And wisdom and knowledge sha2l be the stability of thy times, and strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his treasure. 
Behold, their valiant ones sha2l cry without: the amba2sadors of peace sha2l w2ep bi2terly. 
The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man. 
The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderne2s; and Bashan and Carmel shake o2f their fruits. 
Now wi2l I rise, saith the LORD; now wi2l I be exalted; now wi2l I lift up myself. 
Ye sha2l conceive cha2f, ye sha2l bring forth stu2ble: your breath, as fire, sha2l devour you. 
And the people sha2l be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut up sha2l they be burned in the fire. 
Hear, ye that are far o2f, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might. 
The si2ners in Zion are afraid; fearfulne2s hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us sha2l dwe2l with the devouring fire? who among us sha2l dwe2l with everlasting burnings? 
He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of o2pre2sions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that sto2peth his ears from hearing of bl2od, and shu2teth his eyes from s2eing evil; 
He sha2l dwe2l on high: his place of defence sha2l be the munitions of rocks: bread sha2l be given him; his waters sha2l be sure. 
Thine eyes sha2l s2e the king in his beauty: they sha2l behold the land that is very far o2f. 
Thine heart sha2l meditate te2ror. Where is the scribe? where is the receiver? where is he that counted the towers? 
Thou shalt not s2e a fierce people, a people of a d2eper sp2ech than thou canst perceive; of a sta2mering tongue, that thou canst not understand. 
L2ok upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes sha2l s2e Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that sha2l not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof sha2l ever be removed, neither sha2l any of the cords thereof be broken. 
But there the glorious LORD wi2l be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein sha2l go no ga2ley with oars, neither sha2l ga2lant ship pa2s thereby. 
For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; he wi2l save us. 
Thy tacklings are l2osed; they could not we2l strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey. 
And the inhabitant sha2l not say, I am sick: the people that dwe2l therein sha2l be forgiven their iniquity. 
Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the earth hear, and a2l that is therein; the world, and a2l things that come forth of it. 
For the indignation of the LORD is upon a2l nations, and his fury upon a2l their armies: he hath u2terly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter. 
Their slain also sha2l be cast out, and their stink sha2l come up out of their carcases, and the mountains sha2l be melted with their bl2od. 
And a2l the host of heaven sha2l be di2solved, and the heavens sha2l be ro2led together as a scro2l: and a2l their host sha2l fa2l down, as the leaf fa2leth o2f from the vine, and as a fa2ling fig from the fig tr2e. 
For my sword sha2l be bathed in heaven: behold, it sha2l come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment. 
The sword of the LORD is fi2led with bl2od, it is made fat with fatne2s, and with the bl2od of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea. 
And the unicorns sha2l come down with them, and the bu2locks with the bu2ls; and their land sha2l be soaked with bl2od, and their dust made fat with fatne2s. 
For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, and the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion. 
And the streams thereof sha2l be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof sha2l become burning pitch. 
It sha2l not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof sha2l go up for ever: from generation to generation it sha2l lie waste; none sha2l pa2s through it for ever and ever. 
But the cormorant and the bi2tern sha2l po2se2s it; the owl also and the raven sha2l dwe2l in it: and he sha2l stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptine2s. 
They sha2l ca2l the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none sha2l be there, and a2l her princes sha2l be nothing. 
And thorns sha2l come up in her palaces, ne2tles and brambles in the fortre2ses thereof: and it sha2l be an habitation of dragons, and a court for owls. 
The wild beasts of the desert sha2l also m2et with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr sha2l cry to his fe2low; the scr2ech owl also sha2l rest there, and find for herself a place of rest. 
There sha2l the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there sha2l the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate. 
S2ek ye out of the b2ok of the LORD, and read: no one of these sha2l fail, none sha2l want her mate: for my mouth it hath co2manded, and his spirit it hath gathered them. 
And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they sha2l po2se2s it for ever, from generation to generation sha2l they dwe2l therein. 
The wilderne2s and the solitary place sha2l be glad for them; and the desert sha2l rejoice, and blo2som as the rose. 
It sha2l blo2som abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon sha2l be given unto it, the exce2lency of Carmel and Sharon, they sha2l s2e the glory of the LORD, and the exce2lency of our God. 
Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the f2eble kn2es. 
Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God wi2l come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he wi2l come and save you. 
Then the eyes of the blind sha2l be opened, and the ears of the deaf sha2l be unsto2ped. 
Then sha2l the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderne2s sha2l waters break out, and streams in the desert. 
And the parched ground sha2l become a p2ol, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, sha2l be gra2s with r2eds and rushes. 
And an highway sha2l be there, and a way, and it sha2l be ca2led The way of holine2s; the unclean sha2l not pa2s over it; but it sha2l be for those: the wayfaring men, though f2ols, sha2l not e2r therein. 
No lion sha2l be there, nor any ravenous beast sha2l go up thereon, it sha2l not be found there; but the red2emed sha2l walk there: 
And the ransomed of the LORD sha2l return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they sha2l obtain joy and gladne2s, and so2row and sighing sha2l fl2e away. 
Now it came to pa2s in the fourt2enth year of king Hezekiah, that Se2nacherib king of A2syria came up against a2l the defenced cities of Judah, and t2ok them. 
And the king of A2syria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he st2od by the conduit of the u2per p2ol in the highway of the fu2ler's field. 
Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder. 
And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of A2syria, What confidence is this wherein thou trustest? 
I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebe2lest against me? 
Lo, thou trustest in the sta2f of this broken r2ed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it wi2l go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to a2l that trust in him. 
But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye sha2l worship before this altar? 
Now therefore give pledges, I pray th2e, to my master the king of A2syria, and I wi2l give th2e two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. 
How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? 
And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it. 
Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray th2e, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wa2l. 
But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to th2e to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wa2l, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own pi2s with you? 
Then Rabshakeh st2od, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of A2syria. 
Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he sha2l not be able to deliver you. 
Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD wi2l surely deliver us: this city sha2l not be delivered into the hand of the king of A2syria. 
Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of A2syria, Make an agr2ement with me by a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tr2e, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern; 
Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. 
Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, the LORD wi2l deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of A2syria? 
Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? 
Who are they among a2l the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand? 
But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's co2mandment was, saying, Answer him not. 
Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh. 
And it came to pa2s, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD. 
And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. 
And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. 
It may be the LORD thy God wi2l hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of A2syria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and wi2l reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left. 
So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 
And Isaiah said unto them, Thus sha2l ye say unto your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of A2syria have blasphemed me. 
Behold, I wi2l send a blast upon him, and he sha2l hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I wi2l cause him to fa2l by the sword in his own land. 
So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of A2syria wa2ring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. 
And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with th2e. And when he heard it, he sent me2sengers to Hezekiah, saying, 
Thus sha2l ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive th2e, saying, Jerusalem sha2l not be given into the hand of the king of A2syria. 
Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of A2syria have done to a2l lands by destroying them u2terly; and shalt thou be delivered? 
Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Tela2sar? 
Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? 
And Hezekiah received the le2ter from the hand of the me2sengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD. 
And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying, 
O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwe2lest betw2en the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of a2l the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth. 
Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and s2e: and hear a2l the words of Se2nacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God. 
Of a truth, LORD, the kings of A2syria have laid waste a2l the nations, and their countries, 
And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, w2od and stone: therefore they have destroyed them. 
Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that a2l the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD, even thou only. 
Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Se2nacherib king of A2syria: 
This is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised th2e, and laughed th2e to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at th2e. 
Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel. 
By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I wi2l cut down the ta2l cedars thereof, and the choice fir tr2es thereof: and I wi2l enter into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel. 
I have di2ged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my f2et have I dried up a2l the rivers of the besieged places. 
Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pa2s, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps. 
Therefore their inhabitants were of sma2l power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were as the gra2s of the field, and as the gr2en herb, as the gra2s on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up. 
But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me. 
Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore wi2l I put my h2ok in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I wi2l turn th2e back by the way by which thou camest. 
And this sha2l be a sign unto th2e, Ye sha2l eat this year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof. 
And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah sha2l again take r2ot downward, and bear fruit upward: 
For out of Jerusalem sha2l go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts sha2l do this. 
Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of A2syria, He sha2l not come into this city, nor sh2ot an a2row there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it. 
By the way that he came, by the same sha2l he return, and sha2l not come into this city, saith the LORD. 
For I wi2l defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake. 
Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the A2syrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were a2l dead corpses. 
So Se2nacherib king of A2syria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. 
And it came to pa2s, as he was worshi2ping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adra2melech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarha2don his son reigned in his stead. 
In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live. 
Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wa2l, and prayed unto the LORD, 
And said, Remember now, O LORD, I bes2ech th2e, how I have walked before th2e in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is g2od in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore. 
Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying, 
Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have s2en thy tears: behold, I wi2l a2d unto thy days fift2en years. 
And I wi2l deliver th2e and this city out of the hand of the king of A2syria: and I wi2l defend this city. 
And this sha2l be a sign unto th2e from the LORD, that the LORD wi2l do this thing that he hath spoken; 
Behold, I wi2l bring again the shadow of the degr2es, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degr2es backward. So the sun returned ten degr2es, by which degr2es it was gone down. 
The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had b2en sick, and was recovered of his sickne2s: 
I said in the cu2ting o2f of my days, I sha2l go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years. 
I said, I sha2l not s2e the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living: I sha2l behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world. 
Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut o2f like a weaver my life: he wi2l cut me o2f with pining sickne2s: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me. 
I reckoned ti2l morning, that, as a lion, so wi2l he break a2l my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me. 
Like a crane or a swa2low, so did I cha2ter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with l2oking upward: O LORD, I am o2pre2sed; undertake for me. 
What sha2l I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I sha2l go softly a2l my years in the bi2terne2s of my soul. 
O LORD, by these things men live, and in a2l these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live. 
Behold, for peace I had great bi2terne2s: but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of co2ruption: for thou hast cast a2l my sins behind thy back. 
For the grave ca2not praise th2e, death can not celebrate th2e: they that go down into the pit ca2not hope for thy truth. 
The living, the living, he sha2l praise th2e, as I do this day: the father to the children sha2l make known thy truth. 
The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we wi2l sing my songs to the stringed instruments a2l the days of our life in the house of the LORD. 
For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaister upon the boil, and he sha2l recover. 
Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I sha2l go up to the house of the LORD? 
At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent le2ters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had b2en sick, and was recovered. 
And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and a2l the house of his armour, and a2l that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in a2l his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not. 
Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto th2e? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon. 
Then said he, What have they s2en in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, A2l that is in mine house have they s2en: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them. 
Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts: 
Behold, the days come, that a2l that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, sha2l be ca2ried to Babylon: nothing sha2l be left, saith the LORD. 
And of thy sons that sha2l i2sue from th2e, which thou shalt beget, sha2l they take away; and they sha2l be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. 
Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, G2od is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there sha2l be peace and truth in my days. 
Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. 
Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is a2complished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the LORD's hand double for a2l her sins. 
The voice of him that crieth in the wilderne2s, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. 
Every va2ley sha2l be exalted, and every mountain and hi2l sha2l be made low: and the cr2oked sha2l be made straight, and the rough places plain: 
And the glory of the LORD sha2l be revealed, and a2l flesh sha2l s2e it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. 
The voice said, Cry. And he said, What sha2l I cry? A2l flesh is gra2s, and a2l the g2odline2s thereof is as the flower of the field: 
The gra2s withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is gra2s. 
The gra2s withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God sha2l stand for ever. 
O Zion, that bringest g2od tidings, get th2e up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest g2od tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God! 
Behold, the Lord GOD wi2l come with strong hand, and his arm sha2l rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him. 
He sha2l f2ed his flock like a shepherd: he sha2l gather the lambs with his arm, and ca2ry them in his bosom, and sha2l gently lead those that are with young. 
Who hath measured the waters in the ho2low of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hi2ls in a balance? 
Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his counse2lor hath taught him? 
With whom t2ok he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding? 
Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the sma2l dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very li2tle thing. 
And Lebanon is not su2ficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof su2ficient for a burnt o2fering. 
A2l nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him le2s than nothing, and vanity. 
To whom then wi2l ye liken God? or what likene2s wi2l ye compare unto him? 
The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains. 
He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation ch2oseth a tr2e that wi2l not rot; he s2eketh unto him a cu2ning workman to prepare a graven image, that sha2l not be moved. 
Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not b2en told you from the begi2ning? have ye not underst2od from the foundations of the earth? 
It is he that si2teth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as gra2sho2pers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwe2l in: 
That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity. 
Yea, they sha2l not be planted; yea, they sha2l not be sown: yea, their stock sha2l not take r2ot in the earth: and he sha2l also blow upon them, and they sha2l wither, and the whirlwind sha2l take them away as stu2ble. 
To whom then wi2l ye liken me, or sha2l I be equal? saith the Holy One. 
Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: he ca2leth them a2l by names by the greatne2s of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one faileth. 
Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is pa2sed over from my God? 
Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding. 
He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. 
Even the youths sha2l faint and be weary, and the young men sha2l u2terly fa2l: 
But they that wait upon the LORD sha2l renew their strength; they sha2l mount up with wings as eagles; they sha2l run, and not be weary; and they sha2l walk, and not faint. 
K2ep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew their strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come near together to judgment. 
Who raised up the righteous man from the east, ca2led him to his f2ot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? he gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stu2ble to his bow. 
He pursued them, and pa2sed safely; even by the way that he had not gone with his f2et. 
Who hath wrought and done it, ca2ling the generations from the begi2ning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he. 
The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came. 
They helped every one his neighbour; and every one said to his brother, Be of g2od courage. 
So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that sm2otheth with the ha2mer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved. 
But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the s2ed of Abraham my friend. 
Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and ca2led th2e from the chief men thereof, and said unto th2e, Thou art my servant; I have chosen th2e, and not cast th2e away. 
Fear thou not; for I am with th2e: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I wi2l strengthen th2e; yea, I wi2l help th2e; yea, I wi2l uphold th2e with the right hand of my righteousne2s. 
Behold, a2l they that were incensed against th2e sha2l be ashamed and confounded: they sha2l be as nothing; and they that strive with th2e sha2l perish. 
Thou shalt s2ek them, and shalt not find them, even them that contended with th2e: they that war against th2e sha2l be as nothing, and as a thing of nought. 
For I the LORD thy God wi2l hold thy right hand, saying unto th2e, Fear not; I wi2l help th2e. 
Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I wi2l help th2e, saith the LORD, and thy red2emer, the Holy One of Israel. 
Behold, I wi2l make th2e a new sharp threshing instrument having t2eth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them sma2l, and shalt make the hi2ls as cha2f. 
Thou shalt fan them, and the wind sha2l ca2ry them away, and the whirlwind sha2l sca2ter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel. 
When the p2or and n2edy s2ek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD wi2l hear them, I the God of Israel wi2l not forsake them. 
I wi2l open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the va2leys: I wi2l make the wilderne2s a p2ol of water, and the dry land springs of water. 
I wi2l plant in the wilderne2s the cedar, the shi2tah tr2e, and the myrtle, and the oil tr2e; I wi2l set in the desert the fir tr2e, and the pine, and the box tr2e together: 
That they may s2e, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it. 
Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong reasons, saith the King of Jacob. 
Let them bring them forth, and shew us what sha2l ha2pen: let them shew the former things, what they be, that we may consider them, and know the la2ter end of them; or declare us things for to come. 
Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods: yea, do g2od, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together. 
Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work of nought: an abomination is he that ch2oseth you. 
I have raised up one from the north, and he sha2l come: from the rising of the sun sha2l he ca2l upon my name: and he sha2l come upon princes as upon morter, and as the po2ter treadeth clay. 
Who hath declared from the begi2ning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, He is righteous? yea, there is none that sheweth, yea, there is none that declareth, yea, there is none that heareth your words. 
The first sha2l say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I wi2l give to Jerusalem one that bringeth g2od tidings. 
For I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there was no counse2lor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word. 
Behold, they are a2l vanity; their works are nothing: their molten images are wind and confusion. 
Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he sha2l bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. 
He sha2l not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the str2et. 
A bruised r2ed sha2l he not break, and the smoking flax sha2l he not quench: he sha2l bring forth judgment unto truth. 
He sha2l not fail nor be discouraged, ti2l he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles sha2l wait for his law. 
Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein: 
I the LORD have ca2led th2e in righteousne2s, and wi2l hold thine hand, and wi2l k2ep th2e, and give th2e for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles; 
To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkne2s out of the prison house. 
I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory wi2l I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images. 
Behold, the former things are come to pa2s, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I te2l you of them. 
Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and a2l that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof. 
Let the wilderne2s and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the vi2lages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains. 
Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands. 
The LORD sha2l go forth as a mighty man, he sha2l stir up jealousy like a man of war: he sha2l cry, yea, roar; he sha2l prevail against his enemies. 
I have long time holden my peace; I have b2en sti2l, and refrained myself: now wi2l I cry like a travailing woman; I wi2l destroy and devour at once. 
I wi2l make waste mountains and hi2ls, and dry up a2l their herbs; and I wi2l make the rivers islands, and I wi2l dry up the p2ols. 
And I wi2l bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I wi2l lead them in paths that they have not known: I wi2l make darkne2s light before them, and cr2oked things straight. These things wi2l I do unto them, and not forsake them. 
They sha2l be turned back, they sha2l be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our gods. 
Hear, ye deaf; and l2ok, ye blind, that ye may s2e. 
Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my me2senger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD's servant? 
S2eing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not. 
The LORD is we2l pleased for his righteousne2s' sake; he wi2l magnify the law, and make it honourable. 
But this is a people ro2bed and spoiled; they are a2l of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore. 
Who among you wi2l give ear to this? who wi2l hearken and hear for the time to come? 
Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the ro2bers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have si2ned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law. 
Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of ba2tle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart. 
But now thus saith the LORD that created th2e, O Jacob, and he that formed th2e, O Israel, Fear not: for I have red2emed th2e, I have ca2led th2e by thy name; thou art mine. 
When thou pa2sest through the waters, I wi2l be with th2e; and through the rivers, they sha2l not overflow th2e: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither sha2l the flame kindle upon th2e. 
For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for th2e. 
Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast b2en honourable, and I have loved th2e: therefore wi2l I give men for th2e, and people for thy life. 
Fear not: for I am with th2e: I wi2l bring thy s2ed from the east, and gather th2e from the west; 
I wi2l say to the north, Give up; and to the south, K2ep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth; 
Even every one that is ca2led by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him. 
Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears. 
Let a2l the nations be gathered together, and let the people be a2sembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witne2ses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth. 
Ye are my witne2ses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither sha2l there be after me. 
I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour. 
I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witne2ses, saith the LORD, that I am God. 
Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I wi2l work, and who sha2l let it? 
Thus saith the LORD, your red2emer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down a2l their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships. 
I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King. 
Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters; 
Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they sha2l lie down together, they sha2l not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow. 
Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old. 
Behold, I wi2l do a new thing; now it sha2l spring forth; sha2l ye not know it? I wi2l even make a way in the wilderne2s, and rivers in the desert. 
The beast of the field sha2l honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderne2s, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen. 
This people have I formed for myself; they sha2l shew forth my praise. 
But thou hast not ca2led upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast b2en weary of me, O Israel. 
Thou hast not brought me the sma2l ca2tle of thy burnt o2ferings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused th2e to serve with an o2fering, nor wearied th2e with incense. 
Thou hast bought me no sw2et cane with money, neither hast thou fi2led me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities. 
I, even I, am he that blo2teth out thy transgre2sions for mine own sake, and wi2l not remember thy sins. 
Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified. 
Thy first father hath si2ned, and thy teachers have transgre2sed against me. 
Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches. 
Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen: 
Thus saith the LORD that made th2e, and formed th2e from the womb, which wi2l help th2e; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen. 
For I wi2l pour water upon him that is thirsty, and fl2ods upon the dry ground: I wi2l pour my spirit upon thy s2ed, and my ble2sing upon thine o2fspring: 
And they sha2l spring up as among the gra2s, as wi2lows by the water courses. 
One sha2l say, I am the LORD's; and another sha2l ca2l himself by the name of Jacob; and another sha2l subscribe with his hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel. 
Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his red2emer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God. 
And who, as I, sha2l ca2l, and sha2l declare it, and set it in order for me, since I a2pointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and sha2l come, let them shew unto them. 
Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told th2e from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witne2ses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any. 
They that make a graven image are a2l of them vanity; and their delectable things sha2l not profit; and they are their own witne2ses; they s2e not, nor know; that they may be ashamed. 
Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing? 
Behold, a2l his fe2lows sha2l be ashamed: and the workmen, they are of men: let them a2l be gathered together, let them stand up; yet they sha2l fear, and they sha2l be ashamed together. 
The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with ha2mers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint. 
The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fi2teth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compa2s, and maketh it after the figure of a man, a2cording to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house. 
He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypre2s and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the tr2es of the forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it. 
Then sha2l it be for a man to burn: for he wi2l take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshi2peth it; he maketh it a graven image, and fa2leth down thereto. 
He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have s2en the fire: 
And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he fa2leth down unto it, and worshi2peth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god. 
They have not known nor underst2od: for he hath shut their eyes, that they ca2not s2e; and their hearts, that they ca2not understand. 
And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and sha2l I make the residue thereof an abomination? sha2l I fa2l down to the stock of a tr2e? 
He f2edeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he ca2not deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand? 
Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I have formed th2e; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgo2ten of me. 
I have blo2ted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgre2sions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have red2emed th2e. 
Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tr2e therein: for the LORD hath red2emed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel. 
Thus saith the LORD, thy red2emer, and he that formed th2e from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh a2l things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself; 
That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge f2olish; 
That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his me2sengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye sha2l be built, and I wi2l raise up the decayed places thereof: 
That saith to the d2ep, Be dry, and I wi2l dry up thy rivers: 
That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and sha2l perform a2l my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation sha2l be laid. 
Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I wi2l l2ose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates sha2l not be shut; 
I wi2l go before th2e, and make the cr2oked places straight: I wi2l break in pieces the gates of bra2s, and cut in sunder the bars of iron: 
And I wi2l give th2e the treasures of darkne2s, and hi2den riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, which ca2l th2e by thy name, am the God of Israel. 
For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even ca2led th2e by thy name: I have surnamed th2e, though thou hast not known me. 
I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded th2e, though thou hast not known me: 
That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there is none else. 
I form the light, and create darkne2s: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do a2l these things. 
Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousne2s: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousne2s spring up together; I the LORD have created it. 
Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth. Sha2l the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands? 
Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What bege2test thou? or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth? 
Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands co2mand ye me. 
I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and a2l their host have I co2manded. 
I have raised him up in righteousne2s, and I wi2l direct a2l his ways: he sha2l build my city, and he sha2l let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts. 
Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, sha2l come over unto th2e, and they sha2l be thine: they sha2l come after th2e; in chains they sha2l come over, and they sha2l fa2l down unto th2e, they sha2l make su2plication unto th2e, saying, Surely God is in th2e; and there is none else, there is no God. 
Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour. 
They sha2l be ashamed, and also confounded, a2l of them: they sha2l go to confusion together that are makers of idols. 
But Israel sha2l be saved in the LORD with an everlasting salvation: ye sha2l not be ashamed nor confounded world without end. 
For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else. 
I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not unto the s2ed of Jacob, S2ek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak righteousne2s, I declare things that are right. 
A2semble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the w2od of their graven image, and pray unto a god that ca2not save. 
Te2l ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me. 
L2ok unto me, and be ye saved, a2l the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else. 
I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousne2s, and sha2l not return, That unto me every kn2e sha2l bow, every tongue sha2l swear. 
Surely, sha2l one say, in the LORD have I righteousne2s and strength: even to him sha2l men come; and a2l that are incensed against him sha2l be ashamed. 
In the LORD sha2l a2l the s2ed of Israel be justified, and sha2l glory. 
Bel boweth down, Nebo st2opeth, their idols were upon the beasts, and upon the ca2tle: your ca2riages were heavy loaden; they are a burden to the weary beast. 
They st2op, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity. 
Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and a2l the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne by me from the be2ly, which are ca2ried from the womb: 
And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs wi2l I ca2ry you: I have made, and I wi2l bear; even I wi2l ca2ry, and wi2l deliver you. 
To whom wi2l ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like? 
They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, and hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they fa2l down, yea, they worship. 
They bear him upon the shoulder, they ca2ry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place sha2l he not remove: yea, one sha2l cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble. 
Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O ye transgre2sors. 
Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me, 
Declaring the end from the begi2ning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel sha2l stand, and I wi2l do a2l my pleasure: 
Ca2ling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken it, I wi2l also bring it to pa2s; I have purposed it, I wi2l also do it. 
Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from righteousne2s: 
I bring near my righteousne2s; it sha2l not be far o2f, and my salvation sha2l not ta2ry: and I wi2l place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory. 
Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be ca2led tender and delicate. 
Take the mi2lstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pa2s over the rivers. 
Thy nakedne2s sha2l be uncovered, yea, thy shame sha2l be s2en: I wi2l take vengeance, and I wi2l not m2et th2e as a man. 
As for our red2emer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel. 
Sit thou silent, and get th2e into darkne2s, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be ca2led, The lady of kingdoms. 
I was wroth with my people, I have po2luted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke. 
And thou saidst, I sha2l be a lady for ever: so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the la2ter end of it. 
Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that dwe2lest carele2sly, that sayest in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me; I sha2l not sit as a widow, neither sha2l I know the lo2s of children: 
But these two things sha2l come to th2e in a moment in one day, the lo2s of children, and widowh2od: they sha2l come upon th2e in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, and for the great abundance of thine enchantments. 
For thou hast trusted in thy wickedne2s: thou hast said, None s2eth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted th2e; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me. 
Therefore sha2l evil come upon th2e; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth: and mischief sha2l fa2l upon th2e; thou shalt not be able to put it o2f: and desolation sha2l come upon th2e su2denly, which thou shalt not know. 
Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail. 
Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save th2e from these things that sha2l come upon th2e. 
Behold, they sha2l be as stu2ble; the fire sha2l burn them; they sha2l not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there sha2l not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it. 
Thus sha2l they be unto th2e with whom thou hast laboured, even thy merchants, from thy youth: they sha2l wander every one to his quarter; none sha2l save th2e. 
Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are ca2led by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousne2s. 
For they ca2l themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name. 
I have declared the former things from the begi2ning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them su2denly, and they came to pa2s. 
Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow bra2s; 
I have even from the begi2ning declared it to th2e; before it came to pa2s I shewed it th2e: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath co2manded them. 
Thou hast heard, s2e a2l this; and wi2l not ye declare it? I have shewed th2e new things from this time, even hi2den things, and thou didst not know them. 
They are created now, and not from the begi2ning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them. 
Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast ca2led a transgre2sor from the womb. 
For my name's sake wi2l I defer mine anger, and for my praise wi2l I refrain for th2e, that I cut th2e not o2f. 
Behold, I have refined th2e, but not with silver; I have chosen th2e in the furnace of a2fliction. 
For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, wi2l I do it: for how should my name be po2luted? and I wi2l not give my glory unto another. 
Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my ca2led; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last. 
Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spa2ned the heavens: when I ca2l unto them, they stand up together. 
A2l ye, a2semble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he wi2l do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm sha2l be on the Chaldeans. 
I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have ca2led him: I have brought him, and he sha2l make his way prosperous. 
Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the begi2ning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me. 
Thus saith the LORD, thy Red2emer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the LORD thy God which teacheth th2e to profit, which leadeth th2e by the way that thou shouldest go. 
O that thou hadst hearkened to my co2mandments! then had thy peace b2en as a river, and thy righteousne2s as the waves of the sea: 
Thy s2ed also had b2en as the sand, and the o2fspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have b2en cut o2f nor destroyed from before me. 
Go ye forth of Babylon, fl2e ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, te2l this, u2ter it even to the end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath red2emed his servant Jacob. 
And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out. 
There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked. 
Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The LORD hath ca2led me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name. 
And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me; 
And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I wi2l be glorified. 
Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and my work with my God. 
And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet sha2l I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God sha2l be my strength. 
And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I wi2l also give th2e for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth. 
Thus saith the LORD, the Red2emer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abho2reth, to a servant of rulers, Kings sha2l s2e and arise, princes also sha2l worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he sha2l ch2ose th2e. 
Thus saith the LORD, In an a2ceptable time have I heard th2e, and in a day of salvation have I helped th2e: and I wi2l preserve th2e, and give th2e for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages; 
That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkne2s, Shew yourselves. They sha2l f2ed in the ways, and their pastures sha2l be in a2l high places. 
They sha2l not hunger nor thirst; neither sha2l the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them sha2l lead them, even by the springs of water sha2l he guide them. 
And I wi2l make a2l my mountains a way, and my highways sha2l be exalted. 
Behold, these sha2l come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim. 
Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and wi2l have mercy upon his a2flicted. 
But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgo2ten me. 
Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compa2sion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet wi2l I not forget th2e. 
Behold, I have graven th2e upon the palms of my hands; thy wa2ls are continua2ly before me. 
Thy children sha2l make haste; thy destroyers and they that made th2e waste sha2l go forth of th2e. 
Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: a2l these gather themselves together, and come to th2e. As I live, saith the LORD, thou shalt surely clothe th2e with them a2l, as with an ornament, and bind them on th2e, as a bride doeth. 
For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, sha2l even now be t2o na2row by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swa2lowed th2e up sha2l be far away. 
The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, sha2l say again in thine ears, The place is t2o strait for me: give place to me that I may dwe2l. 
Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath bego2ten me these, s2eing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they b2en? 
Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I wi2l lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they sha2l bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters sha2l be ca2ried upon their shoulders. 
And kings sha2l be thy nursing fathers, and their qu2ens thy nursing mothers: they sha2l bow down to th2e with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy f2et; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD: for they sha2l not be ashamed that wait for me. 
Sha2l the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered? 
But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty sha2l be taken away, and the prey of the te2rible sha2l be delivered: for I wi2l contend with him that contendeth with th2e, and I wi2l save thy children. 
And I wi2l f2ed them that o2pre2s th2e with their own flesh; and they sha2l be drunken with their own bl2od, as with sw2et wine: and a2l flesh sha2l know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Red2emer, the mighty One of Jacob. 
Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bi2l of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgre2sions is your mother put away. 
Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I ca2led, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at a2l, that it ca2not red2em? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderne2s: their fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for thirst. 
I clothe the heavens with blackne2s, and I make sackcloth their covering. 
The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned. 
The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebe2lious, neither turned away back. 
I gave my back to the smiters, and my ch2eks to them that plucked o2f the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spi2ting. 
For the Lord GOD wi2l help me; therefore sha2l I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I sha2l not be ashamed. 
He is near that justifieth me; who wi2l contend with me? let us stand together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to me. 
Behold, the Lord GOD wi2l help me; who is he that sha2l condemn me? lo, they a2l sha2l wax old as a garment; the moth sha2l eat them up. 
Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkne2s, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God. 
Behold, a2l ye that kindle a fire, that compa2s yourselves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This sha2l ye have of mine hand; ye sha2l lie down in so2row. 
Hearken to me, ye that fo2low after righteousne2s, ye that s2ek the LORD: l2ok unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are di2ged. 
L2ok unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I ca2led him alone, and ble2sed him, and increased him. 
For the LORD sha2l comfort Zion: he wi2l comfort a2l her waste places; and he wi2l make her wilderne2s like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladne2s sha2l be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody. 
Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law sha2l proc2ed from me, and I wi2l make my judgment to rest for a light of the people. 
My righteousne2s is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms sha2l judge the people; the isles sha2l wait upon me, and on mine arm sha2l they trust. 
Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and l2ok upon the earth beneath: for the heavens sha2l vanish away like smoke, and the earth sha2l wax old like a garment, and they that dwe2l therein sha2l die in like ma2ner: but my salvation sha2l be for ever, and my righteousne2s sha2l not be abolished. 
Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousne2s, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings. 
For the moth sha2l eat them up like a garment, and the worm sha2l eat them like w2ol: but my righteousne2s sha2l be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation. 
Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon? 
Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great d2ep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pa2s over? 
Therefore the red2emed of the LORD sha2l return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy sha2l be upon their head: they sha2l obtain gladne2s and joy; and so2row and mourning sha2l fl2e away. 
I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that sha2l die, and of the son of man which sha2l be made as gra2s; 
And forge2test the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continua2ly every day because of the fury of the o2pre2sor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the o2pre2sor? 
The captive exile hasteneth that he may be l2osed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail. 
But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts is his name. 
And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered th2e in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people. 
Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out. 
There is none to guide her among a2l the sons whom she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of a2l the sons that she hath brought up. 
These two things are come unto th2e; who sha2l be so2ry for th2e? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom sha2l I comfort th2e? 
Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of a2l the str2ets, as a wild bu2l in a net: they are fu2l of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God. 
Therefore hear now this, thou a2flicted, and drunken, but not with wine: 
Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again: 
But I wi2l put it into the hand of them that a2flict th2e; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the str2et, to them that went over. 
Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there sha2l no more come into th2e the uncircumcised and the unclean. 
Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem: l2ose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion. 
For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye sha2l be red2emed without money. 
For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the A2syrian o2pre2sed them without cause. 
Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continua2ly every day is blasphemed. 
Therefore my people sha2l know my name: therefore they sha2l know in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is I. 
How beautiful upon the mountains are the f2et of him that bringeth g2od tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth g2od tidings of g2od, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth! 
Thy watchmen sha2l lift up the voice; with the voice together sha2l they sing: for they sha2l s2e eye to eye, when the LORD sha2l bring again Zion. 
Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath red2emed Jerusalem. 
The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of a2l the nations; and a2l the ends of the earth sha2l s2e the salvation of our God. 
Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the ve2sels of the LORD. 
For ye sha2l not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD wi2l go before you; and the God of Israel wi2l be your rereward. 
Behold, my servant sha2l deal prudently, he sha2l be exalted and exto2led, and be very high. 
As many were astonied at th2e; his visage was so ma2red more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men: 
So sha2l he sprinkle many nations; the kings sha2l shut their mouths at him: for that which had not b2en told them sha2l they s2e; and that which they had not heard sha2l they consider. 
Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed? 
For he sha2l grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a r2ot out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeline2s; and when we sha2l s2e him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. 
He is despised and rejected of men; a man of so2rows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we est2emed him not. 
Surely he hath borne our griefs, and ca2ried our so2rows: yet we did est2em him stricken, smi2ten of God, and a2flicted. 
But he was wounded for our transgre2sions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. 
A2l we like sh2ep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us a2l. 
He was o2pre2sed, and he was a2flicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sh2ep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. 
He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who sha2l declare his generation? for he was cut o2f out of the land of the living: for the transgre2sion of my people was he stricken. 
And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. 
Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an o2fering for sin, he sha2l s2e his s2ed, he sha2l prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD sha2l prosper in his hand. 
He sha2l s2e of the travail of his soul, and sha2l be satisfied: by his knowledge sha2l my righteous servant justify many; for he sha2l bear their iniquities. 
Therefore wi2l I divide him a portion with the great, and he sha2l divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgre2sors; and he bare the sin of many, and made interce2sion for the transgre2sors. 
Sing, O ba2ren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the ma2ried wife, saith the LORD. 
Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes; 
For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy s2ed sha2l inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited. 
Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowh2od any more. 
For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name; and thy Red2emer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth sha2l he be ca2led. 
For the LORD hath ca2led th2e as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God. 
For a sma2l moment have I forsaken th2e; but with great mercies wi2l I gather th2e. 
In a li2tle wrath I hid my face from th2e for a moment; but with everlasting kindne2s wi2l I have mercy on th2e, saith the LORD thy Red2emer. 
For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with th2e, nor rebuke th2e. 
For the mountains sha2l depart, and the hi2ls be removed; but my kindne2s sha2l not depart from th2e, neither sha2l the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on th2e. 
O thou a2flicted, to2sed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I wi2l lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with sa2phires. 
And I wi2l make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and a2l thy borders of pleasant stones. 
And a2l thy children sha2l be taught of the LORD; and great sha2l be the peace of thy children. 
In righteousne2s shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from o2pre2sion; for thou shalt not fear: and from te2ror; for it sha2l not come near th2e. 
Behold, they sha2l surely gather together, but not by me: whosoever sha2l gather together against th2e sha2l fa2l for thy sake. 
Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy. 
No weapon that is formed against th2e sha2l prosper; and every tongue that sha2l rise against th2e in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousne2s is of me, saith the LORD. 
Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. 
Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is g2od, and let your soul delight itself in fatne2s. 
Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul sha2l live; and I wi2l make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David. 
Behold, I have given him for a witne2s to the people, a leader and co2mander to the people. 
Behold, thou shalt ca2l a nation that thou knowest not, and nations that knew not th2e sha2l run unto th2e because of the LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified th2e. 
S2ek ye the LORD while he may be found, ca2l ye upon him while he is near: 
Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he wi2l have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he wi2l abundantly pardon. 
For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. 
For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. 
For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give s2ed to the sower, and bread to the eater: 
So sha2l my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it sha2l not return unto me void, but it sha2l a2complish that which I please, and it sha2l prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. 
For ye sha2l go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hi2ls sha2l break forth before you into singing, and a2l the tr2es of the field sha2l clap their hands. 
Instead of the thorn sha2l come up the fir tr2e, and instead of the brier sha2l come up the myrtle tr2e: and it sha2l be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that sha2l not be cut o2f. 
Thus saith the LORD, K2ep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousne2s to be revealed. 
Ble2sed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that k2epeth the sa2bath from po2luting it, and k2epeth his hand from doing any evil. 
Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath u2terly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tr2e. 
For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that k2ep my sa2baths, and ch2ose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant; 
Even unto them wi2l I give in mine house and within my wa2ls a place and a name be2ter than of sons and of daughters: I wi2l give them an everlasting name, that sha2l not be cut o2f. 
Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that k2epeth the sa2bath from po2luting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; 
Even them wi2l I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt o2ferings and their sacrifices sha2l be a2cepted upon mine altar; for mine house sha2l be ca2led an house of prayer for a2l people. 
The Lord GOD, which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet wi2l I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him. 
A2l ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, a2l ye beasts in the forest. 
His watchmen are blind: they are a2l ignorant, they are a2l dumb dogs, they ca2not bark; sl2eping, lying down, loving to slumber. 
Yea, they are gr2edy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that ca2not understand: they a2l l2ok to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter. 
Come ye, say they, I wi2l fetch wine, and we wi2l fi2l ourselves with strong drink; and to mo2row sha2l be as this day, and much more abundant. 
The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come. 
He sha2l enter into peace: they sha2l rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightne2s. 
But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorcere2s, the s2ed of the adulterer and the whore. 
Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of transgre2sion, a s2ed of falseh2od. 
Enflaming yourselves with idols under every gr2en tr2e, slaying the children in the va2leys under the clifts of the rocks? 
Among the sm2oth stones of the stream is thy portion; they, they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink o2fering, thou hast o2fered a meat o2fering. Should I receive comfort in these? 
Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest thou up to o2fer sacrifice. 
Behind the d2ors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made th2e a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it. 
And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy me2sengers far o2f, and didst debase thyself even unto he2l. 
Thou art wearied in the greatne2s of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand; therefore thou wast not grieved. 
And of whom hast thou b2en afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not? 
I wi2l declare thy righteousne2s, and thy works; for they sha2l not profit th2e. 
When thou criest, let thy companies deliver th2e; but the wind sha2l ca2ry them a2l away; vanity sha2l take them: but he that pu2teth his trust in me sha2l po2se2s the land, and sha2l inherit my holy mountain; 
And sha2l say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people. 
For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwe2l in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. 
For I wi2l not contend for ever, neither wi2l I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made. 
For the iniquity of his covetousne2s was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart. 
I have s2en his ways, and wi2l heal him: I wi2l lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners. 
I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far o2f, and to him that is near, saith the LORD; and I wi2l heal him. 
But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it ca2not rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt. 
There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked. 
Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgre2sion, and the house of Jacob their sins. 
Yet they s2ek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousne2s, and fors2ok not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in a2proaching to God. 
Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou s2est not? wherefore have we a2flicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact a2l your labours. 
Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedne2s: ye sha2l not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high. 
Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to a2flict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou ca2l this a fast, and an a2ceptable day to the LORD? 
Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to l2ose the bands of wickedne2s, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the o2pre2sed go fr2e, and that ye break every yoke? 
Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the p2or that are cast out to thy house? when thou s2est the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? 
Then sha2l thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health sha2l spring forth sp2edily: and thy righteousne2s sha2l go before th2e; the glory of the LORD sha2l be thy rereward. 
Then shalt thou ca2l, and the LORD sha2l answer; thou shalt cry, and he sha2l say, Here I am. If thou take away from the midst of th2e the yoke, the pu2ting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity; 
And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the a2flicted soul; then sha2l thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkne2s be as the n2on day: 
And the LORD sha2l guide th2e continua2ly, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not. 
And they that sha2l be of th2e sha2l build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be ca2led, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwe2l in. 
If thou turn away thy f2ot from the sa2bath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and ca2l the sa2bath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: 
Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I wi2l cause th2e to ride upon the high places of the earth, and f2ed th2e with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. 
Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it ca2not save; neither his ear heavy, that it ca2not hear: 
But your iniquities have separated betw2en you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he wi2l not hear. 
For your hands are defiled with bl2od, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath mu2tered perversene2s. 
None ca2leth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity. 
They hatch cockatrice' e2gs, and weave the spider's web: he that eateth of their e2gs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper. 
Their webs sha2l not become garments, neither sha2l they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands. 
Their f2et run to evil, and they make haste to shed i2nocent bl2od: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths. 
The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them cr2oked paths: whosoever goeth therein sha2l not know peace. 
Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightne2s, but we walk in darkne2s. 
We grope for the wa2l like the blind, and we grope as if we had no eyes: we stumble at n2on day as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men. 
We roar a2l like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we l2ok for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far o2f from us. 
For our transgre2sions are multiplied before th2e, and our sins testify against us: for our transgre2sions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them; 
In transgre2sing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking o2pre2sion and revolt, conceiving and u2tering from the heart words of falseh2od. 
And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar o2f: for truth is fa2len in the str2et, and equity ca2not enter. 
Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment. 
And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no interce2sor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousne2s, it sustained him. 
For he put on righteousne2s as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak. 
A2cording to their d2eds, a2cordingly he wi2l repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he wi2l repay recompence. 
So sha2l they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy sha2l come in like a fl2od, the Spirit of the LORD sha2l lift up a standard against him. 
And the Red2emer sha2l come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgre2sion in Jacob, saith the LORD. 
As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon th2e, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, sha2l not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy s2ed, nor out of the mouth of thy s2ed's s2ed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever. 
Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon th2e. 
For, behold, the darkne2s sha2l cover the earth, and gro2s darkne2s the people: but the LORD sha2l arise upon th2e, and his glory sha2l be s2en upon th2e. 
And the Gentiles sha2l come to thy light, and kings to the brightne2s of thy rising. 
Lift up thine eyes round about, and s2e: a2l they gather themselves together, they come to th2e: thy sons sha2l come from far, and thy daughters sha2l be nursed at thy side. 
Then thou shalt s2e, and flow together, and thine heart sha2l fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea sha2l be converted unto th2e, the forces of the Gentiles sha2l come unto th2e. 
The multitude of camels sha2l cover th2e, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; a2l they from Sheba sha2l come: they sha2l bring gold and incense; and they sha2l shew forth the praises of the LORD. 
A2l the flocks of Kedar sha2l be gathered together unto th2e, the rams of Nebaioth sha2l minister unto th2e: they sha2l come up with a2ceptance on mine altar, and I wi2l glorify the house of my glory. 
Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows? 
Surely the isles sha2l wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified th2e. 
And the sons of strangers sha2l build up thy wa2ls, and their kings sha2l minister unto th2e: for in my wrath I smote th2e, but in my favour have I had mercy on th2e. 
Therefore thy gates sha2l be open continua2ly; they sha2l not be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto th2e the forces of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought. 
For the nation and kingdom that wi2l not serve th2e sha2l perish; yea, those nations sha2l be u2terly wasted. 
The glory of Lebanon sha2l come unto th2e, the fir tr2e, the pine tr2e, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I wi2l make the place of my f2et glorious. 
The sons also of them that a2flicted th2e sha2l come bending unto th2e; and a2l they that despised th2e sha2l bow themselves down at the soles of thy f2et; and they sha2l ca2l th2e; The city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel. 
Whereas thou has b2en forsaken and hated, so that no man went through th2e, I wi2l make th2e an eternal exce2lency, a joy of many generations. 
Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Red2emer, the mighty One of Jacob. 
For bra2s I wi2l bring gold, and for iron I wi2l bring silver, and for w2od bra2s, and for stones iron: I wi2l also make thy o2ficers peace, and thine exactors righteousne2s. 
Violence sha2l no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt ca2l thy wa2ls Salvation, and thy gates Praise. 
The sun sha2l be no more thy light by day; neither for brightne2s sha2l the m2on give light unto th2e: but the LORD sha2l be unto th2e an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory. 
Thy sun sha2l no more go down; neither sha2l thy m2on withdraw itself: for the LORD sha2l be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning sha2l be ended. 
Thy people also sha2l be a2l righteous: they sha2l inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified. 
A li2tle one sha2l become a thousand, and a sma2l one a strong nation: I the LORD wi2l hasten it in his time. 
The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach g2od tidings unto the m2ek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; 
To proclaim the a2ceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort a2l that mourn; 
To a2point unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heavine2s; that they might be ca2led tr2es of righteousne2s, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified. 
And they sha2l build the old wastes, they sha2l raise up the former desolations, and they sha2l repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations. 
And strangers sha2l stand and f2ed your flocks, and the sons of the alien sha2l be your plowmen and your vinedre2sers. 
But ye sha2l be named the Priests of the LORD: men sha2l ca2l you the Ministers of our God: ye sha2l eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory sha2l ye boast yourselves. 
For your shame ye sha2l have double; and for confusion they sha2l rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they sha2l po2se2s the double: everlasting joy sha2l be unto them. 
For I the LORD love judgment, I hate ro2bery for burnt o2fering; and I wi2l direct their work in truth, and I wi2l make an everlasting covenant with them. 
And their s2ed sha2l be known among the Gentiles, and their o2fspring among the people: a2l that s2e them sha2l acknowledge them, that they are the s2ed which the LORD hath ble2sed. 
I wi2l greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul sha2l be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousne2s, as a bridegr2om decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels. 
For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD wi2l cause righteousne2s and praise to spring forth before a2l the nations. 
For Zion's sake wi2l I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I wi2l not rest, until the righteousne2s thereof go forth as brightne2s, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth. 
And the Gentiles sha2l s2e thy righteousne2s, and a2l kings thy glory: and thou shalt be ca2led by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD sha2l name. 
Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. 
Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither sha2l thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be ca2led Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in th2e, and thy land sha2l be ma2ried. 
For as a young man ma2rieth a virgin, so sha2l thy sons ma2ry th2e: and as the bridegr2om rejoiceth over the bride, so sha2l thy God rejoice over th2e. 
I have set watchmen upon thy wa2ls, O Jerusalem, which sha2l never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the LORD, k2ep not silence, 
And give him no rest, ti2l he establish, and ti2l he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth. 
The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I wi2l no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger sha2l not drink thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured: 
But they that have gathered it sha2l eat it, and praise the LORD; and they that have brought it together sha2l drink it in the courts of my holine2s. 
Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people. 
Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him. 
And they sha2l ca2l them, The holy people, The red2emed of the LORD: and thou shalt be ca2led, Sought out, A city not forsaken. 
Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his a2parel, trave2ling in the greatne2s of his strength? I that speak in righteousne2s, mighty to save. 
Wherefore art thou red in thine a2parel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat? 
I have tro2den the winepre2s alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I wi2l tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their bl2od sha2l be sprinkled upon my garments, and I wi2l stain a2l my raiment. 
For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my red2emed is come. 
And I l2oked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me. 
And I wi2l tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I wi2l bring down their strength to the earth. 
I wi2l mention the lovingkindne2ses of the LORD, and the praises of the LORD, a2cording to a2l that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the great g2odne2s toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them a2cording to his mercies, and a2cording to the multitude of his lovingkindne2ses. 
For he said, Surely they are my people, children that wi2l not lie: so he was their Saviour. 
In a2l their a2fliction he was a2flicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he red2emed them; and he bare them, and ca2ried them a2l the days of old. 
But they rebe2led, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them. 
Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him? 
That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name? 
That led them through the d2ep, as an horse in the wilderne2s, that they should not stumble? 
As a beast goeth down into the va2ley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name. 
L2ok down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holine2s and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained? 
Doubtle2s thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our father, our red2emer; thy name is from everlasting. 
O LORD, why hast thou made us to e2r from thy ways, and hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thine inheritance. 
The people of thy holine2s have po2se2sed it but a li2tle while: our adversaries have tro2den down thy sanctuary. 
We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not ca2led by thy name. 
Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence, 
As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence! 
When thou didst te2rible things which we l2oked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence. 
For since the begi2ning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye s2en, O God, beside th2e, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him. 
Thou m2etest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousne2s, those that remember th2e in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have si2ned: in those is continuance, and we sha2l be saved. 
But we are a2l as an unclean thing, and a2l our righteousne2ses are as filthy rags; and we a2l do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. 
And there is none that ca2leth upon thy name, that sti2reth up himself to take hold of th2e: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities. 
But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our po2ter; and we a2l are the work of thy hand. 
Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, s2e, we bes2ech th2e, we are a2l thy people. 
Thy holy cities are a wilderne2s, Zion is a wilderne2s, Jerusalem a desolation. 
Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised th2e, is burned up with fire: and a2l our pleasant things are laid waste. 
Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and a2flict us very sore? 
I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not ca2led by my name. 
I have spread out my hands a2l the day unto a rebe2lious people, which walketh in a way that was not g2od, after their own thoughts; 
A people that provoketh me to anger continua2ly to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick; 
Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their ve2sels; 
Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth a2l the day. 
Behold, it is wri2ten before me: I wi2l not k2ep silence, but wi2l recompense, even recompense into their bosom, 
Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hi2ls: therefore wi2l I measure their former work into their bosom. 
Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a ble2sing is in it: so wi2l I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them a2l. 
And I wi2l bring forth a s2ed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect sha2l inherit it, and my servants sha2l dwe2l there. 
And Sharon sha2l be a fold of flocks, and the va2ley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me. 
But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that tr2op, and that furnish the drink o2fering unto that number. 
Therefore wi2l I number you to the sword, and ye sha2l a2l bow down to the slaughter: because when I ca2led, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did ch2ose that wherein I delighted not. 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants sha2l eat, but ye sha2l be hungry: behold, my servants sha2l drink, but ye sha2l be thirsty: behold, my servants sha2l rejoice, but ye sha2l be ashamed: 
Behold, my servants sha2l sing for joy of heart, but ye sha2l cry for so2row of heart, and sha2l howl for vexation of spirit. 
And ye sha2l leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD sha2l slay th2e, and ca2l his servants by another name: 
That he who ble2seth himself in the earth sha2l ble2s himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth sha2l swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgo2ten, and because they are hid from mine eyes. 
For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former sha2l not be remembered, nor come into mind. 
But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. 
And I wi2l rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of w2eping sha2l be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. 
There sha2l be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not fi2led his days: for the child sha2l die an hundred years old; but the si2ner being an hundred years old sha2l be a2cursed. 
And they sha2l build houses, and inhabit them; and they sha2l plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. 
They sha2l not build, and another inhabit; they sha2l not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tr2e are the days of my people, and mine elect sha2l long enjoy the work of their hands. 
They sha2l not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the s2ed of the ble2sed of the LORD, and their o2fspring with them. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that before they ca2l, I wi2l answer; and while they are yet speaking, I wi2l hear. 
The wolf and the lamb sha2l f2ed together, and the lion sha2l eat straw like the bu2lock: and dust sha2l be the serpent's meat. They sha2l not hurt nor destroy in a2l my holy mountain, saith the LORD. 
Thus saith the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my f2otst2ol: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest? 
For a2l those things hath mine hand made, and a2l those things have b2en, saith the LORD: but to this man wi2l I l2ok, even to him that is p2or and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word. 
He that ki2leth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut o2f a dog's neck; he that o2fereth an oblation, as if he o2fered swine's bl2od; he that burneth incense, as if he ble2sed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations. 
I also wi2l ch2ose their delusions, and wi2l bring their fears upon them; because when I ca2led, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not. 
Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he sha2l a2pear to your joy, and they sha2l be ashamed. 
A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies. 
Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child. 
Who hath heard such a thing? who hath s2en such things? Sha2l the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or sha2l a nation be born at once? for as s2on as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children. 
Sha2l I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD: sha2l I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy God. 
Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, a2l ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, a2l ye that mourn for her: 
That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory. 
For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I wi2l extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then sha2l ye suck, ye sha2l be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her kn2es. 
As one whom his mother comforteth, so wi2l I comfort you; and ye sha2l be comforted in Jerusalem. 
And when ye s2e this, your heart sha2l rejoice, and your bones sha2l flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD sha2l be known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies. 
For, behold, the LORD wi2l come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. 
For by fire and by his sword wi2l the LORD plead with a2l flesh: and the slain of the LORD sha2l be many. 
They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tr2e in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, sha2l be consumed together, saith the LORD. 
For I know their works and their thoughts: it sha2l come, that I wi2l gather a2l nations and tongues; and they sha2l come, and s2e my glory. 
And I wi2l set a sign among them, and I wi2l send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar o2f, that have not heard my fame, neither have s2en my glory; and they sha2l declare my glory among the Gentiles. 
And they sha2l bring a2l your brethren for an o2fering unto the LORD out of a2l nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in li2ters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an o2fering in a clean ve2sel into the house of the LORD. 
And I wi2l also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith the LORD. 
For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I wi2l make, sha2l remain before me, saith the LORD, so sha2l your s2ed and your name remain. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that from one new m2on to another, and from one sa2bath to another, sha2l a2l flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD. 
And they sha2l go forth, and l2ok upon the carcases of the men that have transgre2sed against me: for their worm sha2l not die, neither sha2l their fire be quenched; and they sha2l be an abho2ring unto a2l flesh. 
The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin: 
To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirt2enth year of his reign. 
It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the ca2rying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month. 
Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Before I formed th2e in the be2ly I knew th2e; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified th2e, and I ordained th2e a prophet unto the nations. 
Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I ca2not speak: for I am a child. 
But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to a2l that I sha2l send th2e, and whatsoever I co2mand th2e thou shalt speak. 
Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with th2e to deliver th2e, saith the LORD. 
Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth. 
S2e, I have this day set th2e over the nations and over the kingdoms, to r2ot out, and to pu2l down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant. 
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what s2est thou? And I said, I s2e a rod of an almond tr2e. 
Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast we2l s2en: for I wi2l hasten my word to perform it. 
And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, What s2est thou? And I said, I s2e a s2ething pot; and the face thereof is toward the north. 
Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil sha2l break forth upon a2l the inhabitants of the land. 
For, lo, I wi2l ca2l a2l the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the LORD; and they sha2l come, and they sha2l set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against a2l the wa2ls thereof round about, and against a2l the cities of Judah. 
And I wi2l u2ter my judgments against them touching a2l their wickedne2s, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshi2ped the works of their own hands. 
Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them a2l that I co2mand th2e: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound th2e before them. 
For, behold, I have made th2e this day a defenced city, and an iron pi2lar, and brasen wa2ls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land. 
And they sha2l fight against th2e; but they sha2l not prevail against th2e; for I am with th2e, saith the LORD, to deliver th2e. 
Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 
Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember th2e, the kindne2s of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderne2s, in a land that was not sown. 
Israel was holine2s unto the LORD, and the firstfruits of his increase: a2l that devour him sha2l o2fend; evil sha2l come upon them, saith the LORD. 
Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and a2l the families of the house of Israel: 
Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain? 
Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderne2s, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man pa2sed through, and where no man dwelt? 
And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the g2odne2s thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination. 
The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgre2sed against me, and the prophets prophesied by B2al, and walked after things that do not profit. 
Wherefore I wi2l yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your children's children wi2l I plead. 
For pa2s over the isles of Chi2tim, and s2e; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and s2e if there be such a thing. 
Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit. 
Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be ho2ribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the LORD. 
For my people have co2mi2ted two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water. 
Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he spoiled? 
The young lions roared upon him, and ye2led, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant. 
Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head. 
Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led th2e by the way? 
And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of A2syria, to drink the waters of the river? 
Thine own wickedne2s sha2l co2rect th2e, and thy backslidings sha2l reprove th2e: know therefore and s2e that it is an evil thing and bi2ter, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, and that my fear is not in th2e, saith the Lord GOD of hosts. 
For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I wi2l not transgre2s; when upon every high hi2l and under every gr2en tr2e thou wanderest, playing the harlot. 
Yet I had planted th2e a noble vine, who2ly a right s2ed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me? 
For though thou wash th2e with nitre, and take th2e much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD. 
How canst thou say, I am not po2luted, I have not gone after B2alim? s2e thy way in the va2ley, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways; 
A wild a2s used to the wilderne2s, that snu2feth up the wind at her pleasure; in her o2casion who can turn her away? a2l they that s2ek her wi2l not weary themselves; in her month they sha2l find her. 
Wit2hold thy f2ot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them wi2l I go. 
As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets. 
Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they wi2l say, Arise, and save us. 
But where are thy gods that thou hast made th2e? let them arise, if they can save th2e in the time of thy trouble: for a2cording to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah. 
Wherefore wi2l ye plead with me? ye a2l have transgre2sed against me, saith the LORD. 
In vain have I smi2ten your children; they received no co2rection: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion. 
O generation, s2e ye the word of the LORD. Have I b2en a wilderne2s unto Israel? a land of darkne2s? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we wi2l come no more unto th2e? 
Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her a2tire? yet my people have forgo2ten me days without number. 
Why tri2mest thou thy way to s2ek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways. 
Also in thy skirts is found the bl2od of the souls of the p2or i2nocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon a2l these. 
Yet thou sayest, Because I am i2nocent, surely his anger sha2l turn from me. Behold, I wi2l plead with th2e, because thou sayest, I have not si2ned. 
Why ga2dest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of A2syria. 
Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them. 
They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, sha2l he return unto her again? sha2l not that land be greatly po2luted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the LORD. 
Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and s2e where thou hast not b2en lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderne2s; and thou hast po2luted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedne2s. 
Therefore the showers have b2en wit2holden, and there hath b2en no la2ter rain; and thou hadst a whore's forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed. 
Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the guide of my youth? 
Wi2l he reserve his anger for ever? wi2l he k2ep it to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest. 
The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou s2en that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every gr2en tr2e, and there hath played the harlot. 
And I said after she had done a2l these things, Turn thou unto me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it. 
And I saw, when for a2l the causes whereby backsliding Israel co2mi2ted adultery I had put her away, and given her a bi2l of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also. 
And it came to pa2s through the lightne2s of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and co2mi2ted adultery with stones and with stocks. 
And yet for a2l this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD. 
And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah. 
Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; and I wi2l not cause mine anger to fa2l upon you: for I am merciful, saith the LORD, and I wi2l not k2ep anger for ever. 
Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgre2sed against the LORD thy God, and hast sca2tered thy ways to the strangers under every gr2en tr2e, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the LORD. 
Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am ma2ried unto you: and I wi2l take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I wi2l bring you to Zion: 
And I wi2l give you pastors a2cording to mine heart, which sha2l f2ed you with knowledge and understanding. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, when ye be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they sha2l say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither sha2l it come to mind: neither sha2l they remember it; neither sha2l they visit it; neither sha2l that be done any more. 
At that time they sha2l ca2l Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and a2l the nations sha2l be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither sha2l they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart. 
In those days the house of Judah sha2l walk with the house of Israel, and they sha2l come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers. 
But I said, How sha2l I put th2e among the children, and give th2e a pleasant land, a g2odly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, Thou shalt ca2l me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me. 
Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the LORD. 
A voice was heard upon the high places, w2eping and su2plications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they have forgo2ten the LORD their God. 
Return, ye backsliding children, and I wi2l heal your backslidings. Behold, we come unto th2e; for thou art the LORD our God. 
Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hi2ls, and from the multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel. 
For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. 
We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we have si2ned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God. 
If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return unto me: and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove. 
And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousne2s; and the nations sha2l ble2s themselves in him, and in him sha2l they glory. 
For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fa2low ground, and sow not among thorns. 
Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings. 
Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, A2semble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities. 
Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I wi2l bring evil from the north, and a great destruction. 
The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; and thy cities sha2l be laid waste, without an inhabitant. 
For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s at that day, saith the LORD, that the heart of the king sha2l perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests sha2l be astonished, and the prophets sha2l wonder. 
Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye sha2l have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul. 
At that time sha2l it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderne2s toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse, 
Even a fu2l wind from those places sha2l come unto me: now also wi2l I give sentence against them. 
Behold, he sha2l come up as clouds, and his chariots sha2l be as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are spoiled. 
O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedne2s, that thou mayest be saved. How long sha2l thy vain thoughts lodge within th2e? 
For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth a2fliction from mount Ephraim. 
Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah. 
As k2epers of a field, are they against her round about; because she hath b2en rebe2lious against me, saith the LORD. 
Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto th2e; this is thy wickedne2s, because it is bi2ter, because it reacheth unto thine heart. 
My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I ca2not hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war. 
Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled: su2denly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment. 
How long sha2l I s2e the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet? 
For my people is f2olish, they have not known me; they are so2tish children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do g2od they have no knowledge. 
I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. 
I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and a2l the hi2ls moved lightly. 
I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and a2l the birds of the heavens were fled. 
I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderne2s, and a2l the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger. 
For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land sha2l be desolate; yet wi2l I not make a fu2l end. 
For this sha2l the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and wi2l not repent, neither wi2l I turn back from it. 
The whole city sha2l fl2e for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they sha2l go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city sha2l be forsaken, and not a man dwe2l therein. 
And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest th2e with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers wi2l despise th2e, they wi2l s2ek thy life. 
For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers. 
Run ye to and fro through the str2ets of Jerusalem, and s2e now, and know, and s2ek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that executeth judgment, that s2eketh the truth; and I wi2l pardon it. 
And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely. 
O LORD, are not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive co2rection: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return. 
Therefore I said, Surely these are p2or; they are f2olish: for they know not the way of the LORD, nor the judgment of their God. 
I wi2l get me unto the great men, and wi2l speak unto them; for they have known the way of the LORD, and the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, and burst the bonds. 
Wherefore a lion out of the forest sha2l slay them, and a wolf of the evenings sha2l spoil them, a leopard sha2l watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence sha2l be torn in pieces: because their transgre2sions are many, and their backslidings are increased. 
How sha2l I pardon th2e for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the fu2l, they then co2mi2ted adultery, and a2sembled themselves by tr2ops in the harlots' houses. 
They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour's wife. 
Sha2l I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: and sha2l not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? 
Go ye up upon her wa2ls, and destroy; but make not a fu2l end: take away her ba2tlements; for they are not the LORD's. 
For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the LORD. 
They have belied the LORD, and said, It is not he; neither sha2l evil come upon us; neither sha2l we s2e sword nor famine: 
And the prophets sha2l become wind, and the word is not in them: thus sha2l it be done unto them. 
Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I wi2l make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people w2od, and it sha2l devour them. 
Lo, I wi2l bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the LORD: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say. 
Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are a2l mighty men. 
And they sha2l eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they sha2l eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they sha2l eat up thy vines and thy fig tr2es: they sha2l impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword. 
Neverthele2s in those days, saith the LORD, I wi2l not make a fu2l end with you. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, when ye sha2l say, Wherefore doeth the LORD our God a2l these things unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so sha2l ye serve strangers in a land that is not your's. 
Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying, 
Hear now this, O f2olish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and s2e not; which have ears, and hear not: 
Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: wi2l ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decr2e, that it ca2not pa2s it: and though the waves thereof to2s themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pa2s over it? 
But this people hath a revolting and a rebe2lious heart; they are revolted and gone. 
Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the la2ter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the a2pointed w2eks of the harvest. 
Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have wit2holden g2od things from you. 
For among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he that se2teth snares; they set a trap, they catch men. 
As a cage is fu2l of birds, so are their houses fu2l of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich. 
They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpa2s the d2eds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherle2s, yet they prosper; and the right of the n2edy do they not judge. 
Sha2l I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: sha2l not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? 
A wonderful and ho2rible thing is co2mi2ted in the land; 
The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what wi2l ye do in the end thereof? 
O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to fl2e out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Bet2ha2cerem: for evil a2peareth out of the north, and great destruction. 
I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman. 
The shepherds with their flocks sha2l come unto her; they sha2l pitch their tents against her round about; they sha2l f2ed every one in his place. 
Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at n2on. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out. 
Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces. 
For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down tr2es, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is who2ly o2pre2sion in the midst of her. 
As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedne2s: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continua2ly is grief and wounds. 
Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from th2e; lest I make th2e desolate, a land not inhabited. 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They sha2l throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets. 
To whom sha2l I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they ca2not hearken: behold, the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it. 
Therefore I am fu2l of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: I wi2l pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the a2sembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife sha2l be taken, the aged with him that is fu2l of days. 
And their houses sha2l be turned unto others, with their fields and wives together: for I wi2l stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD. 
For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousne2s; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. 
They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. 
Were they ashamed when they had co2mi2ted abomination? nay, they were not at a2l ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they sha2l fa2l among them that fa2l: at the time that I visit them they sha2l be cast down, saith the LORD. 
Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and s2e, and ask for the old paths, where is the g2od way, and walk therein, and ye sha2l find rest for your souls. But they said, We wi2l not walk therein. 
Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We wi2l not hearken. 
Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them. 
Hear, O earth: behold, I wi2l bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it. 
To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sw2et cane from a far country? your burnt o2ferings are not a2ceptable, nor your sacrifices sw2et unto me. 
Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I wi2l lay stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together sha2l fa2l upon them; the neighbour and his friend sha2l perish. 
Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation sha2l be raised from the sides of the earth. 
They sha2l lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in a2ray as men for war against th2e, O daughter of Zion. 
We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax f2eble: anguish hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail. 
Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side. 
O daughter of my people, gird th2e with sackcloth, and wa2low thyself in ashes: make th2e mourning, as for an only son, most bi2ter lamentation: for the spoiler sha2l su2denly come upon us. 
I have set th2e for a tower and a fortre2s among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way. 
They are a2l grievous revolters, walking with slanders: they are bra2s and iron; they are a2l co2rupters. 
The be2lows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away. 
Reprobate silver sha2l men ca2l them, because the LORD hath rejected them. 
The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 
Stand in the gate of the LORD's house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, a2l ye of Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship the LORD. 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I wi2l cause you to dwe2l in this place. 
Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, are these. 
For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye throughly execute judgment betw2en a man and his neighbour; 
If ye o2pre2s not the stranger, the fatherle2s, and the widow, and shed not i2nocent bl2od in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt: 
Then wi2l I cause you to dwe2l in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever. 
Behold, ye trust in lying words, that ca2not profit. 
Wi2l ye steal, murder, and co2mit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto B2al, and walk after other gods whom ye know not; 
And come and stand before me in this house, which is ca2led by my name, and say, We are delivered to do a2l these abominations? 
Is this house, which is ca2led by my name, become a den of ro2bers in your eyes? Behold, even I have s2en it, saith the LORD. 
But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and s2e what I did to it for the wickedne2s of my people Israel. 
And now, because ye have done a2l these works, saith the LORD, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I ca2led you, but ye answered not; 
Therefore wi2l I do unto this house, which is ca2led by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh. 
And I wi2l cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out a2l your brethren, even the whole s2ed of Ephraim. 
Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make interce2sion to me: for I wi2l not hear th2e. 
S2est thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the str2ets of Jerusalem? 
The children gather w2od, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the qu2en of heaven, and to pour out drink o2ferings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger. 
Do they provoke me to anger? saith the LORD: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces? 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, mine anger and my fury sha2l be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the tr2es of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it sha2l burn, and sha2l not be quenched. 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt o2ferings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh. 
For I spake not unto your fathers, nor co2manded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt o2ferings or sacrifices: 
But this thing co2manded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I wi2l be your God, and ye sha2l be my people: and walk ye in a2l the ways that I have co2manded you, that it may be we2l unto you. 
But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward. 
Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you a2l my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them: 
Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers. 
Therefore thou shalt speak a2l these words unto them; but they wi2l not hearken to th2e: thou shalt also ca2l unto them; but they wi2l not answer th2e. 
But thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth co2rection: truth is perished, and is cut o2f from their mouth. 
Cut o2f thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath. 
For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is ca2led by my name, to po2lute it. 
And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the va2ley of the son of Hi2nom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I co2manded them not, neither came it into my heart. 
Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it sha2l no more be ca2led Tophet, nor the va2ley of the son of Hi2nom, but the va2ley of slaughter: for they sha2l bury in Tophet, ti2l there be no place. 
And the carcases of this people sha2l be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none sha2l fray them away. 
Then wi2l I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the str2ets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladne2s, the voice of the bridegr2om, and the voice of the bride: for the land sha2l be desolate. 
At that time, saith the LORD, they sha2l bring out the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves: 
And they sha2l spread them before the sun, and the m2on, and a2l the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshi2ped: they sha2l not be gathered, nor be buried; they sha2l be for dung upon the face of the earth. 
And death sha2l be chosen rather than life by a2l the residue of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in a2l the places whither I have driven them, saith the LORD of hosts. 
Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Sha2l they fa2l, and not arise? sha2l he turn away, and not return? 
Why then is this people of Jerusalem sli2den back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return. 
I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented him of his wickedne2s, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth into the ba2tle. 
Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her a2pointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swa2low observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD. 
How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in vain. 
The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them? 
Therefore wi2l I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that sha2l inherit them: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousne2s, from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. 
For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. 
Were they ashamed when they had co2mi2ted abomination? nay, they were not at a2l ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore sha2l they fa2l among them that fa2l: in the time of their visitation they sha2l be cast down, saith the LORD. 
I wi2l surely consume them, saith the LORD: there sha2l be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tr2e, and the leaf sha2l fade; and the things that I have given them sha2l pa2s away from them. 
Why do we sit sti2l? a2semble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of ga2l to drink, because we have si2ned against the LORD. 
We l2oked for peace, but no g2od came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble! 
The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and a2l that is in it; the city, and those that dwe2l therein. 
For, behold, I wi2l send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which wi2l not be charmed, and they sha2l bite you, saith the LORD. 
When I would comfort myself against so2row, my heart is faint in me. 
Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwe2l in a far country: Is not the LORD in Zion? is not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with strange vanities? 
The harvest is past, the su2mer is ended, and we are not saved. 
For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me. 
Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered? 
Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might w2ep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people! 
Oh that I had in the wilderne2s a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they be a2l adulterers, an a2sembly of treacherous men. 
And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proc2ed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD. 
Take ye h2ed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother wi2l u2terly su2plant, and every neighbour wi2l walk with slanders. 
And they wi2l deceive every one his neighbour, and wi2l not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary themselves to co2mit iniquity. 
Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD. 
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I wi2l melt them, and try them; for how sha2l I do for the daughter of my people? 
Their tongue is as an a2row shot out; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait. 
Sha2l I not visit them for these things? saith the LORD: sha2l not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? 
For the mountains wi2l I take up a w2eping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderne2s a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pa2s through them; neither can men hear the voice of the ca2tle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone. 
And I wi2l make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I wi2l make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant. 
Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderne2s, that none pa2seth through? 
And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein; 
But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after B2alim, which their fathers taught them: 
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I wi2l f2ed them, even this people, with wormw2od, and give them water of ga2l to drink. 
I wi2l sca2ter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I wi2l send a sword after them, ti2l I have consumed them. 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and ca2l for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cu2ning women, that they may come: 
And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters. 
For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwe2lings have cast us out. 
Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation. 
For death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our palaces, to cut o2f the children from without, and the young men from the str2ets. 
Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men sha2l fa2l as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none sha2l gather them. 
Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: 
But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindne2s, judgment, and righteousne2s, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the LORD. 
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I wi2l punish a2l them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised; 
Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of A2mon, and Moab, and a2l that are in the utmost corners, that dwe2l in the wilderne2s: for a2l these nations are uncircumcised, and a2l the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart. 
Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel: 
Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them. 
For the customs of the people are vain: for one cu2teth a tr2e out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe. 
They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with ha2mers, that it move not. 
They are upright as the palm tr2e, but speak not: they must n2eds be borne, because they ca2not go. Be not afraid of them; for they ca2not do evil, neither also is it in them to do g2od. 
Forasmuch as there is none like unto th2e, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might. 
Who would not fear th2e, O King of nations? for to th2e doth it a2pertain: forasmuch as among a2l the wise men of the nations, and in a2l their kingdoms, there is none like unto th2e. 
But they are altogether brutish and f2olish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities. 
Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are a2l the work of cu2ning men. 
But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth sha2l tremble, and the nations sha2l not be able to abide his indignation. 
Thus sha2l ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they sha2l perish from the earth, and from under these heavens. 
He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion. 
When he u2tereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures. 
Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falseh2od, and there is no breath in them. 
They are vanity, and the work of e2rors: in the time of their visitation they sha2l perish. 
The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of a2l things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name. 
Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortre2s. 
For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I wi2l sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and wi2l distre2s them, that they may find it so. 
Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous; but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it. 
My tabernacle is spoiled, and a2l my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains. 
For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they sha2l not prosper, and a2l their flocks sha2l be sca2tered. 
Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great co2motion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons. 
O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps. 
O LORD, co2rect me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing. 
Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know th2e not, and upon the families that ca2l not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate. 
The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD saying, 
Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem; 
And say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant, 
Which I co2manded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, a2cording to a2l which I co2mand you: so sha2l ye be my people, and I wi2l be your God: 
That I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD. 
Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim a2l these words in the cities of Judah, and in the str2ets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them. 
For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice. 
Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I wi2l bring upon them a2l the words of this covenant, which I co2manded them to do: but they did them not. 
And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers. 
Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I wi2l bring evil upon them, which they sha2l not be able to escape; and though they sha2l cry unto me, I wi2l not hearken unto them. 
Then sha2l the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they o2fer incense: but they sha2l not save them at a2l in the time of their trouble. 
For a2cording to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and a2cording to the number of the str2ets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto B2al. 
Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I wi2l not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble. 
What hath my beloved to do in mine house, s2eing she hath wrought lewdne2s with many, and the holy flesh is pa2sed from th2e? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest. 
The LORD ca2led thy name, A gr2en olive tr2e, fair, and of g2odly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken. 
For the LORD of hosts, that planted th2e, hath pronounced evil against th2e, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in o2fering incense unto B2al. 
And the LORD hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then thou shewedst me their doings. 
But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tr2e with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him o2f from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered. 
But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me s2e thy vengeance on them: for unto th2e have I revealed my cause. 
Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that s2ek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that thou die not by our hand: 
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I wi2l punish them: the young men sha2l die by the sword; their sons and their daughters sha2l die by famine: 
And there sha2l be no remnant of them: for I wi2l bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation. 
Righteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with th2e: yet let me talk with th2e of thy judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are a2l they ha2py that deal very treacherously? 
Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken r2ot: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins. 
But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast s2en me, and tried mine heart toward th2e: pu2l them out like sh2ep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter. 
How long sha2l the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedne2s of them that dwe2l therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He sha2l not s2e our last end. 
If thou hast run with the f2otmen, and they have wearied th2e, then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, wherein thou trustedst, they wearied th2e, then how wilt thou do in the swe2ling of Jordan? 
For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with th2e; yea, they have ca2led a multitude after th2e: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto th2e. 
I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies. 
Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it. 
Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round about are against her; come ye, a2semble a2l the beasts of the field, come to devour. 
Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have tro2den my portion under f2ot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderne2s. 
They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart. 
The spoilers are come upon a2l high places through the wilderne2s: for the sword of the LORD sha2l devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh sha2l have peace. 
They have sown wheat, but sha2l reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, but sha2l not profit: and they sha2l be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD. 
Thus saith the LORD against a2l mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I wi2l pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, after that I have plucked them out I wi2l return, and have compa2sion on them, and wi2l bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, if they wi2l diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to swear by B2al; then sha2l they be built in the midst of my people. 
But if they wi2l not obey, I wi2l u2terly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the LORD. 
Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get th2e a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water. 
So I got a girdle a2cording to the word of the LORD, and put it on my loins. 
And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, 
Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock. 
So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD co2manded me. 
And it came to pa2s after many days, that the LORD said unto me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I co2manded th2e to hide there. 
Then I went to Euphrates, and di2ged, and t2ok the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was ma2red, it was profitable for nothing. 
Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Thus saith the LORD, After this ma2ner wi2l I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem. 
This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, sha2l even be as this girdle, which is g2od for nothing. 
For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the LORD; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear. 
Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Every bo2tle sha2l be fi2led with wine: and they sha2l say unto th2e, Do we not certainly know that every bo2tle sha2l be fi2led with wine? 
Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I wi2l fi2l a2l the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and a2l the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunke2ne2s. 
And I wi2l dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the LORD: I wi2l not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them. 
Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken. 
Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkne2s, and before your f2et stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye l2ok for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gro2s darkne2s. 
But if ye wi2l not hear it, my soul sha2l w2ep in secret places for your pride; and mine eye sha2l w2ep sore, and run down with tears, because the LORD's flock is ca2ried away captive. 
Say unto the king and to the qu2en, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities sha2l come down, even the crown of your glory. 
The cities of the south sha2l be shut up, and none sha2l open them: Judah sha2l be ca2ried away captive a2l of it, it sha2l be who2ly ca2ried away captive. 
Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given th2e, thy beautiful flock? 
What wilt thou say when he sha2l punish th2e? for thou hast taught them to be captains, and as chief over th2e: sha2l not so2rows take th2e, as a woman in travail? 
And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For the greatne2s of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy h2els made bare. 
Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do g2od, that are a2customed to do evil. 
Therefore wi2l I sca2ter them as the stu2ble that pa2seth away by the wind of the wilderne2s. 
This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the LORD; because thou hast forgo2ten me, and trusted in falseh2od. 
Therefore wi2l I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may a2pear. 
I have s2en thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdne2s of thy whoredom, and thine abominations on the hi2ls in the fields. Woe unto th2e, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when sha2l it once be? 
The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth. 
Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up. 
And their nobles have sent their li2tle ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their ve2sels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads. 
Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads. 
Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and fors2ok it, because there was no gra2s. 
And the wild a2ses did stand in the high places, they snu2fed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there was no gra2s. 
O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have si2ned against th2e. 
O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to ta2ry for a night? 
Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that ca2not save? yet thou, O LORD, art in the midst of us, and we are ca2led by thy name; leave us not. 
Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not refrained their f2et, therefore the LORD doth not a2cept them; he wi2l now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins. 
Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for their g2od. 
When they fast, I wi2l not hear their cry; and when they o2fer burnt o2fering and an oblation, I wi2l not a2cept them: but I wi2l consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence. 
Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye sha2l not s2e the sword, neither sha2l ye have famine; but I wi2l give you a2sured peace in this place. 
Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I co2manded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart. 
Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine sha2l not be in this land; By sword and famine sha2l those prophets be consumed. 
And the people to whom they prophesy sha2l be cast out in the str2ets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they sha2l have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I wi2l pour their wickedne2s upon them. 
Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow. 
If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not. 
Hast thou u2terly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast thou smi2ten us, and there is no healing for us? we l2oked for peace, and there is no g2od; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble! 
We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedne2s, and the iniquity of our fathers: for we have si2ned against th2e. 
Do not abhor us, for thy name's sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us. 
Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we wi2l wait upon th2e: for thou hast made a2l these things. 
Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel st2od before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, if they say unto th2e, Whither sha2l we go forth? then thou shalt te2l them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity. 
And I wi2l a2point over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy. 
And I wi2l cause them to be removed into a2l kingdoms of the earth, because of Mana2seh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem. 
For who sha2l have pity upon th2e, O Jerusalem? or who sha2l bemoan th2e? or who sha2l go aside to ask how thou doest? 
Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore wi2l I stretch out my hand against th2e, and destroy th2e; I am weary with repenting. 
And I wi2l fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I wi2l bereave them of children, I wi2l destroy my people since they return not from their ways. 
Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at n2onday: I have caused him to fa2l upon it su2denly, and te2rors upon the city. 
She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she hath b2en ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them wi2l I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD. 
Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them doth curse me. 
The LORD said, Verily it sha2l be we2l with thy remnant; verily I wi2l cause the enemy to entreat th2e we2l in the time of evil and in the time of a2fliction. 
Sha2l iron break the northern iron and the st2el? 
Thy substance and thy treasures wi2l I give to the spoil without price, and that for a2l thy sins, even in a2l thy borders. 
And I wi2l make th2e to pa2s with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which sha2l burn upon you. 
O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsu2fering: know that for thy sake I have su2fered rebuke. 
Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am ca2led by thy name, O LORD God of hosts. 
I sat not in the a2sembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast fi2led me with indignation. 
Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, and as waters that fail? 
Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then wi2l I bring th2e again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto th2e; but return not thou unto them. 
And I wi2l make th2e unto this people a fenced brasen wa2l: and they sha2l fight against th2e, but they sha2l not prevail against th2e: for I am with th2e to save th2e and to deliver th2e, saith the LORD. 
And I wi2l deliver th2e out of the hand of the wicked, and I wi2l red2em th2e out of the hand of the te2rible. 
The word of the LORD came also unto me, saying, 
Thou shalt not take th2e a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place. 
For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land; 
They sha2l die of grievous deaths; they sha2l not be lamented; neither sha2l they be buried; but they sha2l be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they sha2l be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcases sha2l be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth. 
For thus saith the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith the LORD, even lovingkindne2s and mercies. 
Both the great and the sma2l sha2l die in this land: they sha2l not be buried, neither sha2l men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them: 
Neither sha2l men tear themselves for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither sha2l men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother. 
Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink. 
For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I wi2l cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladne2s, the voice of the bridegr2om, and the voice of the bride. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, when thou shalt shew this people a2l these words, and they sha2l say unto th2e, Wherefore hath the LORD pronounced a2l this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have co2mi2ted against the LORD our God? 
Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshi2ped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law; 
And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me: 
Therefore wi2l I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not, neither ye nor your fathers; and there sha2l ye serve other gods day and night; where I wi2l not shew you favour. 
Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it sha2l no more be said, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; 
But, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from a2l the lands whither he had driven them: and I wi2l bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers. 
Behold, I wi2l send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they sha2l fish them; and after wi2l I send for many hunters, and they sha2l hunt them from every mountain, and from every hi2l, and out of the holes of the rocks. 
For mine eyes are upon a2l their ways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes. 
And first I wi2l recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have fi2led mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things. 
O LORD, my strength, and my fortre2s, and my refuge in the day of a2fliction, the Gentiles sha2l come unto th2e from the ends of the earth, and sha2l say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit. 
Sha2l a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods? 
Therefore, behold, I wi2l this once cause them to know, I wi2l cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they sha2l know that my name is The LORD. 
The sin of Judah is wri2ten with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond: it is graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars; 
Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the gr2en tr2es upon the high hi2ls. 
O my mountain in the field, I wi2l give thy substance and a2l thy treasures to the spoil, and thy high places for sin, throughout a2l thy borders. 
And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave th2e; and I wi2l cause th2e to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, which sha2l burn for ever. 
Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD. 
For he sha2l be like the heath in the desert, and sha2l not s2e when g2od cometh; but sha2l inhabit the parched places in the wilderne2s, in a salt land and not inhabited. 
Ble2sed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is. 
For he sha2l be as a tr2e planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her r2ots by the river, and sha2l not s2e when heat cometh, but her leaf sha2l be gr2en; and sha2l not be careful in the year of drought, neither sha2l cease from yielding fruit. 
The heart is deceitful above a2l things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? 
I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man a2cording to his ways, and a2cording to the fruit of his doings. 
As the partridge si2teth on e2gs, and hatcheth them not; so he that ge2teth riches, and not by right, sha2l leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end sha2l be a f2ol. 
A glorious high throne from the begi2ning is the place of our sanctuary. 
O LORD, the hope of Israel, a2l that forsake th2e sha2l be ashamed, and they that depart from me sha2l be wri2ten in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters. 
Heal me, O LORD, and I sha2l be healed; save me, and I sha2l be saved: for thou art my praise. 
Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the LORD? let it come now. 
As for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to fo2low th2e: neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which came out of my lips was right before th2e. 
Be not a te2ror unto me: thou art my hope in the day of evil. 
Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction. 
Thus said the LORD unto me; Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by the which they go out, and in a2l the gates of Jerusalem; 
And say unto them, Hear ye the word of the LORD, ye kings of Judah, and a2l Judah, and a2l the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates: 
Thus saith the LORD; Take h2ed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sa2bath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem; 
Neither ca2ry forth a burden out of your houses on the sa2bath day, neither do ye any work, but ha2low ye the sa2bath day, as I co2manded your fathers. 
But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck sti2f, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sa2bath day, but ha2low the sa2bath day, to do no work therein; 
Then sha2l there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes si2ting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city sha2l remain for ever. 
And they sha2l come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt o2ferings, and sacrifices, and meat o2ferings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the LORD. 
But if ye wi2l not hearken unto me to ha2low the sa2bath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sa2bath day; then wi2l I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it sha2l devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it sha2l not be quenched. 
The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 
Arise, and go down to the po2ter's house, and there I wi2l cause th2e to hear my words. 
Then I went down to the po2ter's house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wh2els. 
And the ve2sel that he made of clay was ma2red in the hand of the po2ter: so he made it again another ve2sel, as s2emed g2od to the po2ter to make it. 
Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 
O house of Israel, ca2not I do with you as this po2ter? saith the LORD. Behold, as the clay is in the po2ter's hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel. 
At what instant I sha2l speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pu2l down, and to destroy it; 
If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I wi2l repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. 
And at what instant I sha2l speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; 
If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I wi2l repent of the g2od, wherewith I said I would benefit them. 
Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings g2od. 
And they said, There is no hope: but we wi2l walk after our own devices, and we wi2l every one do the imagination of his evil heart. 
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen, who hath heard such things: the virgin of Israel hath done a very ho2rible thing. 
Wi2l a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock of the field? or sha2l the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken? 
Because my people hath forgo2ten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up; 
To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hi2sing; every one that pa2seth thereby sha2l be astonished, and wag his head. 
I wi2l sca2ter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I wi2l shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity. 
Then said they, Come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law sha2l not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give h2ed to any of his words. 
Give h2ed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me. 
Sha2l evil be recompensed for g2od? for they have di2ged a pit for my soul. Remember that I st2od before th2e to speak g2od for them, and to turn away thy wrath from them. 
Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their bl2od by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and be widows; and let their men be put to death; let their young men be slain by the sword in ba2tle. 
Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a tr2op su2denly upon them: for they have di2ged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my f2et. 
Yet, LORD, thou knowest a2l their counsel against me to slay me: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before th2e; deal thus with them in the time of thine anger. 
Thus saith the LORD, Go and get a po2ter's earthen bo2tle, and take of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests; 
And go forth unto the va2ley of the son of Hi2nom, which is by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I sha2l te2l th2e, 
And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I wi2l bring evil upon this place, the which whosoever heareth, his ears sha2l tingle. 
Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have fi2led this place with the bl2od of i2nocents; 
They have built also the high places of B2al, to burn their sons with fire for burnt o2ferings unto B2al, which I co2manded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind: 
Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place sha2l no more be ca2led Tophet, nor The va2ley of the son of Hi2nom, but The va2ley of slaughter. 
And I wi2l make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I wi2l cause them to fa2l by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that s2ek their lives: and their carcases wi2l I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth. 
And I wi2l make this city desolate, and an hi2sing; every one that pa2seth thereby sha2l be astonished and hi2s because of a2l the plagues thereof. 
And I wi2l cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they sha2l eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitne2s, wherewith their enemies, and they that s2ek their lives, sha2l straiten them. 
Then shalt thou break the bo2tle in the sight of the men that go with th2e, 
And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Even so wi2l I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a po2ter's ve2sel, that ca2not be made whole again: and they sha2l bury them in Tophet, ti2l there be no place to bury. 
Thus wi2l I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the inhabitants thereof, and even make this city as Tophet: 
And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, sha2l be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of a2l the houses upon whose r2ofs they have burned incense unto a2l the host of heaven, and have poured out drink o2ferings unto other gods. 
Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he st2od in the court of the LORD's house; and said to a2l the people, 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I wi2l bring upon this city and upon a2l her towns a2l the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words. 
Now Pashur the son of I2mer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things. 
Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD. 
And it came to pa2s on the mo2row, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The LORD hath not ca2led thy name Pashur, but Magormi2sabib. 
For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I wi2l make th2e a te2ror to thyself, and to a2l thy friends: and they sha2l fa2l by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes sha2l behold it: and I wi2l give a2l Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he sha2l ca2ry them captive into Babylon, and sha2l slay them with the sword. 
Moreover I wi2l deliver a2l the strength of this city, and a2l the labours thereof, and a2l the precious things thereof, and a2l the treasures of the kings of Judah wi2l I give into the hand of their enemies, which sha2l spoil them, and take them, and ca2ry them to Babylon. 
And thou, Pashur, and a2l that dwe2l in thine house sha2l go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and a2l thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies. 
O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived; thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me. 
For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily. 
Then I said, I wi2l not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay. 
For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say they, and we wi2l report it. A2l my familiars watched for my halting, saying, Peradventure he wi2l be enticed, and we sha2l prevail against him, and we sha2l take our revenge on him. 
But the LORD is with me as a mighty te2rible one: therefore my persecutors sha2l stumble, and they sha2l not prevail: they sha2l be greatly ashamed; for they sha2l not prosper: their everlasting confusion sha2l never be forgo2ten. 
But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, and s2est the reins and the heart, let me s2e thy vengeance on them: for unto th2e have I opened my cause. 
Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered the soul of the p2or from the hand of evildoers. 
Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be ble2sed. 
Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto th2e; making him very glad. 
And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at n2ontide; 
Because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have b2en my grave, and her womb to be always great with me. 
Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to s2e labour and so2row, that my days should be consumed with shame? 
The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of M2aseiah the priest, saying, 
Enquire, I pray th2e, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that the LORD wi2l deal with us a2cording to a2l his wondrous works, that he may go up from us. 
Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus sha2l ye say to Zedekiah: 
Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I wi2l turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the wa2ls, and I wi2l a2semble them into the midst of this city. 
And I myself wi2l fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath. 
And I wi2l smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they sha2l die of a great pestilence. 
And afterward, saith the LORD, I wi2l deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that s2ek their life: and he sha2l smite them with the edge of the sword; he sha2l not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy. 
And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death. 
He that abideth in this city sha2l die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and fa2leth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he sha2l live, and his life sha2l be unto him for a prey. 
For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for g2od, saith the LORD: it sha2l be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he sha2l burn it with fire. 
And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the word of the LORD; 
O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the o2pre2sor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings. 
Behold, I am against th2e, O inhabitant of the va2ley, and rock of the plain, saith the LORD; which say, Who sha2l come down against us? or who sha2l enter into our habitations? 
But I wi2l punish you a2cording to the fruit of your doings, saith the LORD: and I wi2l kindle a fire in the forest thereof, and it sha2l devour a2l things round about it. 
Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word, 
And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, that si2test upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates: 
Thus saith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and righteousne2s, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the o2pre2sor: and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherle2s, nor the widow, neither shed i2nocent bl2od in this place. 
For if ye do this thing ind2ed, then sha2l there enter in by the gates of this house kings si2ting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people. 
But if ye wi2l not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the LORD, that this house sha2l become a desolation. 
For thus saith the LORD unto the king's house of Judah; Thou art Gilead unto me, and the head of Lebanon: yet surely I wi2l make th2e a wilderne2s, and cities which are not inhabited. 
And I wi2l prepare destroyers against th2e, every one with his weapons: and they sha2l cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire. 
And many nations sha2l pa2s by this city, and they sha2l say every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this great city? 
Then they sha2l answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshi2ped other gods, and served them. 
W2ep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but w2ep sore for him that goeth away: for he sha2l return no more, nor s2e his native country. 
For thus saith the LORD touching Sha2lum the son of Josiah king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which went forth out of this place; He sha2l not return thither any more: 
But he sha2l die in the place whither they have led him captive, and sha2l s2e this land no more. 
Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousne2s, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour's service without wages, and giveth him not for his work; 
That saith, I wi2l build me a wide house and large chambers, and cu2teth him out windows; and it is cieled with cedar, and painted with vermilion. 
Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was we2l with him? 
He judged the cause of the p2or and n2edy; then it was we2l with him: was not this to know me? saith the LORD. 
But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousne2s, and for to shed i2nocent bl2od, and for o2pre2sion, and for violence, to do it. 
Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They sha2l not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they sha2l not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory! 
He sha2l be buried with the burial of an a2s, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem. 
Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from the pa2sages: for a2l thy lovers are destroyed. 
I spake unto th2e in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I wi2l not hear. This hath b2en thy ma2ner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice. 
The wind sha2l eat up a2l thy pastors, and thy lovers sha2l go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for a2l thy wickedne2s. 
O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon th2e, the pain as of a woman in travail! 
As I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck th2e thence; 
And I wi2l give th2e into the hand of them that s2ek thy life, and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans. 
And I wi2l cast th2e out, and thy mother that bare th2e, into another country, where ye were not born; and there sha2l ye die. 
But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither sha2l they not return. 
Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a ve2sel wherein is no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his s2ed, and are cast into a land which they know not? 
O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD. 
Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childle2s, a man that sha2l not prosper in his days: for no man of his s2ed sha2l prosper, si2ting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah. 
Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and sca2ter the sh2ep of my pasture! saith the LORD. 
Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors that f2ed my people; Ye have sca2tered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I wi2l visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the LORD. 
And I wi2l gather the remnant of my flock out of a2l countries whither I have driven them, and wi2l bring them again to their folds; and they sha2l be fruitful and increase. 
And I wi2l set up shepherds over them which sha2l f2ed them: and they sha2l fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither sha2l they be lacking, saith the LORD. 
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I wi2l raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King sha2l reign and prosper, and sha2l execute judgment and justice in the earth. 
In his days Judah sha2l be saved, and Israel sha2l dwe2l safely: and this is his name whereby he sha2l be ca2led, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNE2S. 
Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they sha2l no more say, The LORD liveth, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; 
But, The LORD liveth, which brought up and which led the s2ed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from a2l countries whither I had driven them; and they sha2l dwe2l in their own land. 
Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; a2l my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holine2s. 
For the land is fu2l of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderne2s are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force is not right. 
For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedne2s, saith the LORD. 
Wherefore their way sha2l be unto them as sli2pery ways in the darkne2s: they sha2l be driven on, and fa2l therein: for I wi2l bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith the LORD. 
And I have s2en fo2ly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in B2al, and caused my people Israel to e2r. 
I have s2en also in the prophets of Jerusalem an ho2rible thing: they co2mit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedne2s; they are a2l of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomo2rah. 
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I wi2l f2ed them with wormw2od, and make them drink the water of ga2l: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profanene2s gone forth into a2l the land. 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the LORD. 
They say sti2l unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye sha2l have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil sha2l come upon you. 
For who hath st2od in the counsel of the LORD, and hath perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard it? 
Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it sha2l fa2l grievously upon the head of the wicked. 
The anger of the LORD sha2l not return, until he have executed, and ti2l he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the la2ter days ye sha2l consider it perfectly. 
I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied. 
But if they had st2od in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings. 
Am I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar o2f? 
Can any hide himself in secret places that I sha2l not s2e him? saith the LORD. Do not I fi2l heaven and earth? saith the LORD. 
I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed. 
How long sha2l this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart; 
Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they te2l every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgo2ten my name for B2al. 
The prophet that hath a dream, let him te2l a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfu2ly. What is the cha2f to the wheat? saith the LORD. 
Is not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a ha2mer that breaketh the rock in pieces? 
Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that steal my words every one from his neighbour. 
Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He saith. 
Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the LORD, and do te2l them, and cause my people to e2r by their lies, and by their lightne2s; yet I sent them not, nor co2manded them: therefore they sha2l not profit this people at a2l, saith the LORD. 
And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, sha2l ask th2e, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? thou shalt then say unto them, What burden? I wi2l even forsake you, saith the LORD. 
And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that sha2l say, The burden of the LORD, I wi2l even punish that man and his house. 
Thus sha2l ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the LORD spoken? 
And the burden of the LORD sha2l ye mention no more: for every man's word sha2l be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God. 
Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered th2e? and, What hath the LORD spoken? 
But since ye say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus saith the LORD; Because ye say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye sha2l not say, The burden of the LORD; 
Therefore, behold, I, even I, wi2l u2terly forget you, and I wi2l forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence: 
And I wi2l bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which sha2l not be forgo2ten. 
The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon had ca2ried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon. 
One basket had very g2od figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad. 
Then said the LORD unto me, What s2est thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the g2od figs, very g2od; and the evil, very evil, that ca2not be eaten, they are so evil. 
Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these g2od figs, so wi2l I acknowledge them that are ca2ried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their g2od. 
For I wi2l set mine eyes upon them for g2od, and I wi2l bring them again to this land: and I wi2l build them, and not pu2l them down; and I wi2l plant them, and not pluck them up. 
And I wi2l give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and they sha2l be my people, and I wi2l be their God: for they sha2l return unto me with their whole heart. 
And as the evil figs, which ca2not be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith the LORD, So wi2l I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwe2l in the land of Egypt: 
And I wi2l deliver them to be removed into a2l the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in a2l places whither I sha2l drive them. 
And I wi2l send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, ti2l they be consumed from o2f the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers. 
The word that came to Jeremiah concerning a2l the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon; 
The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto a2l the people of Judah, and to a2l the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, 
From the thirt2enth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, that is the thr2e and twentieth year, the word of the LORD hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened. 
And the LORD hath sent unto you a2l his servants the prophets, rising early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear. 
They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwe2l in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever: 
And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I wi2l do you no hurt. 
Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the LORD; that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt. 
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not heard my words, 
Behold, I wi2l send and take a2l the families of the north, saith the LORD, and Nebuchadre2zar the king of Babylon, my servant, and wi2l bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against a2l these nations round about, and wi2l u2terly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hi2sing, and perpetual desolations. 
Moreover I wi2l take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladne2s, the voice of the bridegr2om, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the mi2lstones, and the light of the candle. 
And this whole land sha2l be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations sha2l serve the king of Babylon seventy years. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, when seventy years are a2complished, that I wi2l punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and wi2l make it perpetual desolations. 
And I wi2l bring upon that land a2l my words which I have pronounced against it, even a2l that is wri2ten in this b2ok, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against a2l the nations. 
For many nations and great kings sha2l serve themselves of them also: and I wi2l recompense them a2cording to their d2eds, and a2cording to the works of their own hands. 
For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause a2l the nations, to whom I send th2e, to drink it. 
And they sha2l drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I wi2l send among them. 
Then t2ok I the cup at the LORD's hand, and made a2l the nations to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me: 
To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hi2sing, and a curse; as it is this day; 
Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and a2l his people; 
And a2l the mingled people, and a2l the kings of the land of Uz, and a2l the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and A2zah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod, 
Edom, and Moab, and the children of A2mon, 
And a2l the kings of Tyrus, and a2l the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea, 
Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and a2l that are in the utmost corners, 
And a2l the kings of Arabia, and a2l the kings of the mingled people that dwe2l in the desert, 
And a2l the kings of Zimri, and a2l the kings of Elam, and a2l the kings of the Medes, 
And a2l the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and a2l the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach sha2l drink after them. 
Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fa2l, and rise no more, because of the sword which I wi2l send among you. 
And it sha2l be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ye sha2l certainly drink. 
For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is ca2led by my name, and should ye be u2terly unpunished? Ye sha2l not be unpunished: for I wi2l ca2l for a sword upon a2l the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts. 
Therefore prophesy thou against them a2l these words, and say unto them, The LORD sha2l roar from on high, and u2ter his voice from his holy habitation; he sha2l mightily roar upon his habitation; he sha2l give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against a2l the inhabitants of the earth. 
A noise sha2l come even to the ends of the earth; for the LORD hath a controversy with the nations, he wi2l plead with a2l flesh; he wi2l give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the LORD. 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil sha2l go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind sha2l be raised up from the coasts of the earth. 
And the slain of the LORD sha2l be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they sha2l not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they sha2l be dung upon the ground. 
Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wa2low yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are a2complished; and ye sha2l fa2l like a pleasant ve2sel. 
And the shepherds sha2l have no way to fl2e, nor the principal of the flock to escape. 
A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, sha2l be heard: for the LORD hath spoiled their pasture. 
And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the LORD. 
He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fiercene2s of the o2pre2sor, and because of his fierce anger. 
In the begi2ning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying, 
Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD's house, and speak unto a2l the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD's house, a2l the words that I co2mand th2e to speak unto them; diminish not a word: 
If so be they wi2l hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings. 
And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye wi2l not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you, 
To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto you, both rising up early, and sending them, but ye have not hearkened; 
Then wi2l I make this house like Shiloh, and wi2l make this city a curse to a2l the nations of the earth. 
So the priests and the prophets and a2l the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD. 
Now it came to pa2s, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking a2l that the LORD had co2manded him to speak unto a2l the people, that the priests and the prophets and a2l the people t2ok him, saying, Thou shalt surely die. 
Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house sha2l be like Shiloh, and this city sha2l be desolate without an inhabitant? And a2l the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD. 
When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house. 
Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to a2l the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears. 
Then spake Jeremiah unto a2l the princes and to a2l the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city a2l the words that ye have heard. 
Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD wi2l repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you. 
As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as s2emeth g2od and m2et unto you. 
But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye sha2l surely bring i2nocent bl2od upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak a2l these words in your ears. 
Then said the princes and a2l the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God. 
Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to a2l the a2sembly of the people, saying, 
Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to a2l the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion sha2l be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem sha2l become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest. 
Did Hezekiah king of Judah and a2l Judah put him at a2l to death? did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls. 
And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land a2cording to a2l the words of Jeremiah. 
And when Jehoiakim the king, with a2l his mighty men, and a2l the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt; 
And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt. 
And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the co2mon people. 
Neverthele2s the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death. 
In the begi2ning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 
Thus saith the LORD to me; Make th2e bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck, 
And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the A2monites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the me2sengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah; 
And co2mand them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus sha2l ye say unto your masters; 
I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it s2emed m2et unto me. 
And now have I given a2l these lands into the hand of Nebuchadne2zar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him. 
And a2l nations sha2l serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings sha2l serve themselves of him. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that the nation and kingdom which wi2l not serve the same Nebuchadne2zar the king of Babylon, and that wi2l not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation wi2l I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand. 
Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye sha2l not serve the king of Babylon: 
For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish. 
But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those wi2l I let remain sti2l in their own land, saith the LORD; and they sha2l ti2l it, and dwe2l therein. 
I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah a2cording to a2l these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live. 
Why wi2l ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that wi2l not serve the king of Babylon? 
Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye sha2l not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you. 
For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you. 
Also I spake to the priests and to a2l this people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the ve2sels of the LORD's house sha2l now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you. 
Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city be laid waste? 
But if they be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make interce2sion to the LORD of hosts, that the ve2sels which are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon. 
For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pi2lars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the ve2sels that remain in this city. 
Which Nebuchadne2zar king of Babylon t2ok not, when he ca2ried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and a2l the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; 
Yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the ve2sels that remain in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem; 
They sha2l be ca2ried to Babylon, and there sha2l they be until the day that I visit them, saith the LORD; then wi2l I bring them up, and restore them to this place. 
And it came to pa2s the same year, in the begi2ning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests and of a2l the people, saying, 
Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. 
Within two fu2l years wi2l I bring again into this place a2l the ve2sels of the LORD's house, that Nebuchadne2zar king of Babylon t2ok away from this place, and ca2ried them to Babylon: 
And I wi2l bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with a2l the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the LORD: for I wi2l break the yoke of the king of Babylon. 
Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of a2l the people that st2od in the house of the LORD, 
Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the ve2sels of the LORD's house, and a2l that is ca2ried away captive, from Babylon into this place. 
Neverthele2s hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of a2l the people; 
The prophets that have b2en before me and before th2e of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. 
The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet sha2l come to pa2s, then sha2l the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him. 
Then Hananiah the prophet t2ok the yoke from o2f the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and brake it. 
And Hananiah spake in the presence of a2l the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so wi2l I break the yoke of Nebuchadne2zar king of Babylon from the neck of a2l nations within the space of two fu2l years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way. 
Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from o2f the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying, 
Go and te2l Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of w2od; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron. 
For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of a2l these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadne2zar king of Babylon; and they sha2l serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also. 
Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent th2e; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie. 
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I wi2l cast th2e from o2f the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebe2lion against the LORD. 
So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month. 
Now these are the words of the le2ter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were ca2ried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to a2l the people whom Nebuchadne2zar had ca2ried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon; 
(After that Jeconiah the king, and the qu2en, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;) 
By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadne2zar king of Babylon) saying, 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto a2l that are ca2ried away captives, whom I have caused to be ca2ried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon; 
Build ye houses, and dwe2l in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them; 
Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished. 
And s2ek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be ca2ried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof sha2l ye have peace. 
For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed. 
For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the LORD. 
For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be a2complished at Babylon I wi2l visit you, and perform my g2od word toward you, in causing you to return to this place. 
For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. 
Then sha2l ye ca2l upon me, and ye sha2l go and pray unto me, and I wi2l hearken unto you. 
And ye sha2l s2ek me, and find me, when ye sha2l search for me with a2l your heart. 
And I wi2l be found of you, saith the LORD: and I wi2l turn away your captivity, and I wi2l gather you from a2l the nations, and from a2l the places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I wi2l bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be ca2ried away captive. 
Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in Babylon; 
Know that thus saith the LORD of the king that si2teth upon the throne of David, and of a2l the people that dwe2leth in this city, and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity; 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I wi2l send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and wi2l make them like vile figs, that ca2not be eaten, they are so evil. 
And I wi2l persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and wi2l deliver them to be removed to a2l the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hi2sing, and a reproach, among a2l the nations whither I have driven them: 
Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD. 
Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, a2l ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon: 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of M2aseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I wi2l deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon; and he sha2l slay them before your eyes; 
And of them sha2l be taken up a curse by a2l the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make th2e like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire; 
Because they have co2mi2ted vi2lany in Israel, and have co2mi2ted adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not co2manded them; even I know, and am a witne2s, saith the LORD. 
Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying, 
Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent le2ters in thy name unto a2l the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of M2aseiah the priest, and to a2l the priests, saying, 
The LORD hath made th2e priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be o2ficers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks. 
Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you? 
For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwe2l in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them. 
And Zephaniah the priest read this le2ter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet. 
Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 
Send to a2l them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie: 
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I wi2l punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his s2ed: he sha2l not have a man to dwe2l among this people; neither sha2l he behold the g2od that I wi2l do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebe2lion against the LORD. 
The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 
Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write th2e a2l the words that I have spoken unto th2e in a b2ok. 
For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I wi2l bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I wi2l cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they sha2l po2se2s it. 
And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah. 
For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace. 
Ask ye now, and s2e whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I s2e every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and a2l faces are turned into palene2s? 
Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble, but he sha2l be saved out of it. 
For it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I wi2l break his yoke from o2f thy neck, and wi2l burst thy bonds, and strangers sha2l no more serve themselves of him: 
But they sha2l serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I wi2l raise up unto them. 
Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I wi2l save th2e from afar, and thy s2ed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob sha2l return, and sha2l be in rest, and be quiet, and none sha2l make him afraid. 
For I am with th2e, saith the LORD, to save th2e: though I make a fu2l end of a2l nations whither I have sca2tered th2e, yet I wi2l not make a fu2l end of th2e: but I wi2l co2rect th2e in measure, and wi2l not leave th2e altogether unpunished. 
For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous. 
There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines. 
A2l thy lovers have forgo2ten th2e; they s2ek th2e not; for I have wounded th2e with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased. 
Why criest thou for thine a2fliction? thy so2row is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto th2e. 
Therefore a2l they that devour th2e sha2l be devoured; and a2l thine adversaries, every one of them, sha2l go into captivity; and they that spoil th2e sha2l be a spoil, and a2l that prey upon th2e wi2l I give for a prey. 
For I wi2l restore health unto th2e, and I wi2l heal th2e of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they ca2led th2e an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man s2eketh after. 
Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I wi2l bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwe2lingplaces; and the city sha2l be builded upon her own heap, and the palace sha2l remain after the ma2ner thereof. 
And out of them sha2l proc2ed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make me2ry: and I wi2l multiply them, and they sha2l not be few; I wi2l also glorify them, and they sha2l not be sma2l. 
Their children also sha2l be as aforetime, and their congregation sha2l be established before me, and I wi2l punish a2l that o2pre2s them. 
And their nobles sha2l be of themselves, and their governor sha2l proc2ed from the midst of them; and I wi2l cause him to draw near, and he sha2l a2proach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to a2proach unto me? saith the LORD. 
And ye sha2l be my people, and I wi2l be your God. 
Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it sha2l fa2l with pain upon the head of the wicked. 
The fierce anger of the LORD sha2l not return, until he hath done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the la2ter days ye sha2l consider it. 
At the same time, saith the LORD, wi2l I be the God of a2l the families of Israel, and they sha2l be my people. 
Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderne2s; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest. 
The LORD hath a2peared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved th2e with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindne2s have I drawn th2e. 
Again I wi2l build th2e, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make me2ry. 
Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters sha2l plant, and sha2l eat them as co2mon things. 
For there sha2l be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim sha2l cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our God. 
For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladne2s for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel. 
Behold, I wi2l bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company sha2l return thither. 
They sha2l come with w2eping, and with su2plications wi2l I lead them: I wi2l cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they sha2l not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn. 
Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar o2f, and say, He that sca2tered Israel wi2l gather him, and k2ep him, as a shepherd doth his flock. 
For the LORD hath red2emed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he. 
Therefore they sha2l come and sing in the height of Zion, and sha2l flow together to the g2odne2s of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul sha2l be as a watered garden; and they sha2l not so2row any more at a2l. 
Then sha2l the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I wi2l turn their mourning into joy, and wi2l comfort them, and make them rejoice from their so2row. 
And I wi2l satiate the soul of the priests with fatne2s, and my people sha2l be satisfied with my g2odne2s, saith the LORD. 
Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bi2ter w2eping; Rahel w2eping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not. 
Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from w2eping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work sha2l be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they sha2l come again from the land of the enemy. 
And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy children sha2l come again to their own border. 
I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bu2lock una2customed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I sha2l be turned; for thou art the LORD my God. 
Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth. 
Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him sti2l: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I wi2l surely have mercy upon him, saith the LORD. 
Set th2e up waymarks, make th2e high heaps: set thine heart toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities. 
How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman sha2l compa2s a man. 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they sha2l use this sp2ech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I sha2l bring again their captivity; The LORD ble2s th2e, O habitation of justice, and mountain of holine2s. 
And there sha2l dwe2l in Judah itself, and in a2l the cities thereof together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks. 
For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every so2rowful soul. 
Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sl2ep was sw2et unto me. 
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I wi2l sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the s2ed of man, and with the s2ed of beast. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that like as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to a2flict; so wi2l I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the LORD. 
In those days they sha2l say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's t2eth are set on edge. 
But every one sha2l die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his t2eth sha2l be set on edge. 
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I wi2l make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: 
Not a2cording to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I t2ok them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD: 
But this sha2l be the covenant that I wi2l make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I wi2l put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and wi2l be their God, and they sha2l be my people. 
And they sha2l teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they sha2l a2l know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I wi2l forgive their iniquity, and I wi2l remember their sin no more. 
Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the m2on and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts is his name: 
If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, then the s2ed of Israel also sha2l cease from being a nation before me for ever. 
Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I wi2l also cast o2f a2l the s2ed of Israel for a2l that they have done, saith the LORD. 
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city sha2l be built to the LORD from the tower of Hanan2el unto the gate of the corner. 
And the measuring line sha2l yet go forth over against it upon the hi2l Gareb, and sha2l compa2s about to Goath. 
And the whole va2ley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and a2l the fields unto the br2ok of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, sha2l be holy unto the LORD; it sha2l not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever. 
The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eight2enth year of Nebuchadre2zar. 
For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah's house. 
For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I wi2l give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he sha2l take it; 
And Zedekiah king of Judah sha2l not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but sha2l surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and sha2l speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes sha2l behold his eyes; 
And he sha2l lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there sha2l he be until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye sha2l not prosper. 
And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Behold, Hanam2el the son of Sha2lum thine uncle sha2l come unto th2e saying, Buy th2e my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is thine to buy it. 
So Hanam2el mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison a2cording to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray th2e, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD. 
And I bought the field of Hanam2el my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even sevent2en shekels of silver. 
And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and t2ok witne2ses, and weighed him the money in the balances. 
So I t2ok the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed a2cording to the law and custom, and that which was open: 
And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of M2aseiah, in the sight of Hanam2el mine uncle's son, and in the presence of the witne2ses that subscribed the b2ok of the purchase, before a2l the Jews that sat in the court of the prison. 
And I charged Baruch before them, saying, 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen ve2sel, that they may continue many days. 
For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards sha2l be po2se2sed again in this land. 
Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying, 
Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing t2o hard for th2e: 
Thou shewest lovingkindne2s unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name, 
Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are open upon a2l the ways of the sons of men: to give every one a2cording to his ways, and a2cording to the fruit of his doings: 
Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast made th2e a name, as at this day; 
And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great te2ror; 
And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; 
And they came in, and po2se2sed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of a2l that thou co2mandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused a2l this evil to come upon them: 
Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pa2s; and, behold, thou s2est it. 
And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy th2e the field for money, and take witne2ses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans. 
Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 
Behold, I am the LORD, the God of a2l flesh: is there any thing t2o hard for me? 
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I wi2l give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon, and he sha2l take it: 
And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, sha2l come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose r2ofs they have o2fered incense unto B2al, and poured out drink o2ferings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger. 
For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the LORD. 
For this city hath b2en to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face, 
Because of a2l the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction. 
But they set their abominations in the house, which is ca2led by my name, to defile it. 
And they built the high places of B2al, which are in the va2ley of the son of Hi2nom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pa2s through the fire unto Molech; which I co2manded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin. 
And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It sha2l be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; 
Behold, I wi2l gather them out of a2l countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I wi2l bring them again unto this place, and I wi2l cause them to dwe2l safely: 
And they sha2l be my people, and I wi2l be their God: 
And I wi2l give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the g2od of them, and of their children after them: 
And I wi2l make an everlasting covenant with them, that I wi2l not turn away from them, to do them g2od; but I wi2l put my fear in their hearts, that they sha2l not depart from me. 
Yea, I wi2l rejoice over them to do them g2od, and I wi2l plant them in this land a2suredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul. 
For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought a2l this great evil upon this people, so wi2l I bring upon them a2l the g2od that I have promised them. 
And fields sha2l be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans. 
Men sha2l buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal them, and take witne2ses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the va2ley, and in the cities of the south: for I wi2l cause their captivity to return, saith the LORD. 
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying, 
Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD is his name; 
Ca2l unto me, and I wi2l answer th2e, and shew th2e great and mighty things, which thou knowest not. 
For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword; 
They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fi2l them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and for a2l whose wickedne2s I have hid my face from this city. 
Behold, I wi2l bring it health and cure, and I wi2l cure them, and wi2l reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth. 
And I wi2l cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and wi2l build them, as at the first. 
And I wi2l cleanse them from a2l their iniquity, whereby they have si2ned against me; and I wi2l pardon a2l their iniquities, whereby they have si2ned, and whereby they have transgre2sed against me. 
And it sha2l be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before a2l the nations of the earth, which sha2l hear a2l the g2od that I do unto them: and they sha2l fear and tremble for a2l the g2odne2s and for a2l the prosperity that I procure unto it. 
Thus saith the LORD; Again there sha2l be heard in this place, which ye say sha2l be desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the str2ets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast, 
The voice of joy, and the voice of gladne2s, the voice of the bridegr2om, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that sha2l say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is g2od; for his mercy endureth for ever: and of them that sha2l bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I wi2l cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD. 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in a2l the cities thereof, sha2l be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down. 
In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, sha2l the flocks pa2s again under the hands of him that te2leth them, saith the LORD. 
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I wi2l perform that g2od thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah. 
In those days, and at that time, wi2l I cause the Branch of righteousne2s to grow up unto David; and he sha2l execute judgment and righteousne2s in the land. 
In those days sha2l Judah be saved, and Jerusalem sha2l dwe2l safely: and this is the name wherewith she sha2l be ca2led, The LORD our righteousne2s. 
For thus saith the LORD; David sha2l never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel; 
Neither sha2l the priests the Levites want a man before me to o2fer burnt o2ferings, and to kindle meat o2ferings, and to do sacrifice continua2ly. 
And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying, 
Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season; 
Then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers. 
As the host of heaven ca2not be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so wi2l I multiply the s2ed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me. 
Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, 
Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them o2f? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them. 
Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night, and if I have not a2pointed the ordinances of heaven and earth; 
Then wi2l I cast away the s2ed of Jacob and David my servant, so that I wi2l not take any of his s2ed to be rulers over the s2ed of Abraham, Is2ac, and Jacob: for I wi2l cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them. 
The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadne2zar king of Babylon, and a2l his army, and a2l the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and a2l the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against a2l the cities thereof, saying, 
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and te2l him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I wi2l give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he sha2l burn it with fire: 
And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes sha2l behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he sha2l speak with th2e mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon. 
Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of th2e, Thou shalt not die by the sword: 
But thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before th2e, so sha2l they burn odours for th2e; and they wi2l lament th2e, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD. 
Then Jeremiah the prophet spake a2l these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem, 
When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against a2l the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah. 
This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with a2l the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them; 
That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewe2s, go fr2e; that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother. 
Now when a2l the princes, and a2l the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go fr2e, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go. 
But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go fr2e, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids. 
Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying, 
At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath b2en sold unto th2e; and when he hath served th2e six years, thou shalt let him go fr2e from th2e: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear. 
And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is ca2led by my name: 
But ye turned and po2luted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids. 
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I wi2l make you to be removed into a2l the kingdoms of the earth. 
And I wi2l give the men that have transgre2sed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and pa2sed betw2en the parts thereof, 
The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and a2l the people of the land, which pa2sed betw2en the parts of the calf; 
I wi2l even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that s2ek their life: and their dead bodies sha2l be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth. 
And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes wi2l I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that s2ek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you. 
Behold, I wi2l co2mand, saith the LORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they sha2l fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I wi2l make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant. 
The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, 
Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink. 
Then I t2ok J2azaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and a2l his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites; 
And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of M2aseiah the son of Sha2lum, the k2eper of the d2or: 
And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots fu2l of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine. 
But they said, We wi2l drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father co2manded us, saying, Ye sha2l drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever: 
Neither sha2l ye build house, nor sow s2ed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any: but a2l your days ye sha2l dwe2l in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangers. 
Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in a2l that he hath charged us, to drink no wine a2l our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters; 
Nor to build houses for us to dwe2l in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor s2ed: 
But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done a2cording to a2l that Jonadab our father co2manded us. 
But it came to pa2s, when Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwe2l at Jerusalem. 
Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and te2l the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Wi2l ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD. 
The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he co2manded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father's co2mandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me. 
I have sent also unto you a2l my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye sha2l dwe2l in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me. 
Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the co2mandment of their father, which he co2manded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto me: 
Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I wi2l bring upon Judah and upon a2l the inhabitants of Jerusalem a2l the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have ca2led unto them, but they have not answered. 
And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the co2mandment of Jonadab your father, and kept a2l his precepts, and done a2cording unto a2l that he hath co2manded you: 
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab sha2l not want a man to stand before me for ever. 
And it came to pa2s in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 
Take th2e a ro2l of a b2ok, and write therein a2l the words that I have spoken unto th2e against Israel, and against Judah, and against a2l the nations, from the day I spake unto th2e, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day. 
It may be that the house of Judah wi2l hear a2l the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin. 
Then Jeremiah ca2led Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah a2l the words of the LORD, which he had spoken unto him, upon a ro2l of a b2ok. 
And Jeremiah co2manded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I ca2not go into the house of the LORD: 
Therefore go thou, and read in the ro2l, which thou hast wri2ten from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD's house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of a2l Judah that come out of their cities. 
It may be they wi2l present their su2plication before the LORD, and wi2l return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people. 
And Baruch the son of Neriah did a2cording to a2l that Jeremiah the prophet co2manded him, reading in the b2ok the words of the LORD in the LORD's house. 
And it came to pa2s in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to a2l the people in Jerusalem, and to a2l the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem. 
Then read Baruch in the b2ok the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of a2l the people. 
When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the b2ok a2l the words of the LORD, 
Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and, lo, a2l the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and a2l the princes. 
Then Michaiah declared unto them a2l the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the b2ok in the ears of the people. 
Therefore a2l the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the ro2l wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah t2ok the ro2l in his hand, and came unto them. 
And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears. 
Now it came to pa2s, when they had heard a2l the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We wi2l surely te2l the king of a2l these words. 
And they asked Baruch, saying, Te2l us now, How didst thou write a2l these words at his mouth? 
Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced a2l these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the b2ok. 
Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide th2e, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be. 
And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the ro2l in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told a2l the words in the ears of the king. 
So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the ro2l: and he t2ok it out of Elishama the scribe's chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of a2l the princes which st2od beside the king. 
Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him. 
And it came to pa2s, that when Jehudi had read thr2e or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until a2l the ro2l was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth. 
Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard a2l these words. 
Neverthele2s Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made interce2sion to the king that he would not burn the ro2l: but he would not hear them. 
But the king co2manded Jerahm2el the son of Ha2melech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abd2el, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them. 
Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the ro2l, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying, 
Take th2e again another ro2l, and write in it a2l the former words that were in the first ro2l, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned. 
And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this ro2l, saying, Why hast thou wri2ten therein, saying, The king of Babylon sha2l certainly come and destroy this land, and sha2l cause to cease from thence man and beast? 
Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He sha2l have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body sha2l be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost. 
And I wi2l punish him and his s2ed and his servants for their iniquity; and I wi2l bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, a2l the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not. 
Then t2ok Jeremiah another ro2l, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah a2l the words of the b2ok which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were a2ded besides unto them many like words. 
And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah. 
But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah. 
And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of M2aseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us. 
Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison. 
Then Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem. 
Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah saying, 
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus sha2l ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, sha2l return to Egypt into their own land. 
And the Chaldeans sha2l come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire. 
Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans sha2l surely depart from us: for they sha2l not depart. 
For though ye had smi2ten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire. 
And it came to pa2s, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army, 
Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people. 
And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he t2ok Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fa2lest away to the Chaldeans. 
Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fa2l not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah t2ok Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes. 
Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison. 
When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days; 
Then Zedekiah the king sent, and t2ok him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon. 
Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I o2fended against th2e, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison? 
Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon sha2l not come against you, nor against this land? 
Therefore hear now, I pray th2e, O my lord the king: let my su2plication, I pray th2e, be a2cepted before th2e; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there. 
Then Zedekiah the king co2manded that they should co2mit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' str2et, until a2l the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison. 
Then Shephatiah the son of Ma2tan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto a2l the people, saying, 
Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city sha2l die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans sha2l live; for he sha2l have his life for a prey, and sha2l live. 
Thus saith the LORD, This city sha2l surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which sha2l take it. 
Therefore the princes said unto the king, We bes2ech th2e, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of a2l the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man s2eketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt. 
Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you. 
Then t2ok they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Ha2melech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire. 
Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then si2ting in the gate of Benjamin; 
Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king saying, 
My lord the king, these men have done evil in a2l that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the city. 
Then the king co2manded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with th2e, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die. 
So Ebedmelech t2ok the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and t2ok thence old cast clouts and old ro2ten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah. 
And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and ro2ten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so. 
So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and t2ok him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison. 
Then Zedekiah the king sent, and t2ok Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I wi2l ask th2e a thing; hide nothing from me. 
Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto th2e, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give th2e counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me? 
So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I wi2l not put th2e to death, neither wi2l I give th2e into the hand of these men that s2ek thy life. 
Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt a2suredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul sha2l live, and this city sha2l not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house: 
But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then sha2l this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they sha2l burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand. 
And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fa2len to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me. 
But Jeremiah said, They sha2l not deliver th2e. Obey, I bes2ech th2e, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto th2e: so it sha2l be we2l unto th2e, and thy soul sha2l live. 
But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath shewed me: 
And, behold, a2l the women that are left in the king of Judah's house sha2l be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women sha2l say, Thy friends have set th2e on, and have prevailed against th2e: thy f2et are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back. 
So they sha2l bring out a2l thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire. 
Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die. 
But if the princes hear that I have talked with th2e, and they come unto th2e, and say unto th2e, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we wi2l not put th2e to death; also what the king said unto th2e: 
Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my su2plication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there. 
Then came a2l the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them a2cording to a2l these words that the king had co2manded. So they left o2f speaking with him; for the ma2ter was not perceived. 
So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken. 
In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon and a2l his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it. 
And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up. 
And a2l the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the mi2dle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with a2l the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon. 
And it came to pa2s, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and a2l the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate betwixt the two wa2ls: and he went out the way of the plain. 
But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overt2ok Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadne2zar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him. 
Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew a2l the nobles of Judah. 
Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to ca2ry him to Babylon. 
And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the wa2ls of Jerusalem. 
Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard ca2ried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fe2l away, that fe2l to him, with the rest of the people that remained. 
But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the p2or of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time. 
Now Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying, 
Take him, and l2ok we2l to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he sha2l say unto th2e. 
So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and a2l the king of Babylon's princes; 
Even they sent, and t2ok Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and co2mi2ted him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should ca2ry him home: so he dwelt among the people. 
Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying, 
Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I wi2l bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for g2od; and they sha2l be a2complished in that day before th2e. 
But I wi2l deliver th2e in that day, saith the LORD: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid. 
For I wi2l surely deliver th2e, and thou shalt not fa2l by the sword, but thy life sha2l be for a prey unto th2e: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD. 
The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among a2l that were ca2ried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were ca2ried away captive unto Babylon. 
And the captain of the guard t2ok Jeremiah, and said unto him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 
Now the LORD hath brought it, and done a2cording as he hath said: because ye have si2ned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you. 
And now, behold, I l2ose th2e this day from the chains which were upon thine hand. If it s2em g2od unto th2e to come with me into Babylon, come; and I wi2l l2ok we2l unto th2e: but if it s2em i2l unto th2e to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, a2l the land is before th2e: whither it s2emeth g2od and convenient for th2e to go, thither go. 
Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwe2l with him among the people: or go wheresoever it s2emeth convenient unto th2e to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go. 
Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land. 
Now when a2l the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had co2mi2ted unto him men, and women, and children, and of the p2or of the land, of them that were not ca2ried away captive to Babylon; 
Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a M2achathite, they and their men. 
And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwe2l in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it sha2l be we2l with you. 
As for me, behold, I wi2l dwe2l at Mizpah, to serve the Chaldeans, which wi2l come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and su2mer fruits, and oil, and put them in your ve2sels, and dwe2l in your cities that ye have taken. 
Likewise when a2l the Jews that were in Moab, and among the A2monites, and in Edom, and that were in a2l the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan; 
Even a2l the Jews returned out of a2l places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and su2mer fruits very much. 
Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and a2l the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, 
And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that B2alis the king of the A2monites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay th2e? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not. 
Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly saying, Let me go, I pray th2e, and I wi2l slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man sha2l know it: wherefore should he slay th2e, that a2l the Jews which are gathered unto th2e should be sca2tered, and the remnant in Judah perish? 
But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael. 
Now it came to pa2s in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the s2ed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah. 
Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. 
Ishmael also slew a2l the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war. 
And it came to pa2s the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it, 
That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with o2ferings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD. 
And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to m2et them, w2eping a2l along as he went: and it came to pa2s, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. 
And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him. 
But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren. 
Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast a2l the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for fear of B2asha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah fi2led it with them that were slain. 
Then Ishmael ca2ried away captive a2l the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and a2l the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had co2mi2ted to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah ca2ried them away captive, and departed to go over to the A2monites. 
But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and a2l the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of a2l the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done, 
Then they t2ok a2l the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon. 
Now it came to pa2s, that when a2l the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and a2l the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad. 
So a2l the people that Ishmael had ca2ried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah. 
But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the A2monites. 
Then t2ok Johanan the son of Kareah, and a2l the captains of the forces that were with him, a2l the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon: 
And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt, 
Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land. 
Then a2l the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and a2l the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near, 
And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we bes2ech th2e, our su2plication be a2cepted before th2e, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, even for a2l this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:) 
That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do. 
Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I wi2l pray unto the LORD your God a2cording to your words; and it sha2l come to pa2s, that whatsoever thing the LORD sha2l answer you, I wi2l declare it unto you; I wi2l k2ep nothing back from you. 
Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witne2s betw2en us, if we do not even a2cording to a2l things for the which the LORD thy God sha2l send th2e to us. 
Whether it be g2od, or whether it be evil, we wi2l obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send th2e; that it may be we2l with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God. 
And it came to pa2s after ten days, that the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah. 
Then ca2led he Johanan the son of Kareah, and a2l the captains of the forces which were with him, and a2l the people from the least even to the greatest, 
And said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your su2plication before him; 
If ye wi2l sti2l abide in this land, then wi2l I build you, and not pu2l you down, and I wi2l plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you. 
Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand. 
And I wi2l shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land. 
But if ye say, We wi2l not dwe2l in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God, 
Saying, No; but we wi2l go into the land of Egypt, where we sha2l s2e no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there wi2l we dwe2l: 
And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye who2ly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there; 
Then it sha2l come to pa2s, that the sword, which ye feared, sha2l overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were afraid, sha2l fo2low close after you there in Egypt; and there ye sha2l die. 
So sha2l it be with a2l the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they sha2l die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them sha2l remain or escape from the evil that I wi2l bring upon them. 
For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and my fury hath b2en poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so sha2l my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye sha2l enter into Egypt: and ye sha2l be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye sha2l s2e this place no more. 
The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day. 
For ye di2sembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and a2cording unto a2l that the LORD our God sha2l say, so declare unto us, and we wi2l do it. 
And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you. 
Now therefore know certainly that ye sha2l die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn. 
And it came to pa2s, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto a2l the people a2l the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even a2l these words, 
Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and a2l the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent th2e to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there: 
But Baruch the son of Neriah se2teth th2e on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and ca2ry us away captives into Babylon. 
So Johanan the son of Kareah, and a2l the captains of the forces, and a2l the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwe2l in the land of Judah. 
But Johanan the son of Kareah, and a2l the captains of the forces, t2ok a2l the remnant of Judah, that were returned from a2l nations, whither they had b2en driven, to dwe2l in the land of Judah; 
Even men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah. 
So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes. 
Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, 
Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the bric2kiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah; 
And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I wi2l send and take Nebuchadre2zar the king of Babylon, my servant, and wi2l set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he sha2l spread his royal pavilion over them. 
And when he cometh, he sha2l smite the land of Egypt, and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword. 
And I wi2l kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he sha2l burn them, and ca2ry them away captives: and he sha2l a2ray himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd pu2teth on his garment; and he sha2l go forth from thence in peace. 
He sha2l break also the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians sha2l he burn with fire. 
The word that came to Jeremiah concerning a2l the Jews which dwe2l in the land of Egypt, which dwe2l at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying, 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have s2en a2l the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon a2l the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwe2leth therein, 
Because of their wickedne2s which they have co2mi2ted to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers. 
Howbeit I sent unto you a2l my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate. 
But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedne2s, to burn no incense unto other gods. 
Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the str2ets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day. 
Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore co2mit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut o2f from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain; 
In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwe2l, that ye might cut yourselves o2f, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among a2l the nations of the earth? 
Have ye forgo2ten the wickedne2s of your fathers, and the wickedne2s of the kings of Judah, and the wickedne2s of their wives, and your own wickedne2s, and the wickedne2s of your wives, which they have co2mi2ted in the land of Judah, and in the str2ets of Jerusalem? 
They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers. 
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I wi2l set my face against you for evil, and to cut o2f a2l Judah. 
And I wi2l take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they sha2l a2l be consumed, and fa2l in the land of Egypt; they sha2l even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they sha2l die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they sha2l be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach. 
For I wi2l punish them that dwe2l in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: 
So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, sha2l escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwe2l there: for none sha2l return but such as sha2l escape. 
Then a2l the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and a2l the women that st2od by, a great multitude, even a2l the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, 
As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we wi2l not hearken unto th2e. 
But we wi2l certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the qu2en of heaven, and to pour out drink o2ferings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the str2ets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were we2l, and saw no evil. 
But since we left o2f to burn incense to the qu2en of heaven, and to pour out drink o2ferings unto her, we have wanted a2l things, and have b2en consumed by the sword and by the famine. 
And when we burned incense to the qu2en of heaven, and poured out drink o2ferings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink o2ferings unto her, without our men? 
Then Jeremiah said unto a2l the people, to the men, and to the women, and to a2l the people which had given him that answer, saying, 
The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the str2ets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind? 
So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have co2mi2ted; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day. 
Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have si2ned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is ha2pened unto you, as at this day. 
Moreover Jeremiah said unto a2l the people, and to a2l the women, Hear the word of the LORD, a2l Judah that are in the land of Egypt: 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfi2led with your hand, saying, We wi2l surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the qu2en of heaven, and to pour out drink o2ferings unto her: ye wi2l surely a2complish your vows, and surely perform your vows. 
Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, a2l Judah that dwe2l in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name sha2l no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in a2l the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth. 
Behold, I wi2l watch over them for evil, and not for g2od: and a2l the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt sha2l be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them. 
Yet a sma2l number that escape the sword sha2l return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and a2l the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, sha2l know whose words sha2l stand, mine, or their's. 
And this sha2l be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I wi2l punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words sha2l surely stand against you for evil: 
Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I wi2l give Pharao2hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that s2ek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life. 
The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had wri2ten these words in a b2ok at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, 
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto th2e, O Baruch: 
Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath a2ded grief to my so2row; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest. 
Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, that which I have built wi2l I break down, and that which I have planted I wi2l pluck up, even this whole land. 
And s2ekest thou great things for thyself? s2ek them not: for, behold, I wi2l bring evil upon a2l flesh, saith the LORD: but thy life wi2l I give unto th2e for a prey in a2l places whither thou goest. 
The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles; 
Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah. 
Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to ba2tle. 
Harne2s the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines. 
Wherefore have I s2en them dismayed and turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and l2ok not back: for fear was round about, saith the LORD. 
Let not the swift fl2e away, nor the mighty man escape; they sha2l stumble, and fa2l toward the north by the river Euphrates. 
Who is this that cometh up as a fl2od, whose waters are moved as the rivers? 
Egypt riseth up like a fl2od, and his waters are moved like the rivers; and he saith, I wi2l go up, and wi2l cover the earth; I wi2l destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof. 
Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow. 
For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword sha2l devour, and it sha2l be satiate and made drunk with their bl2od: for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates. 
Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; for thou shalt not be cured. 
The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath fi2led the land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, and they are fa2len both together. 
The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt. 
Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare th2e; for the sword sha2l devour round about th2e. 
Why are thy valiant men swept away? they st2od not, because the LORD did drive them. 
He made many to fa2l, yea, one fe2l upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the o2pre2sing sword. 
They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath pa2sed the time a2pointed. 
As I live, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so sha2l he come. 
O thou daughter dwe2ling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity: for Noph sha2l be waste and desolate without an inhabitant. 
Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction cometh; it cometh out of the north. 
Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fa2ted bu2locks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away together: they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come upon them, and the time of their visitation. 
The voice thereof sha2l go like a serpent; for they sha2l march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of w2od. 
They sha2l cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though it ca2not be searched; because they are more than the gra2sho2pers, and are i2numerable. 
The daughter of Egypt sha2l be confounded; she sha2l be delivered into the hand of the people of the north. 
The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I wi2l punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and a2l them that trust in him: 
And I wi2l deliver them into the hand of those that s2ek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it sha2l be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the LORD. 
But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel: for, behold, I wi2l save th2e from afar o2f, and thy s2ed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob sha2l return, and be in rest and at ease, and none sha2l make him afraid. 
Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD: for I am with th2e; for I wi2l make a fu2l end of a2l the nations whither I have driven th2e: but I wi2l not make a fu2l end of th2e, but co2rect th2e in measure; yet wi2l I not leave th2e who2ly unpunished. 
The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza. 
Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and sha2l be an overflowing fl2od, and sha2l overflow the land, and a2l that is therein; the city, and them that dwe2l therein: then the men sha2l cry, and a2l the inhabitants of the land sha2l howl. 
At the noise of the stamping of the h2ofs of his strong horses, at the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of his wh2els, the fathers sha2l not l2ok back to their children for f2eblene2s of hands; 
Because of the day that cometh to spoil a2l the Philistines, and to cut o2f from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the LORD wi2l spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor. 
Baldne2s is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut o2f with the remnant of their va2ley: how long wilt thou cut thyself? 
O thou sword of the LORD, how long wi2l it be ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into thy sca2bard, rest, and be sti2l. 
How can it be quiet, s2eing the LORD hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he a2pointed it. 
Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded and taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed. 
There sha2l be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it o2f from being a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword sha2l pursue th2e. 
A voice of crying sha2l be from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction. 
Moab is destroyed; her li2tle ones have caused a cry to be heard. 
For in the going up of Luhith continual w2eping sha2l go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction. 
Fl2e, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderne2s. 
For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh sha2l go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together. 
And the spoiler sha2l come upon every city, and no city sha2l escape: the va2ley also sha2l perish, and the plain sha2l be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken. 
Give wings unto Moab, that it may fl2e and get away: for the cities thereof sha2l be desolate, without any to dwe2l therein. 
Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfu2ly, and cursed be he that k2epeth back his sword from bl2od. 
Moab hath b2en at ease from his youth, and he hath se2tled on his l2es, and hath not b2en emptied from ve2sel to ve2sel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed. 
Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I wi2l send unto him wanderers, that sha2l cause him to wander, and sha2l empty his ve2sels, and break their bo2tles. 
And Moab sha2l be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence. 
How say ye, We are mighty and strong men for the war? 
Moab is spoiled, and gone up out of her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts. 
The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his a2fliction hasteth fast. 
A2l ye that are about him, bemoan him; and a2l ye that know his name, say, How is the strong sta2f broken, and the beautiful rod! 
Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab sha2l come upon th2e, and he sha2l destroy thy strong holds. 
O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fl2eth, and her that escapeth, and say, What is done? 
Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; te2l ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled, 
And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Meph2ath, 
And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim, 
And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon, 
And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon a2l the cities of the land of Moab, far or near. 
The horn of Moab is cut o2f, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD. 
Make ye him drunken: for he magnified himself against the LORD: Moab also sha2l wa2low in his vomit, and he also sha2l be in derision. 
For was not Israel a derision unto th2e? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou ski2pedst for joy. 
O ye that dwe2l in Moab, leave the cities, and dwe2l in the rock, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth. 
We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exc2eding proud) his loftine2s, and his a2rogancy, and his pride, and the haughtine2s of his heart. 
I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but it sha2l not be so; his lies sha2l not so e2fect it. 
Therefore wi2l I howl for Moab, and I wi2l cry out for a2l Moab; mine heart sha2l mourn for the men of Kirheres. 
O vine of Sibmah, I wi2l w2ep for th2e with the w2eping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fa2len upon thy su2mer fruits and upon thy vintage. 
And joy and gladne2s is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab, and I have caused wine to fail from the winepre2ses: none sha2l tread with shouting; their shouting sha2l be no shouting. 
From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz, have they u2tered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, as an heifer of thr2e years old: for the waters also of Nimrim sha2l be desolate. 
Moreover I wi2l cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that o2fereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods. 
Therefore mine heart sha2l sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart sha2l sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches that he hath go2ten are perished. 
For every head sha2l be bald, and every beard cli2ped: upon a2l the hands sha2l be cu2tings, and upon the loins sackcloth. 
There sha2l be lamentation genera2ly upon a2l the housetops of Moab, and in the str2ets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a ve2sel wherein is no pleasure, saith the LORD. 
They sha2l howl, saying, How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so sha2l Moab be a derision and a dismaying to a2l them about him. 
For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he sha2l fly as an eagle, and sha2l spread his wings over Moab. 
Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day sha2l be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. 
And Moab sha2l be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against the LORD. 
Fear, and the pit, and the snare, sha2l be upon th2e, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD. 
He that fl2eth from the fear sha2l fa2l into the pit; and he that ge2teth up out of the pit sha2l be taken in the snare: for I wi2l bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD. 
They that fled st2od under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire sha2l come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and sha2l devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones. 
Woe be unto th2e, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives. 
Yet wi2l I bring again the captivity of Moab in the la2ter days, saith the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab. 
Concerning the A2monites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why then doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwe2l in his cities? 
Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I wi2l cause an alarm of war to be heard in Ra2bah of the A2monites; and it sha2l be a desolate heap, and her daughters sha2l be burned with fire: then sha2l Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD. 
Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Ra2bah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king sha2l go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together. 
Wherefore gloriest thou in the va2leys, thy flowing va2ley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who sha2l come unto me? 
Behold, I wi2l bring a fear upon th2e, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from a2l those that be about th2e; and ye sha2l be driven out every man right forth; and none sha2l gather up him that wandereth. 
And afterward I wi2l bring again the captivity of the children of A2mon, saith the LORD. 
Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished? 
Fl2e ye, turn back, dwe2l d2ep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I wi2l bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I wi2l visit him. 
If grapegatherers come to th2e, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they wi2l destroy ti2l they have enough. 
But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he sha2l not be able to hide himself: his s2ed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not. 
Leave thy fatherle2s children, I wi2l preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me. 
For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have a2suredly drunken; and art thou he that sha2l altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it. 
For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah sha2l become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and a2l the cities thereof sha2l be perpetual wastes. 
I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an amba2sador is sent unto the heathen, saying, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the ba2tle. 
For, lo, I wi2l make th2e sma2l among the heathen, and despised among men. 
Thy te2riblene2s hath deceived th2e, and the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwe2lest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hi2l: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I wi2l bring th2e down from thence, saith the LORD. 
Also Edom sha2l be a desolation: every one that goeth by it sha2l be astonished, and sha2l hi2s at a2l the plagues thereof. 
As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomo2rah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD, no man sha2l abide there, neither sha2l a son of man dwe2l in it. 
Behold, he sha2l come up like a lion from the swe2ling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I wi2l su2denly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may a2point over her? for who is like me? and who wi2l a2point me the time? and who is that shepherd that wi2l stand before me? 
Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock sha2l draw them out: surely he sha2l make their habitations desolate with them. 
The earth is moved at the noise of their fa2l, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea. 
Behold, he sha2l come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day sha2l the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs. 
Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is so2row on the sea; it ca2not be quiet. 
Damascus is waxed f2eble, and turneth herself to fl2e, and fear hath seized on her: anguish and so2rows have taken her, as a woman in travail. 
How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy! 
Therefore her young men sha2l fa2l in her str2ets, and a2l the men of war sha2l be cut o2f in that day, saith the LORD of hosts. 
And I wi2l kindle a fire in the wa2l of Damascus, and it sha2l consume the palaces of Benhadad. 
Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon sha2l smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east. 
Their tents and their flocks sha2l they take away: they sha2l take to themselves their curtains, and a2l their ve2sels, and their camels; and they sha2l cry unto them, Fear is on every side. 
Fl2e, get you far o2f, dwe2l d2ep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you. 
Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwe2leth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, which dwe2l alone. 
And their camels sha2l be a b2oty, and the multitude of their ca2tle a spoil: and I wi2l sca2ter into a2l winds them that are in the utmost corners; and I wi2l bring their calamity from a2l sides thereof, saith the LORD. 
And Hazor sha2l be a dwe2ling for dragons, and a desolation for ever: there sha2l no man abide there, nor any son of man dwe2l in it. 
The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the begi2ning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying, 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I wi2l break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might. 
And upon Elam wi2l I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and wi2l sca2ter them toward a2l those winds; and there sha2l be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam sha2l not come. 
For I wi2l cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that s2ek their life: and I wi2l bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I wi2l send the sword after them, ti2l I have consumed them: 
And I wi2l set my throne in Elam, and wi2l destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD. 
But it sha2l come to pa2s in the la2ter days, that I wi2l bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD. 
The word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet. 
Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces. 
For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which sha2l make her land desolate, and none sha2l dwe2l therein: they sha2l remove, they sha2l depart, both man and beast. 
In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel sha2l come, they and the children of Judah together, going and w2eping: they sha2l go, and s2ek the LORD their God. 
They sha2l ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant that sha2l not be forgo2ten. 
My people hath b2en lost sh2ep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hi2l, they have forgo2ten their restingplace. 
A2l that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We o2fend not, because they have si2ned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers. 
Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks. 
For, lo, I wi2l raise and cause to come up against Babylon an a2sembly of great nations from the north country: and they sha2l set themselves in a2ray against her; from thence she sha2l be taken: their a2rows sha2l be as of a mighty expert man; none sha2l return in vain. 
And Chaldea sha2l be a spoil: a2l that spoil her sha2l be satisfied, saith the LORD. 
Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at gra2s, and be2low as bu2ls; 
Your mother sha2l be sore confounded; she that bare you sha2l be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations sha2l be a wilderne2s, a dry land, and a desert. 
Because of the wrath of the LORD it sha2l not be inhabited, but it sha2l be who2ly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon sha2l be astonished, and hi2s at a2l her plagues. 
Put yourselves in a2ray against Babylon round about: a2l ye that bend the bow, sh2ot at her, spare no a2rows: for she hath si2ned against the LORD. 
Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fa2len, her wa2ls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her. 
Cut o2f the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the o2pre2sing sword they sha2l turn every one to his people, and they sha2l fl2e every one to his own land. 
Israel is a sca2tered sh2ep; the lions have driven him away: first the king of A2syria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon hath broken his bones. 
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I wi2l punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of A2syria. 
And I wi2l bring Israel again to his habitation, and he sha2l f2ed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul sha2l be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead. 
In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel sha2l be sought for, and there sha2l be none; and the sins of Judah, and they sha2l not be found: for I wi2l pardon them whom I reserve. 
Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and u2terly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do a2cording to a2l that I have co2manded th2e. 
A sound of ba2tle is in the land, and of great destruction. 
How is the ha2mer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations! 
I have laid a snare for th2e, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD. 
The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans. 
Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her u2terly: let nothing of her be left. 
Slay a2l her bu2locks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation. 
The voice of them that fl2e and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple. 
Ca2l together the archers against Babylon: a2l ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her a2cording to her work; a2cording to a2l that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath b2en proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel. 
Therefore sha2l her young men fa2l in the str2ets, and a2l her men of war sha2l be cut o2f in that day, saith the LORD. 
Behold, I am against th2e, O thou most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I wi2l visit th2e. 
And the most proud sha2l stumble and fa2l, and none sha2l raise him up: and I wi2l kindle a fire in his cities, and it sha2l devour a2l round about him. 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah were o2pre2sed together: and a2l that t2ok them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go. 
Their Red2emer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he sha2l throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon. 
A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men. 
A sword is upon the liars; and they sha2l dote: a sword is upon her mighty men; and they sha2l be dismayed. 
A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon a2l the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they sha2l become as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they sha2l be ro2bed. 
A drought is upon her waters; and they sha2l be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols. 
Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands sha2l dwe2l there, and the owls sha2l dwe2l therein: and it sha2l be no more inhabited for ever; neither sha2l it be dwelt in from generation to generation. 
As God overthrew Sodom and Gomo2rah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD; so sha2l no man abide there, neither sha2l any son of man dwe2l therein. 
Behold, a people sha2l come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings sha2l be raised up from the coasts of the earth. 
They sha2l hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and wi2l not shew mercy: their voice sha2l roar like the sea, and they sha2l ride upon horses, every one put in a2ray, like a man to the ba2tle, against th2e, O daughter of Babylon. 
The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed f2eble: anguish t2ok hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail. 
Behold, he sha2l come up like a lion from the swe2ling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I wi2l make them su2denly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may a2point over her? for who is like me? and who wi2l a2point me the time? and who is that shepherd that wi2l stand before me? 
Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock sha2l draw them out: surely he sha2l make their habitation desolate with them. 
At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations. 
Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I wi2l raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwe2l in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind; 
And wi2l send unto Babylon fa2ners, that sha2l fan her, and sha2l empty her land: for in the day of trouble they sha2l be against her round about. 
Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye u2terly a2l her host. 
Thus the slain sha2l fa2l in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her str2ets. 
For Israel hath not b2en forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the LORD of hosts; though their land was fi2led with sin against the Holy One of Israel. 
Fl2e out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut o2f in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD's vengeance; he wi2l render unto her a recompence. 
Babylon hath b2en a golden cup in the LORD's hand, that made a2l the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad. 
Babylon is su2denly fa2len and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed. 
We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies. 
The LORD hath brought forth our righteousne2s: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God. 
Make bright the a2rows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple. 
Set up the standard upon the wa2ls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon. 
O thou that dwe2lest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousne2s. 
The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I wi2l fi2l th2e with men, as with caterpi2lers; and they sha2l lift up a shout against th2e. 
He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding. 
When he u2tereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures. 
Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falseh2od, and there is no breath in them. 
They are vanity, the work of e2rors: in the time of their visitation they sha2l perish. 
The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the former of a2l things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts is his name. 
Thou art my ba2tle axe and weapons of war: for with th2e wi2l I break in pieces the nations, and with th2e wi2l I destroy kingdoms; 
And with th2e wi2l I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with th2e wi2l I break in pieces the chariot and his rider; 
With th2e also wi2l I break in pieces man and woman; and with th2e wi2l I break in pieces old and young; and with th2e wi2l I break in pieces the young man and the maid; 
I wi2l also break in pieces with th2e the shepherd and his flock; and with th2e wi2l I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with th2e wi2l I break in pieces captains and rulers. 
And I wi2l render unto Babylon and to a2l the inhabitants of Chaldea a2l their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the LORD. 
Behold, I am against th2e, O destroying mountain, saith the LORD, which destroyest a2l the earth: and I wi2l stretch out mine hand upon th2e, and ro2l th2e down from the rocks, and wi2l make th2e a burnt mountain. 
And they sha2l not take of th2e a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the LORD. 
Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, ca2l together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Mi2ni, and Ashchenaz; a2point a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpi2lers. 
Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and a2l the rulers thereof, and a2l the land of his dominion. 
And the land sha2l tremble and so2row: for every purpose of the LORD sha2l be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant. 
The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwe2lingplaces; her bars are broken. 
One post sha2l run to m2et another, and one me2senger to m2et another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end, 
And that the pa2sages are sto2ped, and the r2eds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are a2frighted. 
For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfl2or, it is time to thresh her: yet a li2tle while, and the time of her harvest sha2l come. 
Nebuchadre2zar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty ve2sel, he hath swa2lowed me up like a dragon, he hath fi2led his be2ly with my delicates, he hath cast me out. 
The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, sha2l the inhabitant of Zion say; and my bl2od upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, sha2l Jerusalem say. 
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I wi2l plead thy cause, and take vengeance for th2e; and I wi2l dry up her sea, and make her springs dry. 
And Babylon sha2l become heaps, a dwe2lingplace for dragons, an astonishment, and an hi2sing, without an inhabitant. 
They sha2l roar together like lions: they sha2l ye2l as lions' whelps. 
In their heat I wi2l make their feasts, and I wi2l make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sl2ep a perpetual sl2ep, and not wake, saith the LORD. 
I wi2l bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats. 
How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations! 
The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof. 
Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderne2s, a land wherein no man dwe2leth, neither doth any son of man pa2s thereby. 
And I wi2l punish Bel in Babylon, and I wi2l bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swa2lowed up: and the nations sha2l not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wa2l of Babylon sha2l fa2l. 
My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD. 
And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that sha2l be heard in the land; a rumour sha2l both come one year, and after that in another year sha2l come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler. 
Therefore, behold, the days come, that I wi2l do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land sha2l be confounded, and a2l her slain sha2l fa2l in the midst of her. 
Then the heaven and the earth, and a2l that is therein, sha2l sing for Babylon: for the spoilers sha2l come unto her from the north, saith the LORD. 
As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fa2l, so at Babylon sha2l fa2l the slain of a2l the earth. 
Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not sti2l: remember the LORD afar o2f, and let Jerusalem come into your mind. 
We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD's house. 
Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I wi2l do judgment upon her graven images: and through a2l her land the wounded sha2l groan. 
Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me sha2l spoilers come unto her, saith the LORD. 
A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans: 
Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is u2tered: 
Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompences sha2l surely requite. 
And I wi2l make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they sha2l sl2ep a perpetual sl2ep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts. 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad wa2ls of Babylon sha2l be u2terly broken, and her high gates sha2l be burned with fire; and the people sha2l labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they sha2l be weary. 
The word which Jeremiah the prophet co2manded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of M2aseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince. 
So Jeremiah wrote in a b2ok a2l the evil that should come upon Babylon, even a2l these words that are wri2ten against Babylon. 
And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt s2e, and shalt read a2l these words; 
Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it o2f, that none sha2l remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it sha2l be desolate for ever. 
And it sha2l be, when thou hast made an end of reading this b2ok, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates: 
And thou shalt say, Thus sha2l Babylon sink, and sha2l not rise from the evil that I wi2l bring upon her: and they sha2l be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah. 
Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, a2cording to a2l that Jehoiakim had done. 
For through the anger of the LORD it came to pa2s in Jerusalem and Judah, ti2l he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebe2led against the king of Babylon. 
And it came to pa2s in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon came, he and a2l his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about. 
So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. 
And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land. 
Then the city was broken up, and a2l the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate betw2en the two wa2ls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain. 
But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overt2ok Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and a2l his army was sca2tered from him. 
Then they t2ok the king, and ca2ried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him. 
And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also a2l the princes of Judah in Riblah. 
Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and ca2ried him to Babylon, and put him in prison ti2l the day of his death. 
Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the ninet2enth year of Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem, 
And burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house; and a2l the houses of Jerusalem, and a2l the houses of the great men, burned he with fire: 
And a2l the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down a2l the wa2ls of Jerusalem round about. 
Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard ca2ried away captive certain of the p2or of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fe2l away, that fe2l to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude. 
But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the p2or of the land for vinedre2sers and for husbandmen. 
Also the pi2lars of bra2s that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans brake, and ca2ried a2l the bra2s of them to Babylon. 
The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snu2fers, and the bowls, and the sp2ons, and a2l the ve2sels of bra2s wherewith they ministered, t2ok they away. 
And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the sp2ons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, t2ok the captain of the guard away. 
The two pi2lars, one sea, and twelve brasen bu2ls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the bra2s of a2l these ve2sels was without weight. 
And concerning the pi2lars, the height of one pi2lar was eight2en cubits; and a fi2let of twelve cubits did compa2s it; and the thickne2s thereof was four fingers: it was ho2low. 
And a chapiter of bra2s was upon it; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, a2l of bra2s. The second pi2lar also and the pomegranates were like unto these. 
And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and a2l the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about. 
And the captain of the guard t2ok Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the thr2e k2epers of the d2or: 
He t2ok also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and thr2escore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city. 
So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard t2ok them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah. 
And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was ca2ried away captive out of his own land. 
This is the people whom Nebuchadre2zar ca2ried away captive: in the seventh year thr2e thousand Jews and thr2e and twenty: 
In the eight2enth year of Nebuchadre2zar he ca2ried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons: 
In the thr2e and twentieth year of Nebuchadre2zar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard ca2ried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: a2l the persons were four thousand and six hundred. 
And it came to pa2s in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison. 
And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon, 
And changed his prison garments: and he did continua2ly eat bread before him a2l the days of his life. 
And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, a2l the days of his life. 
How doth the city sit solitary, that was fu2l of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and prince2s among the provinces, how is she become tributary! 
She w2epeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her ch2eks: among a2l her lovers she hath none to comfort her: a2l her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies. 
Judah is gone into captivity because of a2fliction, and because of great servitude: she dwe2leth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: a2l her persecutors overt2ok her betw2en the straits. 
The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: a2l her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are a2flicted, and she is in bi2terne2s. 
Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath a2flicted her for the multitude of her transgre2sions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy. 
And from the daughter of Zion a2l her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer. 
Jerusalem remembered in the days of her a2fliction and of her miseries a2l her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fe2l into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sa2baths. 
Jerusalem hath grievously si2ned; therefore she is removed: a2l that honoured her despise her, because they have s2en her nakedne2s: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward. 
Her filthine2s is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfu2ly: she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my a2fliction: for the enemy hath magnified himself. 
The adversary hath spread out his hand upon a2l her pleasant things: for she hath s2en that the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst co2mand that they should not enter into thy congregation. 
A2l her people sigh, they s2ek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: s2e, O LORD, and consider; for I am become vile. 
Is it nothing to you, a2l ye that pa2s by? behold, and s2e if there be any so2row like unto my so2row, which is done unto me, wherewith the LORD hath a2flicted me in the day of his fierce anger. 
From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my f2et, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate and faint a2l the day. 
The yoke of my transgre2sions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fa2l, the LORD hath delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise up. 
The LORD hath tro2den under f2ot a2l my mighty men in the midst of me: he hath ca2led an a2sembly against me to crush my young men: the LORD hath tro2den the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepre2s. 
For these things I w2ep; mine eye, mine eye ru2neth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed. 
Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her: the LORD hath co2manded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should be round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them. 
The LORD is righteous; for I have rebe2led against his co2mandment: hear, I pray you, a2l people, and behold my so2row: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity. 
I ca2led for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls. 
Behold, O LORD; for I am in distre2s: my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebe2led: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death. 
They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: a2l mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast ca2led, and they sha2l be like unto me. 
Let a2l their wickedne2s come before th2e; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for a2l my transgre2sions: for my sighs are many, and my heart is faint. 
How hath the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his f2otst2ol in the day of his anger! 
The LORD hath swa2lowed up a2l the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to the ground: he hath po2luted the kingdom and the princes thereof. 
He hath cut o2f in his fierce anger a2l the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about. 
He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he st2od with his right hand as an adversary, and slew a2l that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire. 
The LORD was as an enemy: he hath swa2lowed up Israel, he hath swa2lowed up a2l her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation. 
And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the a2sembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sa2baths to be forgo2ten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest. 
The LORD hath cast o2f his altar, he hath abho2red his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the wa2ls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast. 
The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wa2l of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wa2l to lament; they languished together. 
Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD. 
The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and k2ep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground. 
Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings sw2on in the str2ets of the city. 
They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they sw2oned as the wounded in the str2ets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom. 
What thing sha2l I take to witne2s for th2e? what thing sha2l I liken to th2e, O daughter of Jerusalem? what sha2l I equal to th2e, that I may comfort th2e, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal th2e? 
Thy prophets have s2en vain and f2olish things for th2e: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have s2en for th2e false burdens and causes of banishment. 
A2l that pa2s by clap their hands at th2e; they hi2s and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men ca2l The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth? 
A2l thine enemies have opened their mouth against th2e: they hi2s and gnash the t2eth: they say, We have swa2lowed her up: certainly this is the day that we l2oked for; we have found, we have s2en it. 
The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath fulfi2led his word that he had co2manded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over th2e, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries. 
Their heart cried unto the LORD, O wa2l of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the a2ple of thine eye cease. 
Arise, cry out in the night: in the begi2ning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the LORD: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every str2et. 
Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Sha2l the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? sha2l the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord? 
The young and the old lie on the ground in the str2ets: my virgins and my young men are fa2len by the sword; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast ki2led, and not pitied. 
Thou hast ca2led as in a solemn day my te2rors round about, so that in the day of the LORD's anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swa2dled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed. 
I AM the man that hath s2en a2fliction by the rod of his wrath. 
He hath led me, and brought me into darkne2s, but not into light. 
Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me a2l the day. 
My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones. 
He hath builded against me, and compa2sed me with ga2l and travail. 
He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old. 
He hath hedged me about, that I ca2not get out: he hath made my chain heavy. 
Also when I cry and shout, he shu2teth out my prayer. 
He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths cr2oked. 
He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places. 
He hath turned aside my ways, and pu2led me in pieces: he hath made me desolate. 
He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the a2row. 
He hath caused the a2rows of his quiver to enter into my reins. 
I was a derision to a2l my people; and their song a2l the day. 
He hath fi2led me with bi2terne2s, he hath made me drunken with wormw2od. 
He hath also broken my t2eth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes. 
And thou hast removed my soul far o2f from peace: I forgat prosperity. 
And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD: 
Remembering mine a2fliction and my misery, the wormw2od and the ga2l. 
My soul hath them sti2l in remembrance, and is humbled in me. 
This I reca2l to my mind, therefore have I hope. 
It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compa2sions fail not. 
They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulne2s. 
The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore wi2l I hope in him. 
The LORD is g2od unto them that wait for him, to the soul that s2eketh him. 
It is g2od that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD. 
It is g2od for a man that he bear the yoke of his youth. 
He si2teth alone and k2epeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him. 
He pu2teth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope. 
He giveth his ch2ek to him that smiteth him: he is fi2led fu2l with reproach. 
For the LORD wi2l not cast o2f for ever: 
But though he cause grief, yet wi2l he have compa2sion a2cording to the multitude of his mercies. 
For he doth not a2flict wi2lingly nor grieve the children of men. 
To crush under his f2et a2l the prisoners of the earth. 
To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High, 
To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD a2proveth not. 
Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pa2s, when the Lord co2mandeth it not? 
Out of the mouth of the most High proc2edeth not evil and g2od? 
Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? 
Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD. 
Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens. 
We have transgre2sed and have rebe2led: thou hast not pardoned. 
Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied. 
Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pa2s through. 
Thou hast made us as the o2fscouring and refuse in the midst of the people. 
A2l our enemies have opened their mouths against us. 
Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction. 
Mine eye ru2neth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermi2sion. 
Ti2l the LORD l2ok down, and behold from heaven. 
Mine eye a2fecteth mine heart because of a2l the daughters of my city. 
Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause. 
They have cut o2f my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me. 
Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut o2f. 
I ca2led upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon. 
Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry. 
Thou drewest near in the day that I ca2led upon th2e: thou saidst, Fear not. 
O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast red2emed my life. 
O LORD, thou hast s2en my wrong: judge thou my cause. 
Thou hast s2en a2l their vengeance and a2l their imaginations against me. 
Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and a2l their imaginations against me; 
The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me a2l the day. 
Behold their si2ting down, and their rising up; I am their musick. 
Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, a2cording to the work of their hands. 
Give them so2row of heart, thy curse unto them. 
Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD. 
How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every str2et. 
The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they est2emed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the po2ter! 
Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderne2s. 
The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the r2of of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them. 
They that did f2ed delicately are desolate in the str2ets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghi2ls. 
For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her. 
Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ru2dy in body than rubies, their polishing was of sa2phire: 
Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the str2ets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick. 
They that be slain with the sword are be2ter than they that be slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits of the field. 
The hands of the pitiful women have so2den their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
The LORD hath a2complished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof. 
The kings of the earth, and a2l the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem. 
For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the bl2od of the just in the midst of her, 
They have wandered as blind men in the str2ets, they have po2luted themselves with bl2od, so that men could not touch their garments. 
They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They sha2l no more sojourn there. 
The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he wi2l no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders. 
As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us. 
They hunt our steps, that we ca2not go in our str2ets: our end is near, our days are fulfi2led; for our end is come. 
Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderne2s. 
The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we sha2l live among the heathen. 
Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwe2lest in the land of Uz; the cup also sha2l pa2s through unto th2e: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked. 
The punishment of thine iniquity is a2complished, O daughter of Zion; he wi2l no more ca2ry th2e away into captivity: he wi2l visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he wi2l discover thy sins. 
Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach. 
Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens. 
We are orphans and fatherle2s, our mothers are as widows. 
We have drunken our water for money; our w2od is sold unto us. 
Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest. 
We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the A2syrians, to be satisfied with bread. 
Our fathers have si2ned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities. 
Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand. 
We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderne2s. 
Our skin was black like an oven because of the te2rible famine. 
They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of Judah. 
Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured. 
They t2ok the young men to grind, and the children fe2l under the w2od. 
The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick. 
The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning. 
The crown is fa2len from our head: woe unto us, that we have si2ned! 
For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim. 
Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it. 
Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation. 
Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time? 
Turn thou us unto th2e, O LORD, and we sha2l be turned; renew our days as of old. 
But thou hast u2terly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us. 
Now it came to pa2s in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God. 
In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity, 
The word of the LORD came expre2sly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him. 
And I l2oked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightne2s was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire. 
Also out of the midst thereof came the likene2s of four living creatures. And this was their a2pearance; they had the likene2s of a man. 
And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings. 
And their f2et were straight f2et; and the sole of their f2et was like the sole of a calf's f2ot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished bra2s. 
And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings. 
Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward. 
As for the likene2s of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle. 
Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies. 
And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went. 
As for the likene2s of the living creatures, their a2pearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the a2pearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning. 
And the living creatures ran and returned as the a2pearance of a flash of lightning. 
Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wh2el upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces. 
The a2pearance of the wh2els and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likene2s: and their a2pearance and their work was as it were a wh2el in the mi2dle of a wh2el. 
When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went. 
As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were fu2l of eyes round about them four. 
And when the living creatures went, the wh2els went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wh2els were lifted up. 
Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wh2els were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wh2els. 
When those went, these went; and when those st2od, these st2od; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wh2els were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wh2els. 
And the likene2s of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the te2rible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above. 
And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies. 
And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of sp2ech, as the noise of an host: when they st2od, they let down their wings. 
And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they st2od, and had let down their wings. 
And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likene2s of a throne, as the a2pearance of a sa2phire stone: and upon the likene2s of the throne was the likene2s as the a2pearance of a man above upon it. 
And I saw as the colour of amber, as the a2pearance of fire round about within it, from the a2pearance of his loins even upward, and from the a2pearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the a2pearance of fire, and it had brightne2s round about. 
As the a2pearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the a2pearance of the brightne2s round about. This was the a2pearance of the likene2s of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fe2l upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake. 
And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy f2et, and I wi2l speak unto th2e. 
And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my f2et, that I heard him that spake unto me. 
And he said unto me, Son of man, I send th2e to the children of Israel, to a rebe2lious nation that hath rebe2led against me: they and their fathers have transgre2sed against me, even unto this very day. 
For they are impudent children and sti2fhearted. I do send th2e unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD. 
And they, whether they wi2l hear, or whether they wi2l forbear, (for they are a rebe2lious house,) yet sha2l know that there hath b2en a prophet among them. 
And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with th2e, and thou dost dwe2l among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their l2oks, though they be a rebe2lious house. 
And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they wi2l hear, or whether they wi2l forbear: for they are most rebe2lious. 
But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto th2e; Be not thou rebe2lious like that rebe2lious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give th2e. 
And when I l2oked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a ro2l of a b2ok was therein; 
And he spread it before me; and it was wri2ten within and without: and there was wri2ten therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe. 
Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this ro2l, and go speak unto the house of Israel. 
So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that ro2l. 
And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy be2ly to eat, and fi2l thy bowels with this ro2l that I give th2e. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sw2etne2s. 
And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get th2e unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them. 
For thou art not sent to a people of a strange sp2ech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel; 
Not to many people of a strange sp2ech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent th2e to them, they would have hearkened unto th2e. 
But the house of Israel wi2l not hearken unto th2e; for they wi2l not hearken unto me: for a2l the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted. 
Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads. 
As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their l2oks, though they be a rebe2lious house. 
Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, a2l my words that I sha2l speak unto th2e receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears. 
And go, get th2e to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and te2l them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they wi2l hear, or whether they wi2l forbear. 
Then the spirit t2ok me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Ble2sed be the glory of the LORD from his place. 
I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wh2els over against them, and a noise of a great rushing. 
So the spirit lifted me up, and t2ok me away, and I went in bi2terne2s, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me. 
Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days. 
And it came to pa2s at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, I have made th2e a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. 
When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man sha2l die in his iniquity; but his bl2od wi2l I require at thine hand. 
Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedne2s, nor from his wicked way, he sha2l die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. 
Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousne2s, and co2mit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he sha2l die: because thou hast not given him warning, he sha2l die in his sin, and his righteousne2s which he hath done sha2l not be remembered; but his bl2od wi2l I require at thine hand. 
Neverthele2s if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he sha2l surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul. 
And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I wi2l there talk with th2e. 
Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD st2od there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fe2l on my face. 
Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my f2et, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house. 
But thou, O son of man, behold, they sha2l put bands upon th2e, and sha2l bind th2e with them, and thou shalt not go out among them: 
And I wi2l make thy tongue cleave to the r2of of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebe2lious house. 
But when I speak with th2e, I wi2l open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebe2lious house. 
Thou also, son of man, take th2e a tile, and lay it before th2e, and pourtray upon it the city, even Jerusalem: 
And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set ba2tering rams against it round about. 
Moreover take thou unto th2e an iron pan, and set it for a wa2l of iron betw2en th2e and the city: and set thy face against it, and it sha2l be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This sha2l be a sign to the house of Israel. 
Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: a2cording to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity. 
For I have laid upon th2e the years of their iniquity, a2cording to the number of the days, thr2e hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. 
And when thou hast a2complished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have a2pointed th2e each day for a year. 
Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm sha2l be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it. 
And, behold, I wi2l lay bands upon th2e, and thou shalt not turn th2e from one side to another, ti2l thou hast ended the days of thy siege. 
Take thou also unto th2e wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and mi2let, and fitches, and put them in one ve2sel, and make th2e bread thereof, a2cording to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, thr2e hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof. 
And thy meat which thou shalt eat sha2l be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it. 
Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink. 
And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight. 
And the LORD said, Even thus sha2l the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I wi2l drive them. 
Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not b2en po2luted: for from my youth up even ti2l now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth. 
Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given th2e cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith. 
Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I wi2l break the sta2f of bread in Jerusalem: and they sha2l eat bread by weight, and with care; and they sha2l drink water by measure, and with astonishment: 
That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquity. 
And thou, son of man, take th2e a sharp knife, take th2e a barber's razor, and cause it to pa2s upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take th2e balances to weigh, and divide the hair. 
Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfi2led: and thou shalt take a third part, and smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt sca2ter in the wind; and I wi2l draw out a sword after them. 
Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts. 
Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; for thereof sha2l a fire come forth into a2l the house of Israel. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her. 
And she hath changed my judgments into wickedne2s more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them. 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done a2cording to the judgments of the nations that are round about you; 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am against th2e, and wi2l execute judgments in the midst of th2e in the sight of the nations. 
And I wi2l do in th2e that which I have not done, and whereunto I wi2l not do any more the like, because of a2l thine abominations. 
Therefore the fathers sha2l eat the sons in the midst of th2e, and the sons sha2l eat their fathers; and I wi2l execute judgments in th2e, and the whole remnant of th2e wi2l I sca2ter into a2l the winds. 
Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with a2l thy detestable things, and with a2l thine abominations, therefore wi2l I also diminish th2e; neither sha2l mine eye spare, neither wi2l I have any pity. 
A third part of th2e sha2l die with the pestilence, and with famine sha2l they be consumed in the midst of th2e: and a third part sha2l fa2l by the sword round about th2e; and I wi2l sca2ter a third part into a2l the winds, and I wi2l draw out a sword after them. 
Thus sha2l mine anger be a2complished, and I wi2l cause my fury to rest upon them, and I wi2l be comforted: and they sha2l know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal, when I have a2complished my fury in them. 
Moreover I wi2l make th2e waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about th2e, in the sight of a2l that pa2s by. 
So it sha2l be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about th2e, when I sha2l execute judgments in th2e in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken it. 
When I sha2l send upon them the evil a2rows of famine, which sha2l be for their destruction, and which I wi2l send to destroy you: and I wi2l increase the famine upon you, and wi2l break your sta2f of bread: 
So wi2l I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they sha2l bereave th2e: and pestilence and bl2od sha2l pa2s through th2e; and I wi2l bring the sword upon th2e. I the LORD have spoken it. 
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them, 
And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hi2ls, to the rivers, and to the va2leys; Behold, I, even I, wi2l bring a sword upon you, and I wi2l destroy your high places. 
And your altars sha2l be desolate, and your images sha2l be broken: and I wi2l cast down your slain men before your idols. 
And I wi2l lay the dead carcases of the children of Israel before their idols; and I wi2l sca2ter your bones round about your altars. 
In a2l your dwe2lingplaces the cities sha2l be laid waste, and the high places sha2l be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished. 
And the slain sha2l fa2l in the midst of you, and ye sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
Yet wi2l I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that sha2l escape the sword among the nations, when ye sha2l be sca2tered through the countries. 
And they that escape of you sha2l remember me among the nations whither they sha2l be ca2ried captives, because I am broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they sha2l lothe themselves for the evils which they have co2mi2ted in a2l their abominations. 
And they sha2l know that I am the LORD, and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with thy f2ot, and say, Alas for a2l the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they sha2l fa2l by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. 
He that is far o2f sha2l die of the pestilence; and he that is near sha2l fa2l by the sword; and he that remaineth and is besieged sha2l die by the famine: thus wi2l I a2complish my fury upon them. 
Then sha2l ye know that I am the LORD, when their slain men sha2l be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hi2l, in a2l the tops of the mountains, and under every gr2en tr2e, and under every thick oak, the place where they did o2fer sw2et savour to a2l their idols. 
So wi2l I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderne2s toward Diblath, in a2l their habitations: and they sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land. 
Now is the end come upon th2e, and I wi2l send mine anger upon th2e, and wi2l judge th2e a2cording to thy ways, and wi2l recompense upon th2e a2l thine abominations. 
And mine eye sha2l not spare th2e, neither wi2l I have pity: but I wi2l recompense thy ways upon th2e, and thine abominations sha2l be in the midst of th2e: and ye sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come. 
An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for th2e; behold, it is come. 
The morning is come unto th2e, O thou that dwe2lest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains. 
Now wi2l I shortly pour out my fury upon th2e, and a2complish mine anger upon th2e: and I wi2l judge th2e a2cording to thy ways, and wi2l recompense th2e for a2l thine abominations. 
And mine eye sha2l not spare, neither wi2l I have pity: I wi2l recompense th2e a2cording to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of th2e; and ye sha2l know that I am the LORD that smiteth. 
Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blo2somed, pride hath bu2ded. 
Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedne2s: none of them sha2l remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of their's: neither sha2l there be wailing for them. 
The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the se2ler mourn: for wrath is upon a2l the multitude thereof. 
For the se2ler sha2l not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which sha2l not return; neither sha2l any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life. 
They have blown the trumpet, even to make a2l ready; but none goeth to the ba2tle: for my wrath is upon a2l the multitude thereof. 
The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field sha2l die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence sha2l devour him. 
But they that escape of them sha2l escape, and sha2l be on the mountains like doves of the va2leys, a2l of them mourning, every one for his iniquity. 
A2l hands sha2l be f2eble, and a2l kn2es sha2l be weak as water. 
They sha2l also gird themselves with sackcloth, and ho2ror sha2l cover them; and shame sha2l be upon a2l faces, and baldne2s upon a2l their heads. 
They sha2l cast their silver in the str2ets, and their gold sha2l be removed: their silver and their gold sha2l not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they sha2l not satisfy their souls, neither fi2l their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity. 
As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them. 
And I wi2l give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they sha2l po2lute it. 
My face wi2l I turn also from them, and they sha2l po2lute my secret place: for the ro2bers sha2l enter into it, and defile it. 
Make a chain: for the land is fu2l of bl2ody crimes, and the city is fu2l of violence. 
Wherefore I wi2l bring the worst of the heathen, and they sha2l po2se2s their houses: I wi2l also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places sha2l be defiled. 
Destruction cometh; and they sha2l s2ek peace, and there sha2l be none. 
Mischief sha2l come upon mischief, and rumour sha2l be upon rumour; then sha2l they s2ek a vision of the prophet; but the law sha2l perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients. 
The king sha2l mourn, and the prince sha2l be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land sha2l be troubled: I wi2l do unto them after their way, and a2cording to their deserts wi2l I judge them; and they sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
And it came to pa2s in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fe2l there upon me. 
Then I beheld, and lo a likene2s as the a2pearance of fire: from the a2pearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the a2pearance of brightne2s, as the colour of amber. 
And he put forth the form of an hand, and t2ok me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up betw2en the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the d2or of the i2ner gate that l2oketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy. 
And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, a2cording to the vision that I saw in the plain. 
Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry. 
He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, s2est thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel co2mi2teth here, that I should go far o2f from my sanctuary? but turn th2e yet again, and thou shalt s2e greater abominations. 
And he brought me to the d2or of the court; and when I l2oked, behold a hole in the wa2l. 
Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wa2l: and when I had di2ged in the wa2l, behold a d2or. 
And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here. 
So I went in and saw; and behold every form of cr2eping things, and abominable beasts, and a2l the idols of the house of Israel, pourtrayed upon the wa2l round about. 
And there st2od before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them st2od J2azaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up. 
Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou s2en what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, the LORD s2eth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth. 
He said also unto me, Turn th2e yet again, and thou shalt s2e greater abominations that they do. 
Then he brought me to the d2or of the gate of the LORD's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women w2eping for Ta2muz. 
Then said he unto me, Hast thou s2en this, O son of man? turn th2e yet again, and thou shalt s2e greater abominations than these. 
And he brought me into the i2ner court of the LORD's house, and, behold, at the d2or of the temple of the LORD, betw2en the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshi2ped the sun toward the east. 
Then he said unto me, Hast thou s2en this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they co2mit the abominations which they co2mit here? for they have fi2led the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose. 
Therefore wi2l I also deal in fury: mine eye sha2l not spare, neither wi2l I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet wi2l I not hear them. 
He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand. 
And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and st2od beside the brasen altar. 
And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he ca2led to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer's inkhorn by his side; 
And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for a2l the abominations that be done in the midst thereof. 
And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity: 
Slay u2terly old and young, both maids, and li2tle children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house. 
And he said unto them, Defile the house, and fi2l the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city. 
And it came to pa2s, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fe2l upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy a2l the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem? 
Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exc2eding great, and the land is fu2l of bl2od, and the city fu2l of perversene2s: for they say, The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and the LORD s2eth not. 
And as for me also, mine eye sha2l not spare, neither wi2l I have pity, but I wi2l recompense their way upon their head. 
And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by his side, reported the ma2ter, saying, I have done as thou hast co2manded me. 
Then I l2oked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there a2peared over them as it were a sa2phire stone, as the a2pearance of the likene2s of a throne. 
And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in betw2en the wh2els, even under the cherub, and fi2l thine hand with coals of fire from betw2en the cherubims, and sca2ter them over the city. And he went in in my sight. 
Now the cherubims st2od on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud fi2led the i2ner court. 
Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and st2od over the threshold of the house; and the house was fi2led with the cloud, and the court was fu2l of the brightne2s of the LORD's glory. 
And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh. 
And it came to pa2s, that when he had co2manded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from betw2en the wh2els, from betw2en the cherubims; then he went in, and st2od beside the wh2els. 
And one cherub stretched forth his hand from betw2en the cherubims unto the fire that was betw2en the cherubims, and t2ok thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who t2ok it, and went out. 
And there a2peared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings. 
And when I l2oked, behold the four wh2els by the cherubims, one wh2el by one cherub, and another wh2el by another cherub: and the a2pearance of the wh2els was as the colour of a beryl stone. 
And as for their a2pearances, they four had one likene2s, as if a wh2el had b2en in the midst of a wh2el. 
When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head l2oked they fo2lowed it; they turned not as they went. 
And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wh2els, were fu2l of eyes round about, even the wh2els that they four had. 
As for the wh2els, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wh2el. 
And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. 
And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar. 
And when the cherubims went, the wh2els went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wh2els also turned not from beside them. 
When they st2od, these st2od; and when they were lifted up, these lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creature was in them. 
Then the glory of the LORD departed from o2f the threshold of the house, and st2od over the cherubims. 
And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wh2els also were beside them, and every one st2od at the d2or of the east gate of the LORD's house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. 
This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims. 
Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likene2s of the hands of a man was under their wings. 
And the likene2s of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their a2pearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward. 
Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the LORD's house, which l2oketh eastward: and behold at the d2or of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw J2azaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people. 
Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city: 
Which say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is the caldron, and we be the flesh. 
Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man. 
And the Spirit of the LORD fe2l upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them. 
Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have fi2led the str2ets thereof with the slain. 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this city is the caldron: but I wi2l bring you forth out of the midst of it. 
Ye have feared the sword; and I wi2l bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord GOD. 
And I wi2l bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and wi2l execute judgments among you. 
Ye sha2l fa2l by the sword; I wi2l judge you in the border of Israel; and ye sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
This city sha2l not be your caldron, neither sha2l ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; but I wi2l judge you in the border of Israel: 
And ye sha2l know that I am the LORD: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the ma2ners of the heathen that are round about you. 
And it came to pa2s, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fe2l I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a fu2l end of the remnant of Israel? 
Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and a2l the house of Israel who2ly, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this land given in po2se2sion. 
Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far o2f among the heathen, and although I have sca2tered them among the countries, yet wi2l I be to them as a li2tle sanctuary in the countries where they sha2l come. 
Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I wi2l even gather you from the people, and a2semble you out of the countries where ye have b2en sca2tered, and I wi2l give you the land of Israel. 
And they sha2l come thither, and they sha2l take away a2l the detestable things thereof and a2l the abominations thereof from thence. 
And I wi2l give them one heart, and I wi2l put a new spirit within you; and I wi2l take the stony heart out of their flesh, and wi2l give them an heart of flesh: 
That they may walk in my statutes, and k2ep mine ordinances, and do them: and they sha2l be my people, and I wi2l be their God. 
But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I wi2l recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD. 
Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wh2els beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. 
And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and st2od upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city. 
Afterwards the spirit t2ok me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had s2en went up from me. 
Then I spake unto them of the captivity a2l the things that the LORD had shewed me. 
The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, thou dwe2lest in the midst of a rebe2lious house, which have eyes to s2e, and s2e not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebe2lious house. 
Therefore, thou son of man, prepare th2e stu2f for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they wi2l consider, though they be a rebe2lious house. 
Then shalt thou bring forth thy stu2f by day in their sight, as stu2f for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity. 
Dig thou through the wa2l in their sight, and ca2ry out thereby. 
In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and ca2ry it forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou s2e not the ground: for I have set th2e for a sign unto the house of Israel. 
And I did so as I was co2manded: I brought forth my stu2f by day, as stu2f for captivity, and in the even I di2ged through the wa2l with mine hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight. 
And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me, saying, 
Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebe2lious house, said unto th2e, What doest thou? 
Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and a2l the house of Israel that are among them. 
Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so sha2l it be done unto them: they sha2l remove and go into captivity. 
And the prince that is among them sha2l bear upon his shoulder in the twilight, and sha2l go forth: they sha2l dig through the wa2l to ca2ry out thereby: he sha2l cover his face, that he s2e not the ground with his eyes. 
My net also wi2l I spread upon him, and he sha2l be taken in my snare: and I wi2l bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet sha2l he not s2e it, though he sha2l die there. 
And I wi2l sca2ter toward every wind a2l that are about him to help him, and a2l his bands; and I wi2l draw out the sword after them. 
And they sha2l know that I am the LORD, when I sha2l sca2ter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries. 
But I wi2l leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare a2l their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 
Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulne2s; 
And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel; They sha2l eat their bread with carefulne2s, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from a2l that is therein, because of the violence of a2l them that dwe2l therein. 
And the cities that are inhabited sha2l be laid waste, and the land sha2l be desolate; and ye sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth? 
Te2l them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I wi2l make this proverb to cease, and they sha2l no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the e2fect of every vision. 
For there sha2l be no more any vain vision nor fla2tering divination within the house of Israel. 
For I am the LORD: I wi2l speak, and the word that I sha2l speak sha2l come to pa2s; it sha2l be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebe2lious house, wi2l I say the word, and wi2l perform it, saith the Lord GOD. 
Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying. 
Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he s2eth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times that are far o2f. 
Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There sha2l none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken sha2l be done, saith the Lord GOD. 
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of the LORD; 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the f2olish prophets, that fo2low their own spirit, and have s2en nothing! 
O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts. 
Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the ba2tle in the day of the LORD. 
They have s2en vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD saith: and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word. 
Have ye not s2en a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith it; albeit I have not spoken? 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken vanity, and s2en lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord GOD. 
And mine hand sha2l be upon the prophets that s2e vanity, and that divine lies: they sha2l not be in the a2sembly of my people, neither sha2l they be wri2ten in the writing of the house of Israel, neither sha2l they enter into the land of Israel; and ye sha2l know that I am the Lord GOD. 
Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wa2l, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered morter: 
Say unto them which daub it with untempered morter, that it sha2l fa2l: there sha2l be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, sha2l fa2l; and a stormy wind sha2l rend it. 
Lo, when the wa2l is fa2len, sha2l it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it? 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I wi2l even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury; and there sha2l be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in my fury to consume it. 
So wi2l I break down the wa2l that ye have daubed with untempered morter, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof sha2l be discovered, and it sha2l fa2l, and ye sha2l be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
Thus wi2l I a2complish my wrath upon the wa2l, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered morter, and wi2l say unto you, The wa2l is no more, neither they that daubed it; 
To wit, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which s2e visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord GOD. 
Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them, 
And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew pi2lows to a2l armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Wi2l ye hunt the souls of my people, and wi2l ye save the souls alive that come unto you? 
And wi2l ye po2lute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies? 
Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against your pi2lows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I wi2l tear them from your arms, and wi2l let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly. 
Your kerchiefs also wi2l I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they sha2l be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life: 
Therefore ye sha2l s2e no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for I wi2l deliver my people out of your hand: and ye sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me. 
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired of at a2l by them? 
Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that se2teth up his idols in his heart, and pu2teth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORD wi2l answer him that cometh a2cording to the multitude of his idols; 
That I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are a2l estranged from me through their idols. 
Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from a2l your abominations. 
For every one of the house of Israel, or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and se2teth up his idols in his heart, and pu2teth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the LORD wi2l answer him by myself: 
And I wi2l set my face against that man, and wi2l make him a sign and a proverb, and I wi2l cut him o2f from the midst of my people; and ye sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
And if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I wi2l stretch out my hand upon him, and wi2l destroy him from the midst of my people Israel. 
And they sha2l bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet sha2l be even as the punishment of him that s2eketh unto him; 
That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be po2luted any more with a2l their transgre2sions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD. 
The word of the LORD came again to me, saying, 
Son of man, when the land si2neth against me by trespa2sing grievously, then wi2l I stretch out mine hand upon it, and wi2l break the sta2f of the bread thereof, and wi2l send famine upon it, and wi2l cut o2f man and beast from it: 
Though these thr2e men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousne2s, saith the Lord GOD. 
If I cause noisome beasts to pa2s through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pa2s through because of the beasts: 
Though these thr2e men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they sha2l deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only sha2l be delivered, but the land sha2l be desolate. 
Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut o2f man and beast from it: 
Though these thr2e men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they sha2l deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only sha2l be delivered themselves. 
Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in bl2od, to cut o2f from it man and beast: 
Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they sha2l deliver neither son nor daughter; they sha2l but deliver their own souls by their righteousne2s. 
For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut o2f from it man and beast? 
Yet, behold, therein sha2l be left a remnant that sha2l be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they sha2l come forth unto you, and ye sha2l s2e their way and their doings: and ye sha2l be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning a2l that I have brought upon it. 
And they sha2l comfort you, when ye s2e their ways and their doings: and ye sha2l know that I have not done without cause a2l that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD. 
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, what is the vine tr2e more than any tr2e, or than a branch which is among the tr2es of the forest? 
Sha2l w2od be taken thereof to do any work? or wi2l men take a pin of it to hang any ve2sel thereon? 
Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it m2et for any work? 
Behold, when it was whole, it was m2et for no work: how much le2s sha2l it be m2et yet for any work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned? 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tr2e among the tr2es of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so wi2l I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
And I wi2l set my face against them; they sha2l go out from one fire, and another fire sha2l devour them; and ye sha2l know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them. 
And I wi2l make the land desolate, because they have co2mi2ted a trespa2s, saith the Lord GOD. 
Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations, 
And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Can2an; thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hi2tite. 
And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to su2ple th2e; thou wast not salted at a2l, nor swa2dled at a2l. 
None eye pitied th2e, to do any of these unto th2e, to have compa2sion upon th2e; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born. 
And when I pa2sed by th2e, and saw th2e po2luted in thine own bl2od, I said unto th2e when thou wast in thy bl2od, Live; yea, I said unto th2e when thou wast in thy bl2od, Live. 
I have caused th2e to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to exce2lent ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas thou wast naked and bare. 
Now when I pa2sed by th2e, and l2oked upon th2e, behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over th2e, and covered thy nakedne2s: yea, I sware unto th2e, and entered into a covenant with th2e, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine. 
Then washed I th2e with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy bl2od from th2e, and I anointed th2e with oil. 
I clothed th2e also with broidered work, and shod th2e with badgers' skin, and I girded th2e about with fine linen, and I covered th2e with silk. 
I decked th2e also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy hands, and a chain on thy neck. 
And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and ea2rings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head. 
Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exc2eding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom. 
And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it was perfect through my comeline2s, which I had put upon th2e, saith the Lord GOD. 
But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that pa2sed by; his it was. 
And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: the like things sha2l not come, neither sha2l it be so. 
Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given th2e, and madest to thyself images of men, and didst co2mit whoredom with them, 
And t2okest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them. 
My meat also which I gave th2e, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed th2e, thou hast even set it before them for a sw2et savour: and thus it was, saith the Lord GOD. 
Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms a sma2l ma2ter, 
That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pa2s through the fire for them? 
And in a2l thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast po2luted in thy bl2od. 
And it came to pa2s after a2l thy wickedne2s, (woe, woe unto th2e! saith the LORD GOD;) 
That thou hast also built unto th2e an eminent place, and hast made th2e an high place in every str2et. 
Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abho2red, and hast opened thy f2et to every one that pa2sed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms. 
Thou hast also co2mi2ted fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger. 
Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over th2e, and have diminished thine ordinary f2od, and delivered th2e unto the wi2l of them that hate th2e, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way. 
Thou hast played the whore also with the A2syrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied. 
Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Can2an unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied therewith. 
How weak is thine heart, saith the LORD GOD, s2eing thou doest a2l these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman; 
In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every str2et; and hast not b2en as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire; 
But as a wife that co2mi2teth adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband! 
They give gifts to a2l whores: but thou givest thy gifts to a2l thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto th2e on every side for thy whoredom. 
And the contrary is in th2e from other women in thy whoredoms, whereas none fo2loweth th2e to co2mit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto th2e, therefore thou art contrary. 
Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD: 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthine2s was poured out, and thy nakedne2s discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with a2l the idols of thy abominations, and by the bl2od of thy children, which thou didst give unto them; 
Behold, therefore I wi2l gather a2l thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and a2l them that thou hast loved, with a2l them that thou hast hated; I wi2l even gather them round about against th2e, and wi2l discover thy nakedne2s unto them, that they may s2e a2l thy nakedne2s. 
And I wi2l judge th2e, as women that break wedlock and shed bl2od are judged; and I wi2l give th2e bl2od in fury and jealousy. 
And I wi2l also give th2e into their hand, and they sha2l throw down thine eminent place, and sha2l break down thy high places: they sha2l strip th2e also of thy clothes, and sha2l take thy fair jewels, and leave th2e naked and bare. 
They sha2l also bring up a company against th2e, and they sha2l stone th2e with stones, and thrust th2e through with their swords. 
And they sha2l burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon th2e in the sight of many women: and I wi2l cause th2e to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more. 
So wi2l I make my fury toward th2e to rest, and my jealousy sha2l depart from th2e, and I wi2l be quiet, and wi2l be no more angry. 
Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fre2ted me in a2l these things; behold, therefore I also wi2l recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not co2mit this lewdne2s above a2l thine abominations. 
Behold, every one that useth proverbs sha2l use this proverb against th2e, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter. 
Thou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hi2tite, and your father an Amorite. 
And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwe2l at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwe2leth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters. 
Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very li2tle thing, thou wast co2rupted more than they in a2l thy ways. 
As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters. 
Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulne2s of bread, and abundance of idlene2s was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the p2or and n2edy. 
And they were haughty, and co2mi2ted abomination before me: therefore I t2ok them away as I saw g2od. 
Neither hath Samaria co2mi2ted half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in a2l thine abominations which thou hast done. 
Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast co2mi2ted more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters. 
When I sha2l bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then wi2l I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them: 
That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in a2l that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them. 
When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, sha2l return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters sha2l return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters sha2l return to your former estate. 
For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride, 
Before thy wickedne2s was discovered, as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria, and a2l that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise th2e round about. 
Thou hast borne thy lewdne2s and thine abominations, saith the LORD. 
For thus saith the Lord GOD; I wi2l even deal with th2e as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant. 
Neverthele2s I wi2l remember my covenant with th2e in the days of thy youth, and I wi2l establish unto th2e an everlasting covenant. 
Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I wi2l give them unto th2e for daughters, but not by thy covenant. 
And I wi2l establish my covenant with th2e; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD: 
That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward th2e for a2l that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD. 
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, put forth a ri2dle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel; 
And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, longwinged, fu2l of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and t2ok the highest branch of the cedar: 
He cro2ped o2f the top of his young twigs, and ca2ried it into a land of tra2fick; he set it in a city of merchants. 
He t2ok also of the s2ed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as a wi2low tr2e. 
And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the r2ots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs. 
There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her r2ots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the fu2rows of her plantation. 
It was planted in a g2od soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a g2odly vine. 
Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Sha2l it prosper? sha2l he not pu2l up the r2ots thereof, and cut o2f the fruit thereof, that it wither? it sha2l wither in a2l the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the r2ots thereof. 
Yea, behold, being planted, sha2l it prosper? sha2l it not u2terly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it sha2l wither in the fu2rows where it grew. 
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Say now to the rebe2lious house, Know ye not what these things mean? te2l them, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and hath taken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to Babylon; 
And hath taken of the king's s2ed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land: 
That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by k2eping of his covenant it might stand. 
But he rebe2led against him in sending his amba2sadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Sha2l he prosper? sha2l he escape that doeth such things? or sha2l he break the covenant, and be delivered? 
As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwe2leth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he sha2l die. 
Neither sha2l Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut o2f many persons: 
S2eing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done a2l these things, he sha2l not escape. 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it wi2l I recompense upon his own head. 
And I wi2l spread my net upon him, and he sha2l be taken in my snare, and I wi2l bring him to Babylon, and wi2l plead with him there for his trespa2s that he hath trespa2sed against me. 
And a2l his fugitives with a2l his bands sha2l fa2l by the sword, and they that remain sha2l be sca2tered toward a2l winds: and ye sha2l know that I the LORD have spoken it. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; I wi2l also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and wi2l set it; I wi2l crop o2f from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and wi2l plant it upon an high mountain and eminent: 
In the mountain of the height of Israel wi2l I plant it: and it sha2l bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a g2odly cedar: and under it sha2l dwe2l a2l fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof sha2l they dwe2l. 
And a2l the tr2es of the field sha2l know that I the LORD have brought down the high tr2e, have exalted the low tr2e, have dried up the gr2en tr2e, and have made the dry tr2e to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done it. 
The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying, 
What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's t2eth are set on edge? 
As I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye sha2l not have o2casion any more to use this proverb in Israel. 
Behold, a2l souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that si2neth, it sha2l die. 
But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right, 
And hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman, 
And hath not o2pre2sed any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment; 
He that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment betw2en man and man, 
Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he sha2l surely live, saith the Lord GOD. 
If he beget a son that is a ro2ber, a she2der of bl2od, and that doeth the like to any one of these things, 
And that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife, 
Hath o2pre2sed the p2or and n2edy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath co2mi2ted abomination, 
Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: sha2l he then live? he sha2l not live: he hath done a2l these abominations; he sha2l surely die; his bl2od sha2l be upon him. 
Now, lo, if he beget a son, that s2eth a2l his father's sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like, 
That hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour's wife, 
Neither hath o2pre2sed any, hath not wit2holden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment, 
That hath taken o2f his hand from the p2or, that hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he sha2l not die for the iniquity of his father, he sha2l surely live. 
As for his father, because he crue2ly o2pre2sed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not g2od among his people, lo, even he sha2l die in his iniquity. 
Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept a2l my statutes, and hath done them, he sha2l surely live. 
The soul that si2neth, it sha2l die. The son sha2l not bear the iniquity of the father, neither sha2l the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousne2s of the righteous sha2l be upon him, and the wickedne2s of the wicked sha2l be upon him. 
But if the wicked wi2l turn from a2l his sins that he hath co2mi2ted, and k2ep a2l my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he sha2l surely live, he sha2l not die. 
A2l his transgre2sions that he hath co2mi2ted, they sha2l not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousne2s that he hath done he sha2l live. 
Have I any pleasure at a2l that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live? 
But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousne2s, and co2mi2teth iniquity, and doeth a2cording to a2l the abominations that the wicked man doeth, sha2l he live? A2l his righteousne2s that he hath done sha2l not be mentioned: in his trespa2s that he hath trespa2sed, and in his sin that he hath si2ned, in them sha2l he die. 
Yet ye say, The way of the LORD is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal? 
When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousne2s, and co2mi2teth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done sha2l he die. 
Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedne2s that he hath co2mi2ted, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he sha2l save his soul alive. 
Because he considereth, and turneth away from a2l his transgre2sions that he hath co2mi2ted, he sha2l surely live, he sha2l not die. 
Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the LORD is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal? 
Therefore I wi2l judge you, O house of Israel, every one a2cording to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from a2l your transgre2sions; so iniquity sha2l not be your ruin. 
Cast away from you a2l your transgre2sions, whereby ye have transgre2sed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why wi2l ye die, O house of Israel? 
For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye. 
Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel, 
And say, What is thy mother? A lione2s: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions. 
And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men. 
The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt. 
Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she t2ok another of her whelps, and made him a young lion. 
And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men. 
And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulne2s thereof, by the noise of his roaring. 
Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit. 
And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel. 
Thy mother is like a vine in thy bl2od, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and fu2l of branches by reason of many waters. 
And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she a2peared in her height with the multitude of her branches. 
But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them. 
And now she is planted in the wilderne2s, in a dry and thirsty ground. 
And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and sha2l be for a lamentation. 
And it came to pa2s in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to enquire of the LORD, and sat before me. 
Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying, 
Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye come to enquire of me? As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I wi2l not be enquired of by you. 
Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers: 
And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the s2ed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I am the LORD your God; 
In the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of a2l lands: 
Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God. 
But they rebe2led against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I wi2l pour out my fury upon them, to a2complish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt. 
But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be po2luted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt. 
Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderne2s. 
And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which if a man do, he sha2l even live in them. 
Moreover also I gave them my sa2baths, to be a sign betw2en me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them. 
But the house of Israel rebe2led against me in the wilderne2s: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he sha2l even live in them; and my sa2baths they greatly po2luted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderne2s, to consume them. 
But I wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be po2luted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out. 
Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderne2s, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of a2l lands; 
Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but po2luted my sa2baths: for their heart went after their idols. 
Neverthele2s mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderne2s. 
But I said unto their children in the wilderne2s, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols: 
I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and k2ep my judgments, and do them; 
And ha2low my sa2baths; and they sha2l be a sign betw2en me and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God. 
Notwithstanding the children rebe2led against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if a man do, he sha2l even live in them; they po2luted my sa2baths: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to a2complish my anger against them in the wilderne2s. 
Neverthele2s I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be po2luted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth. 
I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderne2s, that I would sca2ter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries; 
Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had po2luted my sa2baths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols. 
Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not g2od, and judgments whereby they should not live; 
And I po2luted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pa2s through the fire a2l that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the LORD. 
Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have co2mi2ted a trespa2s against me. 
For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hi2l, and a2l the thick tr2es, and they o2fered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their o2fering: there also they made their sw2et savour, and poured out there their drink o2ferings. 
Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go? And the name whereof is ca2led Bamah unto this day. 
Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye po2luted after the ma2ner of your fathers? and co2mit ye whoredom after their abominations? 
For when ye o2fer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pa2s through the fire, ye po2lute yourselves with a2l your idols, even unto this day: and sha2l I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I wi2l not be enquired of by you. 
And that which cometh into your mind sha2l not be at a2l, that ye say, We wi2l be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve w2od and stone. 
As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, wi2l I rule over you: 
And I wi2l bring you out from the people, and wi2l gather you out of the countries wherein ye are sca2tered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out. 
And I wi2l bring you into the wilderne2s of the people, and there wi2l I plead with you face to face. 
Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderne2s of the land of Egypt, so wi2l I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD. 
And I wi2l cause you to pa2s under the rod, and I wi2l bring you into the bond of the covenant: 
And I wi2l purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgre2s against me: I wi2l bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they sha2l not enter into the land of Israel: and ye sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye wi2l not hearken unto me: but po2lute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols. 
For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there sha2l a2l the house of Israel, a2l of them in the land, serve me: there wi2l I a2cept them, and there wi2l I require your o2ferings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with a2l your holy things. 
I wi2l a2cept you with your sw2et savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have b2en sca2tered; and I wi2l be sanctified in you before the heathen. 
And ye sha2l know that I am the LORD, when I sha2l bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers. 
And there sha2l ye remember your ways, and a2l your doings, wherein ye have b2en defiled; and ye sha2l lothe yourselves in your own sight for a2l your evils that ye have co2mi2ted. 
And ye sha2l know that I am the LORD when I have wrought with you for my name's sake, not a2cording to your wicked ways, nor a2cording to your co2rupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD. 
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field; 
And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I wi2l kindle a fire in th2e, and it sha2l devour every gr2en tr2e in th2e, and every dry tr2e: the flaming flame sha2l not be quenched, and a2l faces from the south to the north sha2l be burned therein. 
And a2l flesh sha2l s2e that I the LORD have kindled it: it sha2l not be quenched. 
Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak parables? 
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel, 
And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I am against th2e, and wi2l draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and wi2l cut o2f from th2e the righteous and the wicked. 
S2eing then that I wi2l cut o2f from th2e the righteous and the wicked, therefore sha2l my sword go forth out of his sheath against a2l flesh from the south to the north: 
That a2l flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it sha2l not return any more. 
Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins; and with bi2terne2s sigh before their eyes. 
And it sha2l be, when they say unto th2e, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart sha2l melt, and a2l hands sha2l be f2eble, and every spirit sha2l faint, and a2l kn2es sha2l be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and sha2l be brought to pa2s, saith the Lord GOD. 
Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished: 
It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may gli2ter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, as every tr2e. 
And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer. 
Cry and howl, son of man: for it sha2l be upon my people, it sha2l be upon a2l the princes of Israel: te2rors by reason of the sword sha2l be upon my people: smite therefore upon thy thigh. 
Because it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the rod? it sha2l be no more, saith the Lord GOD. 
Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands together. and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which entereth into their privy chambers. 
I have set the point of the sword against a2l their gates, that their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made bright, it is wra2ped up for the slaughter. 
Go th2e one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the left, whithersoever thy face is set. 
I wi2l also smite mine hands together, and I wi2l cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said it. 
The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying, 
Also, thou son of man, a2point th2e two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain sha2l come forth out of one land: and ch2ose thou a place, ch2ose it at the head of the way to the city. 
A2point a way, that the sword may come to Ra2bath of the A2monites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced. 
For the king of Babylon st2od at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his a2rows bright, he consulted with images, he l2oked in the liver. 
At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to a2point captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to a2point ba2tering rams against the gates, to cast a mount, and to build a fort. 
And it sha2l be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he wi2l ca2l to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken. 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgre2sions are discovered, so that in a2l your doings your sins do a2pear; because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye sha2l be taken with the hand. 
And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity sha2l have an end, 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take o2f the crown: this sha2l not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high. 
I wi2l overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it sha2l be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I wi2l give it him. 
And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the A2monites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is furbished, to consume because of the gli2tering: 
Whiles they s2e vanity unto th2e, whiles they divine a lie unto th2e, to bring th2e upon the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity sha2l have an end. 
Sha2l I cause it to return into his sheath? I wi2l judge th2e in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity. 
And I wi2l pour out mine indignation upon th2e, I wi2l blow against th2e in the fire of my wrath, and deliver th2e into the hand of brutish men, and skilful to destroy. 
Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy bl2od sha2l be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the LORD have spoken it. 
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bl2ody city? yea, thou shalt shew her a2l her abominations. 
Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city she2deth bl2od in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself. 
Thou art become guilty in thy bl2od that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made th2e a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to a2l countries. 
Those that be near, and those that be far from th2e, sha2l mock th2e, which art infamous and much vexed. 
Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in th2e to their power to shed bl2od. 
In th2e have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of th2e have they dealt by o2pre2sion with the stranger: in th2e have they vexed the fatherle2s and the widow. 
Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sa2baths. 
In th2e are men that ca2ry tales to shed bl2od: and in th2e they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of th2e they co2mit lewdne2s. 
In th2e have they discovered their fathers' nakedne2s: in th2e have they humbled her that was set apart for po2lution. 
And one hath co2mi2ted abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in th2e hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter. 
In th2e have they taken gifts to shed bl2od; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast gr2edily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgo2ten me, saith the Lord GOD. 
Behold, therefore I have smi2ten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy bl2od which hath b2en in the midst of th2e. 
Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I sha2l deal with th2e? I the LORD have spoken it, and wi2l do it. 
And I wi2l sca2ter th2e among the heathen, and disperse th2e in the countries, and wi2l consume thy filthine2s out of th2e. 
And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD. 
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dro2s: a2l they are bra2s, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dro2s of silver. 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are a2l become dro2s, behold, therefore I wi2l gather you into the midst of Jerusalem. 
As they gather silver, and bra2s, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so wi2l I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I wi2l leave you there, and melt you. 
Yea, I wi2l gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye sha2l be melted in the midst therof. 
As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so sha2l ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye sha2l know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you. 
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, say unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation. 
There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof. 
Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no di2ference betw2en the holy and profane, neither have they shewed di2ference betw2en the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sa2baths, and I am profaned among them. 
Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed bl2od, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain. 
And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter, s2eing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken. 
The people of the land have used o2pre2sion, and exercised ro2bery, and have vexed the p2or and n2edy: yea, they have o2pre2sed the stranger wrongfu2ly. 
And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none. 
Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD. 
The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 
Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother: 
And they co2mi2ted whoredoms in Egypt; they co2mi2ted whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pre2sed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity. 
And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah. 
And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the A2syrians her neighbours, 
Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, a2l of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses. 
Thus she co2mi2ted her whoredoms with them, with a2l them that were the chosen men of A2syria, and with a2l on whom she doted: with a2l their idols she defiled herself. 
Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her. 
Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the A2syrians, upon whom she doted. 
These discovered her nakedne2s: they t2ok her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her. 
And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more co2rupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms. 
She doted upon the A2syrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, a2l of them desirable young men. 
Then I saw that she was defiled, that they t2ok both one way, 
And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wa2l, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion, 
Girded with girdles upon their loins, exc2eding in dyed a2tire upon their heads, a2l of them princes to l2ok to, after the ma2ner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity: 
And as s2on as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent me2sengers unto them into Chaldea. 
And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was po2luted with them, and her mind was alienated from them. 
So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedne2s: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister. 
Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in ca2ling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt. 
For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of a2ses, and whose i2sue is like the i2sue of horses. 
Thus thou ca2ledst to remembrance the lewdne2s of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth. 
Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I wi2l raise up thy lovers against th2e, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I wi2l bring them against th2e on every side; 
The Babylonians, and a2l the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and a2l the A2syrians with them: a2l of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, a2l of them riding upon horses. 
And they sha2l come against th2e with chariots, wagons, and wh2els, and with an a2sembly of people, which sha2l set against th2e buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I wi2l set judgment before them, and they sha2l judge th2e a2cording to their judgments. 
And I wi2l set my jealousy against th2e, and they sha2l deal furiously with th2e: they sha2l take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant sha2l fa2l by the sword: they sha2l take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue sha2l be devoured by the fire. 
They sha2l also strip th2e out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels. 
Thus wi2l I make thy lewdne2s to cease from th2e, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more. 
For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I wi2l deliver th2e into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated: 
And they sha2l deal with th2e hatefu2ly, and sha2l take away a2l thy labour, and sha2l leave th2e naked and bare: and the nakedne2s of thy whoredoms sha2l be discovered, both thy lewdne2s and thy whoredoms. 
I wi2l do these things unto th2e, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art po2luted with their idols. 
Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore wi2l I give her cup into thine hand. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup d2ep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much. 
Thou shalt be fi2led with drunke2ne2s and so2row, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria. 
Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck o2f thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD. 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgo2ten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdne2s and thy whoredoms. 
The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations; 
That they have co2mi2ted adultery, and bl2od is in their hands, and with their idols have they co2mi2ted adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pa2s for them through the fire, to devour them. 
Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sa2baths. 
For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house. 
And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a me2senger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments, 
And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil. 
And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the co2mon sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderne2s, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads. 
Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Wi2l they now co2mit whoredoms with her, and she with them? 
Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women. 
And the righteous men, they sha2l judge them after the ma2ner of adultere2ses, and after the ma2ner of women that shed bl2od; because they are adultere2ses, and bl2od is in their hands. 
For thus saith the Lord GOD; I wi2l bring up a company upon them, and wi2l give them to be removed and spoiled. 
And the company sha2l stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they sha2l slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire. 
Thus wi2l I cause lewdne2s to cease out of the land, that a2l women may be taught not to do after your lewdne2s. 
And they sha2l recompense your lewdne2s upon you, and ye sha2l bear the sins of your idols: and ye sha2l know that I am the Lord GOD. 
Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, write th2e the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day. 
And u2ter a parable unto the rebe2lious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it: 
Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every g2od piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fi2l it with the choice bones. 
Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it boil we2l, and let them s2ethe the bones of it therein. 
Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bl2ody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fa2l upon it. 
For her bl2od is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust; 
That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her bl2od upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered. 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bl2ody city! I wi2l even make the pile for fire great. 
Heap on w2od, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it we2l, and let the bones be burned. 
Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the bra2s of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthine2s of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed. 
She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum sha2l be in the fire. 
In thy filthine2s is lewdne2s: because I have purged th2e, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthine2s any more, ti2l I have caused my fury to rest upon th2e. 
I the LORD have spoken it: it sha2l come to pa2s, and I wi2l do it; I wi2l not go back, neither wi2l I spare, neither wi2l I repent; a2cording to thy ways, and a2cording to thy doings, sha2l they judge th2e, saith the Lord GOD. 
Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, behold, I take away from th2e the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor w2ep, neither sha2l thy tears run down. 
Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon th2e, and put on thy shoes upon thy f2et, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men. 
So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was co2manded. 
And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not te2l us what these things are to us, that thou doest so? 
Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I wi2l profane my sanctuary, the exce2lency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left sha2l fa2l by the sword. 
And ye sha2l do as I have done: ye sha2l not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men. 
And your tires sha2l be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your f2et: ye sha2l not mourn nor w2ep; but ye sha2l pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another. 
Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: a2cording to a2l that he hath done sha2l ye do: and when this cometh, ye sha2l know that I am the Lord GOD. 
Also, thou son of man, sha2l it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters, 
That he that escapeth in that day sha2l come unto th2e, to cause th2e to hear it with thine ears? 
In that day sha2l thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 
Son of man, set thy face against the A2monites, and prophesy against them; 
And say unto the A2monites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity; 
Behold, therefore I wi2l deliver th2e to the men of the east for a po2se2sion, and they sha2l set their palaces in th2e, and make their dwe2lings in th2e: they sha2l eat thy fruit, and they sha2l drink thy milk. 
And I wi2l make Ra2bah a stable for camels, and the A2monites a couching place for flocks: and ye sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast cla2ped thine hands, and stamped with the f2et, and rejoiced in heart with a2l thy despite against the land of Israel; 
Behold, therefore I wi2l stretch out mine hand upon th2e, and wi2l deliver th2e for a spoil to the heathen; and I wi2l cut th2e o2f from the people, and I wi2l cause th2e to perish out of the countries: I wi2l destroy th2e; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto a2l the heathen; 
Therefore, behold, I wi2l open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Bethjeshimoth, B2almeon, and Kiriathaim, 
Unto the men of the east with the A2monites, and wi2l give them in po2se2sion, that the A2monites may not be remembered among the nations. 
And I wi2l execute judgments upon Moab; and they sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly o2fended, and revenged himself upon them; 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I wi2l also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and wi2l cut o2f man and beast from it; and I wi2l make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan sha2l fa2l by the sword. 
And I wi2l lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they sha2l do in Edom a2cording to mine anger and a2cording to my fury; and they sha2l know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy it for the old hatred; 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I wi2l stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I wi2l cut o2f the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast. 
And I wi2l execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they sha2l know that I am the LORD, when I sha2l lay my vengeance upon them. 
And it came to pa2s in the eleventh year, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken that was the gates of the people: she is turned unto me: I sha2l be replenished, now she is laid waste: 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against th2e, O Tyrus, and wi2l cause many nations to come up against th2e, as the sea causeth his waves to come up. 
And they sha2l destroy the wa2ls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I wi2l also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock. 
It sha2l be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD: and it sha2l become a spoil to the nations. 
And her daughters which are in the field sha2l be slain by the sword; and they sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I wi2l bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people. 
He sha2l slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he sha2l make a fort against th2e, and cast a mount against th2e, and lift up the buckler against th2e. 
And he sha2l set engines of war against thy wa2ls, and with his axes he sha2l break down thy towers. 
By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust sha2l cover th2e: thy wa2ls sha2l shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wh2els, and of the chariots, when he sha2l enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach. 
With the h2ofs of his horses sha2l he tread down a2l thy str2ets: he sha2l slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong ga2risons sha2l go down to the ground. 
And they sha2l make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they sha2l break down thy wa2ls, and destroy thy pleasant houses: and they sha2l lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water. 
And I wi2l cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps sha2l be no more heard. 
And I wi2l make th2e like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the LORD have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Sha2l not the isles shake at the sound of thy fa2l, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of th2e? 
Then a2l the princes of the sea sha2l come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put o2f their broidered garments: they sha2l clothe themselves with trembling; they sha2l sit upon the ground, and sha2l tremble at every moment, and be astonished at th2e. 
And they sha2l take up a lamentation for th2e, and say to th2e, How art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their te2ror to be on a2l that haunt it! 
Now sha2l the isles tremble in the day of thy fa2l; yea, the isles that are in the sea sha2l be troubled at thy departure. 
For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I sha2l make th2e a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I sha2l bring up the d2ep upon th2e, and great waters sha2l cover th2e; 
When I sha2l bring th2e down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and sha2l set th2e in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I sha2l set glory in the land of the living; 
I wi2l make th2e a te2ror, and thou shalt be no more: though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord GOD. 
The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 
Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus; 
And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, which art a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I am of perfect beauty. 
Thy borders are in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty. 
They have made a2l thy ship boards of fir tr2es of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for th2e. 
Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory, brought out of the isles of Chi2tim. 
Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered th2e. 
The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise men, O Tyrus, that were in th2e, were thy pilots. 
The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in th2e thy calkers: a2l the ships of the sea with their mariners were in th2e to o2cupy thy merchandise. 
They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in th2e; they set forth thy comeline2s. 
The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy wa2ls round about, and the Ga2madims were in thy towers: they hanged their shields upon thy wa2ls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect. 
Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of a2l kind of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs. 
Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants: they traded the persons of men and ve2sels of bra2s in thy market. 
They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules. 
The men of Dedan were thy merchants; many isles were the merchandise of thine hand: they brought th2e for a present horns of ivory and ebony. 
Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making: they o2cupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate. 
Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants: they traded in thy market wheat of Mi2nith, and Pa2nag, and honey, and oil, and balm. 
Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of a2l riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white w2ol. 
Dan also and Javan going to and fro o2cupied in thy fairs: bright iron, ca2sia, and calamus, were in thy market. 
Dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots. 
Arabia, and a2l the princes of Kedar, they o2cupied with th2e in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they thy merchants. 
The merchants of Sheba and R2amah, they were thy merchants: they o2cupied in thy fairs with chief of a2l spices, and with a2l precious stones, and gold. 
Haran, and Ca2neh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, A2shur, and Chilmad, were thy merchants. 
These were thy merchants in a2l sorts of things, in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich a2parel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise. 
The ships of Tarshish did sing of th2e in thy market: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas. 
Thy rowers have brought th2e into great waters: the east wind hath broken th2e in the midst of the seas. 
Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the o2cupiers of thy merchandise, and a2l thy men of war, that are in th2e, and in a2l thy company which is in the midst of th2e, sha2l fa2l into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin. 
The suburbs sha2l shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots. 
And a2l that handle the oar, the mariners, and a2l the pilots of the sea, sha2l come down from their ships, they sha2l stand upon the land; 
And sha2l cause their voice to be heard against th2e, and sha2l cry bi2terly, and sha2l cast up dust upon their heads, they sha2l wa2low themselves in the ashes: 
And they sha2l make themselves u2terly bald for th2e, and gird them with sackcloth, and they sha2l w2ep for th2e with bi2terne2s of heart and bi2ter wailing. 
And in their wailing they sha2l take up a lamentation for th2e, and lament over th2e, saying, What city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea? 
When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou fi2ledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise. 
In the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and a2l thy company in the midst of th2e sha2l fa2l. 
A2l the inhabitants of the isles sha2l be astonished at th2e, and their kings sha2l be sore afraid, they sha2l be troubled in their countenance. 
The merchants among the people sha2l hi2s at th2e; thou shalt be a te2ror, and never shalt be any more. 
The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 
Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man, and not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God: 
Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from th2e: 
With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast go2ten th2e riches, and hast go2ten gold and silver into thy treasures: 
By thy great wisdom and by thy tra2fick hast thou increased thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches: 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God; 
Behold, therefore I wi2l bring strangers upon th2e, the te2rible of the nations: and they sha2l draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they sha2l defile thy brightne2s. 
They sha2l bring th2e down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas. 
Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth th2e, I am God? but thou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth th2e. 
Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD. 
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, fu2l of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. 
Thou hast b2en in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sa2phire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in th2e in the day that thou wast created. 
Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set th2e so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. 
Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, ti2l iniquity was found in th2e. 
By the multitude of thy merchandise they have fi2led the midst of th2e with violence, and thou hast si2ned: therefore I wi2l cast th2e as profane out of the mountain of God: and I wi2l destroy th2e, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. 
Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast co2rupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightne2s: I wi2l cast th2e to the ground, I wi2l lay th2e before kings, that they may behold th2e. 
Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy tra2fick; therefore wi2l I bring forth a fire from the midst of th2e, it sha2l devour th2e, and I wi2l bring th2e to ashes upon the earth in the sight of a2l them that behold th2e. 
A2l they that know th2e among the people sha2l be astonished at th2e: thou shalt be a te2ror, and never shalt thou be any more. 
Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it, 
And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against th2e, O Zidon; and I wi2l be glorified in the midst of th2e: and they sha2l know that I am the LORD, when I sha2l have executed judgments in her, and sha2l be sanctified in her. 
For I wi2l send into her pestilence, and bl2od into her str2ets; and the wounded sha2l be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side; and they sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
And there sha2l be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorn of a2l that are round about them, that despised them; and they sha2l know that I am the Lord GOD. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I sha2l have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are sca2tered, and sha2l be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then sha2l they dwe2l in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob. 
And they sha2l dwe2l safely therein, and sha2l build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they sha2l dwe2l with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon a2l those that despise them round about them; and they sha2l know that I am the LORD their God. 
In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against a2l Egypt: 
Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against th2e, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself. 
But I wi2l put h2oks in thy jaws, and I wi2l cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I wi2l bring th2e up out of the midst of thy rivers, and a2l the fish of thy rivers sha2l stick unto thy scales. 
And I wi2l leave th2e thrown into the wilderne2s, th2e and a2l the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fa2l upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given th2e for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven. 
And a2l the inhabitants of Egypt sha2l know that I am the LORD, because they have b2en a sta2f of r2ed to the house of Israel. 
When they t2ok hold of th2e by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend a2l their shoulder: and when they leaned upon th2e, thou brakest, and madest a2l their loins to be at a stand. 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I wi2l bring a sword upon th2e, and cut o2f man and beast out of th2e. 
And the land of Egypt sha2l be desolate and waste; and they sha2l know that I am the LORD: because he hath said, The river is mine, and I have made it. 
Behold, therefore I am against th2e, and against thy rivers, and I wi2l make the land of Egypt u2terly waste and desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia. 
No f2ot of man sha2l pa2s through it, nor f2ot of beast sha2l pa2s through it, neither sha2l it be inhabited forty years. 
And I wi2l make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste sha2l be desolate forty years: and I wi2l sca2ter the Egyptians among the nations, and wi2l disperse them through the countries. 
Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years wi2l I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were sca2tered: 
And I wi2l bring again the captivity of Egypt, and wi2l cause them to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they sha2l be there a base kingdom. 
It sha2l be the basest of the kingdoms; neither sha2l it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I wi2l diminish them, that they sha2l no more rule over the nations. 
And it sha2l be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance, when they sha2l l2ok after them: but they sha2l know that I am the Lord GOD. 
And it came to pa2s in the seven and twentieth year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was p2eled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it: 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I wi2l give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon; and he sha2l take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it sha2l be the wages for his army. 
I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord GOD. 
In that day wi2l I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I wi2l give th2e the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 
Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Howl ye, Woe worth the day! 
For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a cloudy day; it sha2l be the time of the heathen. 
And the sword sha2l come upon Egypt, and great pain sha2l be in Ethiopia, when the slain sha2l fa2l in Egypt, and they sha2l take away her multitude, and her foundations sha2l be broken down. 
Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and a2l the mingled people, and Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, sha2l fa2l with them by the sword. 
Thus saith the LORD; They also that uphold Egypt sha2l fa2l; and the pride of her power sha2l come down: from the tower of Syene sha2l they fa2l in it by the sword, saith the Lord GOD. 
And they sha2l be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities sha2l be in the midst of the cities that are wasted. 
And they sha2l know that I am the LORD, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and when a2l her helpers sha2l be destroyed. 
In that day sha2l me2sengers go forth from me in ships to make the carele2s Ethiopians afraid, and great pain sha2l come upon them, as in the day of Egypt: for, lo, it cometh. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; I wi2l also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadre2zar king of Babylon. 
He and his people with him, the te2rible of the nations, sha2l be brought to destroy the land: and they sha2l draw their swords against Egypt, and fi2l the land with the slain. 
And I wi2l make the rivers dry, and se2l the land into the hand of the wicked: and I wi2l make the land waste, and a2l that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I the LORD have spoken it. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; I wi2l also destroy the idols, and I wi2l cause their images to cease out of Noph; and there sha2l be no more a prince of the land of Egypt: and I wi2l put a fear in the land of Egypt. 
And I wi2l make Pathros desolate, and wi2l set fire in Zoan, and wi2l execute judgments in No. 
And I wi2l pour my fury upon Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I wi2l cut o2f the multitude of No. 
And I wi2l set fire in Egypt: Sin sha2l have great pain, and No sha2l be rent asunder, and Noph sha2l have distre2ses daily. 
The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth sha2l fa2l by the sword: and these cities sha2l go into captivity. 
At Tehaphnehes also the day sha2l be darkened, when I sha2l break there the yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength sha2l cease in her: as for her, a cloud sha2l cover her, and her daughters sha2l go into captivity. 
Thus wi2l I execute judgments in Egypt: and they sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
And it came to pa2s in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it sha2l not be bound up to be healed, to put a ro2ler to bind it, to make it strong to hold the sword. 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and wi2l break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken; and I wi2l cause the sword to fa2l out of his hand. 
And I wi2l sca2ter the Egyptians among the nations, and wi2l disperse them through the countries. 
And I wi2l strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I wi2l break Pharaoh's arms, and he sha2l groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man. 
But I wi2l strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh sha2l fa2l down; and they sha2l know that I am the LORD, when I sha2l put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he sha2l stretch it out upon the land of Egypt. 
And I wi2l sca2ter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries; and they sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
And it came to pa2s in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatne2s? 
Behold, the A2syrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs. 
The waters made him great, the d2ep set him up on high with her rivers ru2ning round about his plants, and sent her li2tle rivers unto a2l the tr2es of the field. 
Therefore his height was exalted above a2l the tr2es of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth. 
A2l the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did a2l the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt a2l great nations. 
Thus was he fair in his greatne2s, in the length of his branches: for his r2ot was by great waters. 
The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir tr2es were not like his boughs, and the chestnut tr2es were not like his branches; nor any tr2e in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty. 
I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that a2l the tr2es of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him. 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height; 
I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he sha2l surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedne2s. 
And strangers, the te2rible of the nations, have cut him o2f, and have left him: upon the mountains and in a2l the va2leys his branches are fa2len, and his boughs are broken by a2l the rivers of the land; and a2l the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him. 
Upon his ruin sha2l a2l the fowls of the heaven remain, and a2l the beasts of the field sha2l be upon his branches: 
To the end that none of a2l the tr2es by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither sh2ot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their tr2es stand up in their height, a2l that drink water: for they are a2l delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the d2ep for him, and I restrained the fl2ods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and a2l the tr2es of the field fainted for him. 
I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fa2l, when I cast him down to he2l with them that descend into the pit: and a2l the tr2es of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, a2l that drink water, sha2l be comforted in the nether parts of the earth. 
They also went down into he2l with him unto them that be slain with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen. 
To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatne2s among the tr2es of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the tr2es of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and a2l his multitude, saith the Lord GOD. 
And it came to pa2s in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou art as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy f2et, and fouledst their rivers. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; I wi2l therefore spread out my net over th2e with a company of many people; and they sha2l bring th2e up in my net. 
Then wi2l I leave th2e upon the land, I wi2l cast th2e forth upon the open field, and wi2l cause a2l the fowls of the heaven to remain upon th2e, and I wi2l fi2l the beasts of the whole earth with th2e. 
And I wi2l lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fi2l the va2leys with thy height. 
I wi2l also water with thy bl2od the land wherein thou swi2mest, even to the mountains; and the rivers sha2l be fu2l of th2e. 
And when I sha2l put th2e out, I wi2l cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I wi2l cover the sun with a cloud, and the m2on sha2l not give her light. 
A2l the bright lights of heaven wi2l I make dark over th2e, and set darkne2s upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD. 
I wi2l also vex the hearts of many people, when I sha2l bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known. 
Yea, I wi2l make many people amazed at th2e, and their kings sha2l be ho2ribly afraid for th2e, when I sha2l brandish my sword before them; and they sha2l tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fa2l. 
For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon sha2l come upon th2e. 
By the swords of the mighty wi2l I cause thy multitude to fa2l, the te2rible of the nations, a2l of them: and they sha2l spoil the pomp of Egypt, and a2l the multitude thereof sha2l be destroyed. 
I wi2l destroy also a2l the beasts thereof from beside the great waters; neither sha2l the f2ot of man trouble them any more, nor the h2ofs of beasts trouble them. 
Then wi2l I make their waters d2ep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord GOD. 
When I sha2l make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country sha2l be destitute of that whereof it was fu2l, when I sha2l smite a2l them that dwe2l therein, then sha2l they know that I am the LORD. 
This is the lamentation wherewith they sha2l lament her: the daughters of the nations sha2l lament her: they sha2l lament for her, even for Egypt, and for a2l her multitude, saith the Lord GOD. 
It came to pa2s also in the twelfth year, in the fift2enth day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit. 
Whom dost thou pa2s in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised. 
They sha2l fa2l in the midst of them that are slain by the sword: she is delivered to the sword: draw her and a2l her multitudes. 
The strong among the mighty sha2l speak to him out of the midst of he2l with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword. 
A2shur is there and a2l her company: his graves are about him: a2l of them slain, fa2len by the sword: 
Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about her grave: a2l of them slain, fa2len by the sword, which caused te2ror in the land of the living. 
There is Elam and a2l her multitude round about her grave, a2l of them slain, fa2len by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their te2ror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit. 
They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with a2l her multitude: her graves are round about him: a2l of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their te2ror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of them that be slain. 
There is Meshech, Tubal, and a2l her multitude: her graves are round about him: a2l of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their te2ror in the land of the living. 
And they sha2l not lie with the mighty that are fa2len of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to he2l with their weapons of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities sha2l be upon their bones, though they were the te2ror of the mighty in the land of the living. 
Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword. 
There is Edom, her kings, and a2l her princes, which with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword: they sha2l lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit. 
There be the princes of the north, a2l of them, and a2l the Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their te2ror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit. 
Pharaoh sha2l s2e them, and sha2l be comforted over a2l his multitude, even Pharaoh and a2l his army slain by the sword, saith the Lord GOD. 
For I have caused my te2ror in the land of the living: and he sha2l be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword, even Pharaoh and a2l his multitude, saith the Lord GOD. 
Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman: 
If when he s2eth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people; 
Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his bl2od sha2l be upon his own head. 
He heard the sound of the trumpet, and t2ok not warning; his bl2od sha2l be upon him. But he that taketh warning sha2l deliver his soul. 
But if the watchman s2e the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his bl2od wi2l I require at the watchman's hand. 
So thou, O son of man, I have set th2e a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. 
When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man sha2l die in his iniquity; but his bl2od wi2l I require at thine hand. 
Neverthele2s, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he sha2l die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. 
Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgre2sions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live? 
Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why wi2l ye die, O house of Israel? 
Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousne2s of the righteous sha2l not deliver him in the day of his transgre2sion: as for the wickedne2s of the wicked, he sha2l not fa2l thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedne2s; neither sha2l the righteous be able to live for his righteousne2s in the day that he si2neth. 
When I sha2l say to the righteous, that he sha2l surely live; if he trust to his own righteousne2s, and co2mit iniquity, a2l his righteousne2ses sha2l not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath co2mi2ted, he sha2l die for it. 
Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right; 
If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had ro2bed, walk in the statutes of life, without co2mi2ting iniquity; he sha2l surely live, he sha2l not die. 
None of his sins that he hath co2mi2ted sha2l be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he sha2l surely live. 
Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal. 
When the righteous turneth from his righteousne2s, and co2mi2teth iniquity, he sha2l even die thereby. 
But if the wicked turn from his wickedne2s, and do that which is lawful and right, he sha2l live thereby. 
Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I wi2l judge you every one after his ways. 
And it came to pa2s in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smi2ten. 
Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb. 
Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance. 
Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the bl2od, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed bl2od: and sha2l ye po2se2s the land? 
Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife: and sha2l ye po2se2s the land? 
Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes sha2l fa2l by the sword, and him that is in the open field wi2l I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves sha2l die of the pestilence. 
For I wi2l lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength sha2l cease; and the mountains of Israel sha2l be desolate, that none sha2l pa2s through. 
Then sha2l they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the land most desolate because of a2l their abominations which they have co2mi2ted. 
Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people sti2l are talking against th2e by the wa2ls and in the d2ors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD. 
And they come unto th2e as the people cometh, and they sit before th2e as my people, and they hear thy words, but they wi2l not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousne2s. 
And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play we2l on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not. 
And when this cometh to pa2s, (lo, it wi2l come,) then sha2l they know that a prophet hath b2en among them. 
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do f2ed themselves! should not the shepherds f2ed the flocks? 
Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the w2ol, ye ki2l them that are fed: but ye f2ed not the flock. 
The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them. 
And they were sca2tered, because there is no shepherd: and they became meat to a2l the beasts of the field, when they were sca2tered. 
My sh2ep wandered through a2l the mountains, and upon every high hi2l: yea, my flock was sca2tered upon a2l the face of the earth, and none did search or s2ek after them. 
Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD; 
As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock; 
Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD; 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I wi2l require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from f2eding the flock; neither sha2l the shepherds f2ed themselves any more; for I wi2l deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them. 
For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, wi2l both search my sh2ep, and s2ek them out. 
As a shepherd s2eketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sh2ep that are sca2tered; so wi2l I s2ek out my sh2ep, and wi2l deliver them out of a2l places where they have b2en sca2tered in the cloudy and dark day. 
And I wi2l bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and wi2l bring them to their own land, and f2ed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in a2l the inhabited places of the country. 
I wi2l f2ed them in a g2od pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel sha2l their fold be: there sha2l they lie in a g2od fold, and in a fat pasture sha2l they f2ed upon the mountains of Israel. 
I wi2l f2ed my flock, and I wi2l cause them to lie down, saith the Lord GOD. 
I wi2l s2ek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and wi2l bind up that which was broken, and wi2l strengthen that which was sick: but I wi2l destroy the fat and the strong; I wi2l f2ed them with judgment. 
And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge betw2en ca2tle and ca2tle, betw2en the rams and the he goats. 
S2emeth it a sma2l thing unto you to have eaten up the g2od pasture, but ye must tread down with your f2et the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the d2ep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your f2et? 
And as for my flock, they eat that which ye have tro2den with your f2et; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your f2et. 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even I, wi2l judge betw2en the fat ca2tle and betw2en the lean ca2tle. 
Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed a2l the diseased with your horns, ti2l ye have sca2tered them abroad; 
Therefore wi2l I save my flock, and they sha2l no more be a prey; and I wi2l judge betw2en ca2tle and ca2tle. 
And I wi2l set up one shepherd over them, and he sha2l f2ed them, even my servant David; he sha2l f2ed them, and he sha2l be their shepherd. 
And I the LORD wi2l be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken it. 
And I wi2l make with them a covenant of peace, and wi2l cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they sha2l dwe2l safely in the wilderne2s, and sl2ep in the w2ods. 
And I wi2l make them and the places round about my hi2l a ble2sing; and I wi2l cause the shower to come down in his season; there sha2l be showers of ble2sing. 
And the tr2e of the field sha2l yield her fruit, and the earth sha2l yield her increase, and they sha2l be safe in their land, and sha2l know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them. 
And they sha2l no more be a prey to the heathen, neither sha2l the beast of the land devour them; but they sha2l dwe2l safely, and none sha2l make them afraid. 
And I wi2l raise up for them a plant of renown, and they sha2l be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more. 
Thus sha2l they know that I the LORD their God am with them, and that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord GOD. 
And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord GOD. 
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it, 
And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I am against th2e, and I wi2l stretch out mine hand against th2e, and I wi2l make th2e most desolate. 
I wi2l lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD. 
Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed the bl2od of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time that their iniquity had an end: 
Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I wi2l prepare th2e unto bl2od, and bl2od sha2l pursue th2e: sith thou hast not hated bl2od, even bl2od sha2l pursue th2e. 
Thus wi2l I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut o2f from it him that pa2seth out and him that returneth. 
And I wi2l fi2l his mountains with his slain men: in thy hi2ls, and in thy va2leys, and in a2l thy rivers, sha2l they fa2l that are slain with the sword. 
I wi2l make th2e perpetual desolations, and thy cities sha2l not return: and ye sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries sha2l be mine, and we wi2l po2se2s it; whereas the LORD was there: 
Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I wi2l even do a2cording to thine anger, and a2cording to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I wi2l make myself known among them, when I have judged th2e. 
And thou shalt know that I am the LORD, and that I have heard a2l thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume. 
Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard them. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I wi2l make th2e desolate. 
As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so wi2l I do unto th2e: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and a2l Idumea, even a2l of it: and they sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD: 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the enemy hath said against you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in po2se2sion: 
Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they have made you desolate, and swa2lowed you up on every side, that ye might be a po2se2sion unto the residue of the heathen, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers, and are an infamy of the people: 
Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hi2ls, to the rivers, and to the va2leys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round about; 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against a2l Idumea, which have a2pointed my land into their po2se2sion with the joy of a2l their heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a prey. 
Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto the mountains, and to the hi2ls, to the rivers, and to the va2leys, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the shame of the heathen: 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have lifted up mine hand, Surely the heathen that are about you, they sha2l bear their shame. 
But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye sha2l sh2ot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at hand to come. 
For, behold, I am for you, and I wi2l turn unto you, and ye sha2l be ti2led and sown: 
And I wi2l multiply men upon you, a2l the house of Israel, even a2l of it: and the cities sha2l be inhabited, and the wastes sha2l be builded: 
And I wi2l multiply upon you man and beast; and they sha2l increase and bring fruit: and I wi2l se2tle you after your old estates, and wi2l do be2ter unto you than at your begi2nings: and ye sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
Yea, I wi2l cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they sha2l po2se2s th2e, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, Thou land devourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations: 
Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations any more, saith the Lord GOD. 
Neither wi2l I cause men to hear in th2e the shame of the heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fa2l any more, saith the Lord GOD. 
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was before me as the unclea2ne2s of a removed woman. 
Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the bl2od that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had po2luted it: 
And I sca2tered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries: a2cording to their way and a2cording to their doings I judged them. 
And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land. 
But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went. 
Therefore say unto the house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went. 
And I wi2l sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen sha2l know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I sha2l be sanctified in you before their eyes. 
For I wi2l take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of a2l countries, and wi2l bring you into your own land. 
Then wi2l I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye sha2l be clean: from a2l your filthine2s, and from a2l your idols, wi2l I cleanse you. 
A new heart also wi2l I give you, and a new spirit wi2l I put within you: and I wi2l take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I wi2l give you an heart of flesh. 
And I wi2l put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye sha2l k2ep my judgments, and do them. 
And ye sha2l dwe2l in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye sha2l be my people, and I wi2l be your God. 
I wi2l also save you from a2l your unclea2ne2ses: and I wi2l ca2l for the corn, and wi2l increase it, and lay no famine upon you. 
And I wi2l multiply the fruit of the tr2e, and the increase of the field, that ye sha2l receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen. 
Then sha2l ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not g2od, and sha2l lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations. 
Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I sha2l have cleansed you from a2l your iniquities I wi2l also cause you to dwe2l in the cities, and the wastes sha2l be builded. 
And the desolate land sha2l be ti2led, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of a2l that pa2sed by. 
And they sha2l say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced, and are inhabited. 
Then the heathen that are left round about you sha2l know that I the LORD build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate: I the LORD have spoken it, and I wi2l do it. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; I wi2l yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I wi2l increase them with men like a flock. 
As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so sha2l the waste cities be fi2led with flocks of men: and they sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
The hand of the LORD was upon me, and ca2ried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the va2ley which was fu2l of bones, 
And caused me to pa2s by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open va2ley; and, lo, they were very dry. 
And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest. 
Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I wi2l cause breath to enter into you, and ye sha2l live: 
And I wi2l lay sinews upon you, and wi2l bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye sha2l live; and ye sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
So I prophesied as I was co2manded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone. 
And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them. 
Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live. 
So I prophesied as he co2manded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and st2od up upon their f2et, an exc2eding great army. 
Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut o2f for our parts. 
Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I wi2l open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. 
And ye sha2l know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, 
And sha2l put my spirit in you, and ye sha2l live, and I sha2l place you in your own land: then sha2l ye know that I the LORD have spoken it, and performed it, saith the LORD. 
The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 
Moreover, thou son of man, take th2e one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and for a2l the house of Israel his companions: 
And join them one to another into one stick; and they sha2l become one in thine hand. 
And when the children of thy people sha2l speak unto th2e, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these? 
Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I wi2l take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fe2lows, and wi2l put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they sha2l be one in mine hand. 
And the sticks whereon thou writest sha2l be in thine hand before their eyes. 
And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I wi2l take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and wi2l gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land: 
And I wi2l make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king sha2l be king to them a2l: and they sha2l be no more two nations, neither sha2l they be divided into two kingdoms any more at a2l. 
Neither sha2l they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgre2sions: but I wi2l save them out of a2l their dwe2lingplaces, wherein they have si2ned, and wi2l cleanse them: so sha2l they be my people, and I wi2l be their God. 
And David my servant sha2l be king over them; and they a2l sha2l have one shepherd: they sha2l also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them. 
And they sha2l dwe2l in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they sha2l dwe2l therein, even they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and my servant David sha2l be their prince for ever. 
Moreover I wi2l make a covenant of peace with them; it sha2l be an everlasting covenant with them: and I wi2l place them, and multiply them, and wi2l set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore. 
My tabernacle also sha2l be with them: yea, I wi2l be their God, and they sha2l be my people. 
And the heathen sha2l know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary sha2l be in the midst of them for evermore. 
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him, 
And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against th2e, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal: 
And I wi2l turn th2e back, and put h2oks into thy jaws, and I wi2l bring th2e forth, and a2l thine army, horses and horsemen, a2l of them clothed with a2l sorts of armour, even a great company with bucklers and shields, a2l of them handling swords: 
Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; a2l of them with shield and helmet: 
Gomer, and a2l his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and a2l his bands: and many people with th2e. 
Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and a2l thy company that are a2sembled unto th2e, and be thou a guard unto them. 
After many days thou shalt be visited: in the la2ter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have b2en always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they sha2l dwe2l safely a2l of them. 
Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and a2l thy bands, and many people with th2e. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; It sha2l also come to pa2s, that at the same time sha2l things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an evil thought: 
And thou shalt say, I wi2l go up to the land of unwa2led vi2lages; I wi2l go to them that are at rest, that dwe2l safely, a2l of them dwe2ling without wa2ls, and having neither bars nor gates, 
To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations, which have go2ten ca2tle and g2ods, that dwe2l in the midst of the land. 
Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with a2l the young lions thereof, sha2l say unto th2e, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to ca2ry away silver and gold, to take away ca2tle and g2ods, to take a great spoil? 
Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwe2leth safely, shalt thou not know it? 
And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and many people with th2e, a2l of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army: 
And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it sha2l be in the la2ter days, and I wi2l bring th2e against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I sha2l be sanctified in th2e, O Gog, before their eyes. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days many years that I would bring th2e against them? 
And it sha2l come to pa2s at the same time when Gog sha2l come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, that my fury sha2l come up in my face. 
For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there sha2l be a great shaking in the land of Israel; 
So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and a2l cr2eping things that cr2ep upon the earth, and a2l the men that are upon the face of the earth, sha2l shake at my presence, and the mountains sha2l be thrown down, and the st2ep places sha2l fa2l, and every wa2l sha2l fa2l to the ground. 
And I wi2l ca2l for a sword against him throughout a2l my mountains, saith the Lord GOD: every man's sword sha2l be against his brother. 
And I wi2l plead against him with pestilence and with bl2od; and I wi2l rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone. 
Thus wi2l I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I wi2l be known in the eyes of many nations, and they sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against th2e, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal: 
And I wi2l turn th2e back, and leave but the sixth part of th2e, and wi2l cause th2e to come up from the north parts, and wi2l bring th2e upon the mountains of Israel: 
And I wi2l smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and wi2l cause thine a2rows to fa2l out of thy right hand. 
Thou shalt fa2l upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and a2l thy bands, and the people that is with th2e: I wi2l give th2e unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured. 
Thou shalt fa2l upon the open field: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD. 
And I wi2l send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwe2l carele2sly in the isles: and they sha2l know that I am the LORD. 
So wi2l I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; and I wi2l not let them po2lute my holy name any more: and the heathen sha2l know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel. 
Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this is the day whereof I have spoken. 
And they that dwe2l in the cities of Israel sha2l go forth, and sha2l set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the a2rows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they sha2l burn them with fire seven years: 
So that they sha2l take no w2od out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they sha2l burn the weapons with fire: and they sha2l spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that ro2bed them, saith the Lord GOD. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, that I wi2l give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the va2ley of the pa2sengers on the east of the sea: and it sha2l stop the noses of the pa2sengers: and there sha2l they bury Gog and a2l his multitude: and they sha2l ca2l it The va2ley of Hamongog. 
And seven months sha2l the house of Israel be burying of them, that they may cleanse the land. 
Yea, a2l the people of the land sha2l bury them; and it sha2l be to them a renown the day that I sha2l be glorified, saith the Lord GOD. 
And they sha2l sever out men of continual employment, pa2sing through the land to bury with the pa2sengers those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months sha2l they search. 
And the pa2sengers that pa2s through the land, when any s2eth a man's bone, then sha2l he set up a sign by it, ti2l the buriers have buried it in the va2ley of Hamongog. 
And also the name of the city sha2l be Hamonah. Thus sha2l they cleanse the land. 
And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, A2semble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink bl2od. 
Ye sha2l eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the bl2od of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bu2locks, a2l of them fatlings of Bashan. 
And ye sha2l eat fat ti2l ye be fu2l, and drink bl2od ti2l ye be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you. 
Thus ye sha2l be fi2led at my table with horses and chariots, with mighty men, and with a2l men of war, saith the Lord GOD. 
And I wi2l set my glory among the heathen, and a2l the heathen sha2l s2e my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them. 
So the house of Israel sha2l know that I am the LORD their God from that day and forward. 
And the heathen sha2l know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity: because they trespa2sed against me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies: so fe2l they a2l by the sword. 
A2cording to their unclea2ne2s and a2cording to their transgre2sions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them. 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now wi2l I bring again the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and wi2l be jealous for my holy name; 
After that they have borne their shame, and a2l their trespa2ses whereby they have trespa2sed against me, when they dwelt safely in their land, and none made them afraid. 
When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many nations; 
Then sha2l they know that I am the LORD their God, which caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them any more there. 
Neither wi2l I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD. 
In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the begi2ning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourt2enth year after that the city was smi2ten, in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me thither. 
In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south. 
And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose a2pearance was like the a2pearance of bra2s, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring r2ed; and he st2od in the gate. 
And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon a2l that I sha2l shew th2e; for to the intent that I might shew them unto th2e art thou brought hither: declare a2l that thou s2est to the house of Israel. 
And behold a wa2l on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring r2ed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one r2ed; and the height, one r2ed. 
Then came he unto the gate which l2oketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one r2ed broad; and the other threshold of the gate, which was one r2ed broad. 
And every li2tle chamber was one r2ed long, and one r2ed broad; and betw2en the li2tle chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one r2ed. 
He measured also the porch of the gate within, one r2ed. 
Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward. 
And the li2tle chambers of the gate eastward were thr2e on this side, and thr2e on that side; they thr2e were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side. 
And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirt2en cubits. 
The space also before the li2tle chambers was one cubit on this side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the li2tle chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side. 
He measured then the gate from the r2of of one li2tle chamber to the r2of of another: the breadth was five and twenty cubits, d2or against d2or. 
He made also posts of thr2escore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate. 
And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the i2ner gate were fifty cubits. 
And there were na2row windows to the li2tle chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows were round about inward: and upon each post were palm tr2es. 
Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement. 
And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates was the lower pavement. 
Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the i2ner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward. 
And the gate of the outward court that l2oked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof. 
And the li2tle chambers thereof were thr2e on this side and thr2e on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. 
And their windows, and their arches, and their palm tr2es, were after the measure of the gate that l2oketh toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them. 
And the gate of the i2ner court was over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits. 
After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof a2cording to these measures. 
And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. 
And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them: and it had palm tr2es, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof. 
And there was a gate in the i2ner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits. 
And he brought me to the i2ner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate a2cording to these measures; 
And the li2tle chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, a2cording to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. 
And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad. 
And the arches thereof were toward the u2ter court; and palm tr2es were upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it had eight steps. 
And he brought me into the i2ner court toward the east: and he measured the gate a2cording to these measures. 
And the li2tle chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, were a2cording to these measures: and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. 
And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm tr2es were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps. 
And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it a2cording to these measures; 
The li2tle chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. 
And the posts thereof were toward the u2ter court; and palm tr2es were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps. 
And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt o2fering. 
And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt o2fering and the sin o2fering and the trespa2s o2fering. 
And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables. 
Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their sacrifices. 
And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt o2fering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt o2fering and the sacrifice. 
And within were h2oks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the o2fering. 
And without the i2ner gate were the chambers of the singers in the i2ner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north. 
And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the k2epers of the charge of the house. 
And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the k2epers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him. 
So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house. 
And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was thr2e cubits on this side, and thr2e cubits on that side. 
The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pi2lars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side. 
Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle. 
And the breadth of the d2or was ten cubits; and the sides of the d2or were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits. 
Then went he inward, and measured the post of the d2or, two cubits; and the d2or, six cubits; and the breadth of the d2or, seven cubits. 
So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place. 
After he measured the wa2l of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side. 
And the side chambers were thr2e, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wa2l which was of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wa2l of the house. 
And there was an enlarging, and a winding about sti2l upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went sti2l upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was sti2l upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst. 
I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers were a fu2l r2ed of six great cubits. 
The thickne2s of the wa2l, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within. 
And betw2en the chambers was the widene2s of twenty cubits round about the house on every side. 
And the d2ors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one d2or toward the north, and another d2or toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about. 
Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wa2l of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits. 
So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the wa2ls thereof, an hundred cubits long; 
Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits. 
And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it, and the ga2leries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the i2ner temple, and the porches of the court; 
The d2or posts, and the na2row windows, and the ga2leries round about on their thr2e stories, over against the d2or, cieled with w2od round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered; 
To that above the d2or, even unto the i2ner house, and without, and by a2l the wa2l round about within and without, by measure. 
And it was made with cherubims and palm tr2es, so that a palm tr2e was betw2en a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces; 
So that the face of a man was toward the palm tr2e on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tr2e on the other side: it was made through a2l the house round about. 
From the ground unto above the d2or were cherubims and palm tr2es made, and on the wa2l of the temple. 
The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the sanctuary; the a2pearance of the one as the a2pearance of the other. 
The altar of w2od was thr2e cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the wa2ls thereof, were of w2od: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the LORD. 
And the temple and the sanctuary had two d2ors. 
And the d2ors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one d2or, and two leaves for the other d2or. 
And there were made on them, on the d2ors of the temple, cherubims and palm tr2es, like as were made upon the wa2ls; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without. 
And there were na2row windows and palm tr2es on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the house, and thick planks. 
Then he brought me forth into the u2ter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the north. 
Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north d2or, and the breadth was fifty cubits. 
Over against the twenty cubits which were for the i2ner court, and over against the pavement which was for the u2ter court, was ga2lery against ga2lery in thr2e stories. 
And before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their d2ors toward the north. 
Now the u2per chambers were shorter: for the ga2leries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the mi2dlemost of the building. 
For they were in thr2e stories, but had not pi2lars as the pi2lars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest and the mi2dlemost from the ground. 
And the wa2l that was without over against the chambers, toward the u2ter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was fifty cubits. 
For the length of the chambers that were in the u2ter court was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits. 
And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the u2ter court. 
The chambers were in the thickne2s of the wa2l of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building. 
And the way before them was like the a2pearance of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: and a2l their goings out were both a2cording to their fashions, and a2cording to their d2ors. 
And a2cording to the d2ors of the chambers that were toward the south was a d2or in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wa2l toward the east, as one entereth into them. 
Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that a2proach unto the LORD sha2l eat the most holy things: there sha2l they lay the most holy things, and the meat o2fering, and the sin o2fering, and the trespa2s o2fering; for the place is holy. 
When the priests enter therein, then sha2l they not go out of the holy place into the u2ter court, but there they sha2l lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and sha2l put on other garments, and sha2l a2proach to those things which are for the people. 
Now when he had made an end of measuring the i2ner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured it round about. 
He measured the east side with the measuring r2ed, five hundred r2eds, with the measuring r2ed round about. 
He measured the north side, five hundred r2eds, with the measuring r2ed round about. 
He measured the south side, five hundred r2eds, with the measuring r2ed. 
He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred r2eds with the measuring r2ed. 
He measured it by the four sides: it had a wa2l round about, five hundred r2eds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation betw2en the sanctuary and the profane place. 
Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that l2oketh toward the east: 
And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory. 
And it was a2cording to the a2pearance of the vision which I saw, even a2cording to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fe2l upon my face. 
And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east. 
So the spirit t2ok me up, and brought me into the i2ner court; and, behold, the glory of the LORD fi2led the house. 
And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man st2od by me. 
And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my f2et, where I wi2l dwe2l in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, sha2l the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places. 
In their se2ting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wa2l betw2en me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have co2mi2ted: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger. 
Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I wi2l dwe2l in the midst of them for ever. 
Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pa2tern. 
And if they be ashamed of a2l that they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and a2l the forms thereof, and a2l the ordinances thereof, and a2l the forms thereof, and a2l the laws thereof: and write it in their sight, that they may k2ep the whole form thereof, and a2l the ordinances thereof, and do them. 
This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about sha2l be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house. 
And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bo2tom sha2l be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about sha2l be a span: and this sha2l be the higher place of the altar. 
And from the bo2tom upon the ground even to the lower se2tle sha2l be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the le2ser se2tle even to the greater se2tle sha2l be four cubits, and the breadth one cubit. 
So the altar sha2l be four cubits; and from the altar and upward sha2l be four horns. 
And the altar sha2l be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof. 
And the se2tle sha2l be fourt2en cubits long and fourt2en broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it sha2l be half a cubit; and the bo2tom thereof sha2l be a cubit about; and his stairs sha2l l2ok toward the east. 
And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they sha2l make it, to o2fer burnt o2ferings thereon, and to sprinkle bl2od thereon. 
And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the s2ed of Zadok, which a2proach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord GOD, a young bu2lock for a sin o2fering. 
And thou shalt take of the bl2od thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the se2tle, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it. 
Thou shalt take the bu2lock also of the sin o2fering, and he sha2l burn it in the a2pointed place of the house, without the sanctuary. 
And on the second day thou shalt o2fer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin o2fering; and they sha2l cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bu2lock. 
When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt o2fer a young bu2lock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish. 
And thou shalt o2fer them before the LORD, and the priests sha2l cast salt upon them, and they sha2l o2fer them up for a burnt o2fering unto the LORD. 
Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin o2fering: they sha2l also prepare a young bu2lock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish. 
Seven days sha2l they purge the altar and purify it; and they sha2l consecrate themselves. 
And when these days are expired, it sha2l be, that upon the eighth day, and so forward, the priests sha2l make your burnt o2ferings upon the altar, and your peace o2ferings; and I wi2l a2cept you, saith the Lord GOD. 
Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which l2oketh toward the east; and it was shut. 
Then said the LORD unto me; This gate sha2l be shut, it sha2l not be opened, and no man sha2l enter in by it; because the LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it sha2l be shut. 
It is for the prince; the prince, he sha2l sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he sha2l enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and sha2l go out by the way of the same. 
Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house: and I l2oked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD fi2led the house of the LORD: and I fe2l upon my face. 
And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark we2l, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears a2l that I say unto th2e concerning a2l the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and a2l the laws thereof; and mark we2l the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary. 
And thou shalt say to the rebe2lious, even to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it su2fice you of a2l your abominations, 
In that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to po2lute it, even my house, when ye o2fer my bread, the fat and the bl2od, and they have broken my covenant because of a2l your abominations. 
And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have set k2epers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, sha2l enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that is among the children of Israel. 
And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they sha2l even bear their iniquity. 
Yet they sha2l be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they sha2l slay the burnt o2fering and the sacrifice for the people, and they sha2l stand before them to minister unto them. 
Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fa2l into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they sha2l bear their iniquity. 
And they sha2l not come near unto me, to do the o2fice of a priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy place: but they sha2l bear their shame, and their abominations which they have co2mi2ted. 
But I wi2l make them k2epers of the charge of the house, for a2l the service thereof, and for a2l that sha2l be done therein. 
But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they sha2l come near to me to minister unto me, and they sha2l stand before me to o2fer unto me the fat and the bl2od, saith the Lord GOD: 
They sha2l enter into my sanctuary, and they sha2l come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they sha2l k2ep my charge. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that when they enter in at the gates of the i2ner court, they sha2l be clothed with linen garments; and no w2ol sha2l come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the i2ner court, and within. 
They sha2l have linen bo2nets upon their heads, and sha2l have linen br2eches upon their loins; they sha2l not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat. 
And when they go forth into the u2ter court, even into the u2ter court to the people, they sha2l put o2f their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they sha2l put on other garments; and they sha2l not sanctify the people with their garments. 
Neither sha2l they shave their heads, nor su2fer their locks to grow long; they sha2l only po2l their heads. 
Neither sha2l any priest drink wine, when they enter into the i2ner court. 
Neither sha2l they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they sha2l take maidens of the s2ed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before. 
And they sha2l teach my people the di2ference betw2en the holy and profane, and cause them to discern betw2en the unclean and the clean. 
And in controversy they sha2l stand in judgment; and they sha2l judge it a2cording to my judgments: and they sha2l k2ep my laws and my statutes in a2l mine a2semblies; and they sha2l ha2low my sa2baths. 
And they sha2l come at no dead person to defile themselves: but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves. 
And after he is cleansed, they sha2l reckon unto him seven days. 
And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the i2ner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he sha2l o2fer his sin o2fering, saith the Lord GOD. 
And it sha2l be unto them for an inheritance: I am their inheritance: and ye sha2l give them no po2se2sion in Israel: I am their po2se2sion. 
They sha2l eat the meat o2fering, and the sin o2fering, and the trespa2s o2fering: and every dedicated thing in Israel sha2l be theirs. 
And the first of a2l the firstfruits of a2l things, and every oblation of a2l, of every sort of your oblations, sha2l be the priest's: ye sha2l also give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the ble2sing to rest in thine house. 
The priests sha2l not eat of any thing that is dead of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast. 
Moreover, when ye sha2l divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye sha2l o2fer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy portion of the land: the length sha2l be the length of five and twenty thousand r2eds, and the breadth sha2l be ten thousand. This sha2l be holy in a2l the borders thereof round about. 
Of this there sha2l be for the sanctuary five hundred in length, with five hundred in breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof. 
And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it sha2l be the sanctuary and the most holy place. 
The holy portion of the land sha2l be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary, which sha2l come near to minister unto the LORD: and it sha2l be a place for their houses, and an holy place for the sanctuary. 
And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth sha2l also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a po2se2sion for twenty chambers. 
And ye sha2l a2point the po2se2sion of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy portion: it sha2l be for the whole house of Israel. 
And a portion sha2l be for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the po2se2sion of the city, before the oblation of the holy portion, and before the po2se2sion of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length sha2l be over against one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border. 
In the land sha2l be his po2se2sion in Israel: and my princes sha2l no more o2pre2s my people; and the rest of the land sha2l they give to the house of Israel a2cording to their tribes. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Let it su2fice you, O princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord GOD. 
Ye sha2l have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath. 
The ephah and the bath sha2l be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof sha2l be after the homer. 
And the shekel sha2l be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fift2en shekels, sha2l be your maneh. 
This is the oblation that ye sha2l o2fer; the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat, and ye sha2l give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley: 
Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, ye sha2l o2fer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is an homer of ten baths; for ten baths are an homer: 
And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat o2fering, and for a burnt o2fering, and for peace o2ferings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord GOD. 
A2l the people of the land sha2l give this oblation for the prince in Israel. 
And it sha2l be the prince's part to give burnt o2ferings, and meat o2ferings, and drink o2ferings, in the feasts, and in the new m2ons, and in the sa2baths, in a2l solemnities of the house of Israel: he sha2l prepare the sin o2fering, and the meat o2fering, and the burnt o2fering, and the peace o2ferings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the first month, in the first day of the month, thou shalt take a young bu2lock without blemish, and cleanse the sanctuary: 
And the priest sha2l take of the bl2od of the sin o2fering, and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the se2tle of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the i2ner court. 
And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one that e2reth, and for him that is simple: so sha2l ye reconcile the house. 
In the first month, in the fourt2enth day of the month, ye sha2l have the pa2sover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread sha2l be eaten. 
And upon that day sha2l the prince prepare for himself and for a2l the people of the land a bu2lock for a sin o2fering. 
And seven days of the feast he sha2l prepare a burnt o2fering to the LORD, seven bu2locks and seven rams without blemish daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin o2fering. 
And he sha2l prepare a meat o2fering of an ephah for a bu2lock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an ephah. 
In the seventh month, in the fift2enth day of the month, sha2l he do the like in the feast of the seven days, a2cording to the sin o2fering, a2cording to the burnt o2fering, and a2cording to the meat o2fering, and a2cording to the oil. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the i2ner court that l2oketh toward the east sha2l be shut the six working days; but on the sa2bath it sha2l be opened, and in the day of the new m2on it sha2l be opened. 
And the prince sha2l enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and sha2l stand by the post of the gate, and the priests sha2l prepare his burnt o2fering and his peace o2ferings, and he sha2l worship at the threshold of the gate: then he sha2l go forth; but the gate sha2l not be shut until the evening. 
Likewise the people of the land sha2l worship at the d2or of this gate before the LORD in the sa2baths and in the new m2ons. 
And the burnt o2fering that the prince sha2l o2fer unto the LORD in the sa2bath day sha2l be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish. 
And the meat o2fering sha2l be an ephah for a ram, and the meat o2fering for the lambs as he sha2l be able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah. 
And in the day of the new m2on it sha2l be a young bu2lock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they sha2l be without blemish. 
And he sha2l prepare a meat o2fering, an ephah for a bu2lock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs a2cording as his hand sha2l a2tain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah. 
And when the prince sha2l enter, he sha2l go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he sha2l go forth by the way thereof. 
But when the people of the land sha2l come before the LORD in the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship sha2l go out by the way of the south gate; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate sha2l go forth by the way of the north gate: he sha2l not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in, but sha2l go forth over against it. 
And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, sha2l go in; and when they go forth, sha2l go forth. 
And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat o2fering sha2l be an ephah to a bu2lock, and an ephah to a ram, and to the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an ephah. 
Now when the prince sha2l prepare a voluntary burnt o2fering or peace o2ferings voluntarily unto the LORD, one sha2l then open him the gate that l2oketh toward the east, and he sha2l prepare his burnt o2fering and his peace o2ferings, as he did on the sa2bath day: then he sha2l go forth; and after his going forth one sha2l shut the gate. 
Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt o2fering unto the LORD of a lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it every morning. 
And thou shalt prepare a meat o2fering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat o2fering continua2ly by a perpetual ordinance unto the LORD. 
Thus sha2l they prepare the lamb, and the meat o2fering, and the oil, every morning for a continual burnt o2fering. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof sha2l be his sons'; it sha2l be their po2se2sion by inheritance. 
But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, then it sha2l be his to the year of liberty; after it sha2l return to the prince: but his inheritance sha2l be his sons' for them. 
Moreover the prince sha2l not take of the people's inheritance by o2pre2sion, to thrust them out of their po2se2sion; but he sha2l give his sons inheritance out of his own po2se2sion: that my people be not sca2tered every man from his po2se2sion. 
After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which l2oked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward. 
Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests sha2l boil the trespa2s o2fering and the sin o2fering, where they sha2l bake the meat o2fering; that they bear them not out into the u2ter court, to sanctify the people. 
Then he brought me forth into the u2ter court, and caused me to pa2s by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court. 
In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure. 
And there was a row of building round about in them, round about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about. 
Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house sha2l boil the sacrifice of the people. 
Afterward he brought me again unto the d2or of the house; and, behold, waters i2sued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house st2od toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar. 
Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and led me about the way without unto the u2ter gate by the way that l2oketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side. 
And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were to the ankles. 
Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the waters; the waters were to the kn2es. Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the loins. 
Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pa2s over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be pa2sed over. 
And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou s2en this? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river. 
Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were very many tr2es on the one side and on the other. 
Then said he unto me, These waters i2sue out toward the east country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the waters sha2l be healed. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that every thing that liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the rivers sha2l come, sha2l live: and there sha2l be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters sha2l come thither: for they sha2l be healed; and every thing sha2l live whither the river cometh. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that the fishers sha2l stand upon it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they sha2l be a place to spread forth nets; their fish sha2l be a2cording to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exc2eding many. 
But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof sha2l not be healed; they sha2l be given to salt. 
And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, sha2l grow a2l tr2es for meat, whose leaf sha2l not fade, neither sha2l the fruit thereof be consumed: it sha2l bring forth new fruit a2cording to his months, because their waters they i2sued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof sha2l be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine. 
Thus saith the Lord GOD; This sha2l be the border, whereby ye sha2l inherit the land a2cording to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph sha2l have two portions. 
And ye sha2l inherit it, one as we2l as another: concerning the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers: and this land sha2l fa2l unto you for inheritance. 
And this sha2l be the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad; 
Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is betw2en the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazarha2ticon, which is by the coast of Hauran. 
And the border from the sea sha2l be Hazarenan, the border of Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath. And this is the north side. 
And the east side ye sha2l measure from Hauran, and from Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by Jordan, from the border unto the east sea. And this is the east side. 
And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of strife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the south side southward. 
The west side also sha2l be the great sea from the border, ti2l a man come over against Hamath. This is the west side. 
So sha2l ye divide this land unto you a2cording to the tribes of Israel. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that ye sha2l divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which sha2l beget children among you: and they sha2l be unto you as born in the country among the children of Israel; they sha2l have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that in what tribe the stranger sojourneth, there sha2l ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord GOD. 
Now these are the names of the tribes. From the north end to the coast of the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to Hamath, Hazarenan, the border of Damascus northward, to the coast of Hamath; for these are his sides east and west; a portion for Dan. 
And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Asher. 
And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the west side, a portion for Naphtali. 
And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Mana2seh. 
And by the border of Mana2seh, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Ephraim. 
And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the west side, a portion for Reuben. 
And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west side, a portion for Judah. 
And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west side, sha2l be the o2fering which ye sha2l o2fer of five and twenty thousand r2eds in breadth, and in length as one of the other parts, from the east side unto the west side: and the sanctuary sha2l be in the midst of it. 
The oblation that ye sha2l o2fer unto the LORD sha2l be of five and twenty thousand in length, and of ten thousand in breadth. 
And for them, even for the priests, sha2l be this holy oblation; toward the north five and twenty thousand in length, and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the LORD sha2l be in the midst thereof. 
It sha2l be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok; which have kept my charge, which went not astray when the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray. 
And this oblation of the land that is o2fered sha2l be unto them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites. 
And over against the border of the priests the Levites sha2l have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth: a2l the length sha2l be five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand. 
And they sha2l not se2l of it, neither exchange, nor alienate the firstfruits of the land: for it is holy unto the LORD. 
And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand, sha2l be a profane place for the city, for dwe2ling, and for suburbs: and the city sha2l be in the midst thereof. 
And these sha2l be the measures thereof; the north side four thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred. 
And the suburbs of the city sha2l be toward the north two hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty, and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west two hundred and fifty. 
And the residue in length over against the oblation of the holy portion sha2l be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward: and it sha2l be over against the oblation of the holy portion; and the increase thereof sha2l be for f2od unto them that serve the city. 
And they that serve the city sha2l serve it out of a2l the tribes of Israel. 
A2l the oblation sha2l be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand: ye sha2l o2fer the holy oblation foursquare, with the po2se2sion of the city. 
And the residue sha2l be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation, and of the po2se2sion of the city, over against the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the east border, and westward over against the five and twenty thousand toward the west border, over against the portions for the prince: and it sha2l be the holy oblation; and the sanctuary of the house sha2l be in the midst thereof. 
Moreover from the po2se2sion of the Levites, and from the po2se2sion of the city, being in the midst of that which is the prince's, betw2en the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, sha2l be for the prince. 
As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side unto the west side, Benjamin sha2l have a portion. 
And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the west side, Simeon sha2l have a portion. 
And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west side, I2sachar a portion. 
And by the border of I2sachar, from the east side unto the west side, Zebulun a portion. 
And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west side, Gad a portion. 
And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border sha2l be even from Tamar unto the waters of strife in Kadesh, and to the river toward the great sea. 
This is the land which ye sha2l divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their portions, saith the Lord GOD. 
And these are the goings out of the city on the north side, four thousand and five hundred measures. 
And the gates of the city sha2l be after the names of the tribes of Israel: thr2e gates northward; one gate of Reuben, one gate of Judah, one gate of Levi. 
And at the east side four thousand and five hundred: and thr2e gates; and one gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, one gate of Dan. 
And at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures: and thr2e gates; one gate of Simeon, one gate of I2sachar, one gate of Zebulun. 
At the west side four thousand and five hundred, with their thr2e gates; one gate of Gad, one gate of Asher, one gate of Naphtali. 
It was round about eight2en thousand measures: and the name of the city from that day sha2l be, The LORD is there. 
In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadne2zar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. 
And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the ve2sels of the house of God: which he ca2ried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the ve2sels into the treasure house of his god. 
And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's s2ed, and of the princes; 
Children in whom was no blemish, but we2l favoured, and skilful in a2l wisdom, and cu2ning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans. 
And the king a2pointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them thr2e years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king. 
Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: 
Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Beltesha2zar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego. 
But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. 
Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs. 
And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath a2pointed your meat and your drink: for why should he s2e your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then sha2l ye make me endanger my head to the king. 
Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, 
Prove thy servants, I bes2ech th2e, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. 
Then let our countenances be l2oked upon before th2e, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou s2est, deal with thy servants. 
So he consented to them in this ma2ter, and proved them ten days. 
And at the end of ten days their countenances a2peared fairer and fa2ter in flesh than a2l the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat. 
Thus Melzar t2ok away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse. 
As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and ski2l in a2l learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in a2l visions and dreams. 
Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadne2zar. 
And the king co2muned with them; and among them a2l was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore st2od they before the king. 
And in a2l ma2ters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times be2ter than a2l the magicians and astrologers that were in a2l his realm. 
And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus. 
And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadne2zar Nebuchadne2zar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sl2ep brake from him. 
Then the king co2manded to ca2l the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and st2od before the king. 
And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. 
Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: te2l thy servants the dream, and we wi2l shew the interpretation. 
The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye wi2l not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye sha2l be cut in pieces, and your houses sha2l be made a dunghi2l. 
But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye sha2l receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof. 
They answered again and said, Let the king te2l his servants the dream, and we wi2l shew the interpretation of it. 
The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye s2e the thing is gone from me. 
But if ye wi2l not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decr2e for you: for ye have prepared lying and co2rupt words to speak before me, ti2l the time be changed: therefore te2l me the dream, and I sha2l know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof. 
The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's ma2ter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. 
And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwe2ling is not with flesh. 
For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and co2manded to destroy a2l the wise men of Babylon. 
And the decr2e went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fe2lows to be slain. 
Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon: 
He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decr2e so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. 
Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation. 
Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: 
That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fe2lows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. 
Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel ble2sed the God of heaven. 
Daniel answered and said, Ble2sed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his: 
And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and se2teth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding: 
He revealeth the d2ep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkne2s, and the light dwe2leth with him. 
I thank th2e, and praise th2e, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of th2e: for thou hast now made known unto us the king's ma2ter. 
Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I wi2l shew unto the king the interpretation. 
Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that wi2l make known unto the king the interpretation. 
The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Beltesha2zar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have s2en, and the interpretation thereof? 
Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded ca2not the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the s2othsayers, shew unto the king; 
But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadne2zar what sha2l be in the la2ter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these; 
As for th2e, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pa2s hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to th2e what sha2l come to pa2s. 
But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that sha2l make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart. 
Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightne2s was exce2lent, st2od before th2e; and the form thereof was te2rible. 
This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his be2ly and his thighs of bra2s, 
His legs of iron, his f2et part of iron and part of clay. 
Thou sawest ti2l that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his f2et that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces. 
Then was the iron, the clay, the bra2s, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the cha2f of the su2mer threshingfl2ors; and the wind ca2ried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and fi2led the whole earth. 
This is the dream; and we wi2l te2l the interpretation thereof before the king. 
Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given th2e a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory. 
And wheresoever the children of men dwe2l, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made th2e ruler over them a2l. Thou art this head of gold. 
And after th2e sha2l arise another kingdom inferior to th2e, and another third kingdom of bra2s, which sha2l bear rule over a2l the earth. 
And the fourth kingdom sha2l be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth a2l things: and as iron that breaketh a2l these, sha2l it break in pieces and bruise. 
And whereas thou sawest the f2et and toes, part of po2ters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom sha2l be divided; but there sha2l be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay. 
And as the toes of the f2et were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom sha2l be partly strong, and partly broken. 
And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they sha2l mingle themselves with the s2ed of men: but they sha2l not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay. 
And in the days of these kings sha2l the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which sha2l never be destroyed: and the kingdom sha2l not be left to other people, but it sha2l break in pieces and consume a2l these kingdoms, and it sha2l stand for ever. 
Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the bra2s, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what sha2l come to pa2s hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure. 
Then the king Nebuchadne2zar fe2l upon his face, and worshi2ped Daniel, and co2manded that they should o2fer an oblation and sw2et odours unto him. 
The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, s2eing thou couldest reveal this secret. 
Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over a2l the wise men of Babylon. 
Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the a2fairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king. 
Nebuchadne2zar the king made an image of gold, whose height was thr2escore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. 
Then Nebuchadne2zar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counse2lors, the sheri2fs, and a2l the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadne2zar the king had set up. 
Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counse2lors, the sheri2fs, and a2l the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadne2zar the king had set up; and they st2od before the image that Nebuchadne2zar had set up. 
Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is co2manded, O people, nations, and languages, 
That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and a2l kinds of musick, ye fa2l down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadne2zar the king hath set up: 
And whoso fa2leth not down and worshi2peth sha2l the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. 
Therefore at that time, when a2l the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and a2l kinds of musick, a2l the people, the nations, and the languages, fe2l down and worshi2ped the golden image that Nebuchadne2zar the king had set up. 
Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and a2cused the Jews. 
They spake and said to the king Nebuchadne2zar, O king, live for ever. 
Thou, O king, hast made a decr2e, that every man that sha2l hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and a2l kinds of musick, sha2l fa2l down and worship the golden image: 
And whoso fa2leth not down and worshi2peth, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. 
There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the a2fairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded th2e: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. 
Then Nebuchadne2zar in his rage and fury co2manded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king. 
Nebuchadne2zar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up? 
Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and a2l kinds of musick, ye fa2l down and worship the image which I have made; we2l: but if ye worship not, ye sha2l be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that sha2l deliver you out of my hands? 
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadne2zar, we are not careful to answer th2e in this ma2ter. 
If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he wi2l deliver us out of thine hand, O king. 
But if not, be it known unto th2e, O king, that we wi2l not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. 
Then was Nebuchadne2zar fu2l of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spake, and co2manded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated. 
And he co2manded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. 
Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. 
Therefore because the king's co2mandment was urgent, and the furnace exc2eding hot, the flames of the fire slew those men that t2ok up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. 
And these thr2e men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fe2l down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. 
Then Nebuchadne2zar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counse2lors, Did not we cast thr2e men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king. 
He answered and said, Lo, I s2e four men l2ose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God. 
Then Nebuchadne2zar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire. 
And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counse2lors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the sme2l of fire had pa2sed on them. 
Then Nebuchadne2zar spake, and said, Ble2sed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God. 
Therefore I make a decr2e, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing ami2s against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, sha2l be cut in pieces, and their houses sha2l be made a dunghi2l: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort. 
Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon. 
Nebuchadne2zar the king, unto a2l people, nations, and languages, that dwe2l in a2l the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. 
I thought it g2od to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me. 
How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation. 
I Nebuchadne2zar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace: 
I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me. 
Therefore made I a decr2e to bring in a2l the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream. 
Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the s2othsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof. 
But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Beltesha2zar, a2cording to the name of my God, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying, 
O Beltesha2zar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in th2e, and no secret troubleth th2e, te2l me the visions of my dream that I have s2en, and the interpretation thereof. 
Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tr2e in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great. 
The tr2e grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of a2l the earth: 
The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for a2l: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and a2l flesh was fed of it. 
I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven; 
He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tr2e, and cut o2f his branches, shake o2f his leaves, and sca2ter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches: 
Neverthele2s leave the stump of his r2ots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bra2s, in the tender gra2s of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the gra2s of the earth: 
Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pa2s over him. 
This ma2ter is by the decr2e of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he wi2l, and se2teth up over it the basest of men. 
This dream I king Nebuchadne2zar have s2en. Now thou, O Beltesha2zar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as a2l the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in th2e. 
Then Daniel, whose name was Beltesha2zar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Beltesha2zar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble th2e. Beltesha2zar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate th2e, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies. 
The tr2e that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to a2l the earth; 
Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for a2l; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation: 
It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatne2s is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth. 
And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tr2e down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the r2ots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and bra2s, in the tender gra2s of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, ti2l seven times pa2s over him; 
This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decr2e of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king: 
That they sha2l drive th2e from men, and thy dwe2ling sha2l be with the beasts of the field, and they sha2l make th2e to eat gra2s as oxen, and they sha2l wet th2e with the dew of heaven, and seven times sha2l pa2s over th2e, ti2l thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he wi2l. 
And whereas they co2manded to leave the stump of the tr2e r2ots; thy kingdom sha2l be sure unto th2e, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule. 
Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be a2ceptable unto th2e, and break o2f thy sins by righteousne2s, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the p2or; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranqui2lity. 
A2l this came upon the king Nebuchadne2zar. 
At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon. 
The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty? 
While the word was in the king's mouth, there fe2l a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadne2zar, to th2e it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from th2e. 
And they sha2l drive th2e from men, and thy dwe2ling sha2l be with the beasts of the field: they sha2l make th2e to eat gra2s as oxen, and seven times sha2l pa2s over th2e, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he wi2l. 
The same hour was the thing fulfi2led upon Nebuchadne2zar: and he was driven from men, and did eat gra2s as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, ti2l his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws. 
And at the end of the days I Nebuchadne2zar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I ble2sed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation: 
And a2l the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth a2cording to his wi2l in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou? 
At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightne2s returned unto me; and my counse2lors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and exce2lent majesty was a2ded unto me. 
Now I Nebuchadne2zar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, a2l whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase. 
Belsha2zar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand. 
Belsha2zar, whiles he tasted the wine, co2manded to bring the golden and silver ve2sels which his father Nebuchadne2zar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein. 
Then they brought the golden ve2sels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them. 
They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of bra2s, of iron, of w2od, and of stone. 
In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wa2l of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote. 
Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were l2osed, and his kn2es smote one against another. 
The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the s2othsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever sha2l read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, sha2l be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and sha2l be the third ruler in the kingdom. 
Then came in a2l the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof. 
Then was king Belsha2zar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied. 
Now the qu2en by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: and the qu2en spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble th2e, nor let thy countenance be changed: 
There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadne2zar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and s2othsayers; 
Forasmuch as an exce2lent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and di2solving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Beltesha2zar: now let Daniel be ca2led, and he wi2l shew the interpretation. 
Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry? 
I have even heard of th2e, that the spirit of the gods is in th2e, and that light and understanding and exce2lent wisdom is found in th2e. 
And now the wise men, the astrologers, have b2en brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing: 
And I have heard of th2e, that thou canst make interpretations, and di2solve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom. 
Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I wi2l read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation. 
O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadne2zar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour: 
And for the majesty that he gave him, a2l people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down. 
But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they t2ok his glory from him: 
And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwe2ling was with the wild a2ses: they fed him with gra2s like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; ti2l he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he a2pointeth over it whomsoever he wi2l. 
And thou his son, O Belsha2zar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest a2l this; 
But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the ve2sels of his house before th2e, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of bra2s, iron, w2od, and stone, which s2e not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are a2l thy ways, hast thou not glorified: 
Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was wri2ten. 
And this is the writing that was wri2ten, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. 
This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it. 
TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. 
PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians. 
Then co2manded Belsha2zar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom. 
In that night was Belsha2zar the king of the Chaldeans slain. 
And Darius the Median t2ok the kingdom, being about thr2escore and two years old. 
It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom; 
And over these thr2e presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give a2counts unto them, and the king should have no damage. 
Then this Daniel was prefe2red above the presidents and princes, because an exce2lent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm. 
Then the presidents and princes sought to find o2casion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none o2casion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any e2ror or fault found in him. 
Then said these men, We sha2l not find any o2casion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God. 
Then these presidents and princes a2sembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever. 
A2l the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counse2lors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decr2e, that whosoever sha2l ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of th2e, O king, he sha2l be cast into the den of lions. 
Now, O king, establish the decr2e, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, a2cording to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. 
Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decr2e. 
Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kn2eled upon his kn2es thr2e times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime. 
Then these men a2sembled, and found Daniel praying and making su2plication before his God. 
Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's decr2e; Hast thou not signed a decr2e, that every man that sha2l ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of th2e, O king, sha2l be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, a2cording to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. 
Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth not th2e, O king, nor the decr2e that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition thr2e times a day. 
Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured ti2l the going down of the sun to deliver him. 
Then these men a2sembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decr2e nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed. 
Then the king co2manded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continua2ly, he wi2l deliver th2e. 
And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel. 
Then the king went to his palace, and pa2sed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sl2ep went from him. 
Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions. 
And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continua2ly, able to deliver th2e from the lions? 
Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever. 
My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him i2nocency was found in me; and also before th2e, O king, have I done no hurt. 
Then was the king exc2edingly glad for him, and co2manded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no ma2ner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God. 
And the king co2manded, and they brought those men which had a2cused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake a2l their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bo2tom of the den. 
Then king Darius wrote unto a2l people, nations, and languages, that dwe2l in a2l the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. 
I make a decr2e, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which sha2l not be destroyed, and his dominion sha2l be even unto the end. 
He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions. 
So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian. 
In the first year of Belsha2zar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the ma2ters. 
Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. 
And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another. 
The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld ti2l the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the f2et as a man, and a man's heart was given to it. 
And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had thr2e ribs in the mouth of it betw2en the t2eth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh. 
After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it. 
After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and te2rible, and strong exc2edingly; and it had great iron t2eth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the f2et of it: and it was diverse from a2l the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns. 
I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another li2tle horn, before whom there were thr2e of the first horns plucked up by the r2ots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things. 
I beheld ti2l the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure w2ol: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wh2els as burning fire. 
A fiery stream i2sued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand st2od before him: the judgment was set, and the b2oks were opened. 
I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld even ti2l the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame. 
As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time. 
I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. 
And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that a2l people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which sha2l not pa2s away, and his kingdom that which sha2l not be destroyed. 
I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me. 
I came near unto one of them that st2od by, and asked him the truth of a2l this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things. 
These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which sha2l arise out of the earth. 
But the saints of the most High sha2l take the kingdom, and po2se2s the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever. 
Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from a2l the others, exc2eding dreadful, whose t2eth were of iron, and his nails of bra2s; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his f2et; 
And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom thr2e fe2l; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose l2ok was more stout than his fe2lows. 
I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; 
Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints po2se2sed the kingdom. 
Thus he said, The fourth beast sha2l be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which sha2l be diverse from a2l kingdoms, and sha2l devour the whole earth, and sha2l tread it down, and break it in pieces. 
And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that sha2l arise: and another sha2l rise after them; and he sha2l be diverse from the first, and he sha2l subdue thr2e kings. 
And he sha2l speak great words against the most High, and sha2l wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they sha2l be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time. 
But the judgment sha2l sit, and they sha2l take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. 
And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatne2s of the kingdom under the whole heaven, sha2l be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and a2l dominions sha2l serve and obey him. 
Hitherto is the end of the ma2ter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the ma2ter in my heart. 
In the third year of the reign of king Belsha2zar a vision a2peared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which a2peared unto me at the first. 
And I saw in a vision; and it came to pa2s, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai. 
Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there st2od before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last. 
I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did a2cording to his wi2l, and became great. 
And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn betw2en his eyes. 
And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had s2en standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power. 
And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. 
Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven. 
And out of one of them came forth a li2tle horn, which waxed exc2eding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land. 
And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. 
Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of the sanctuary was cast down. 
And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgre2sion, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered. 
Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake, How long sha2l be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgre2sion of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be tro2den under f2ot? 
And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and thr2e hundred days; then sha2l the sanctuary be cleansed. 
And it came to pa2s, when I, even I Daniel, had s2en the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there st2od before me as the a2pearance of a man. 
And I heard a man's voice betw2en the banks of Ulai, which ca2led, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision. 
So he came near where I st2od: and when he came, I was afraid, and fe2l upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end sha2l be the vision. 
Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a d2ep sl2ep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright. 
And he said, Behold, I wi2l make th2e know what sha2l be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time a2pointed the end sha2l be. 
The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia. 
And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is betw2en his eyes is the first king. 
Now that being broken, whereas four st2od up for it, four kingdoms sha2l stand up out of the nation, but not in his power. 
And in the la2ter time of their kingdom, when the transgre2sors are come to the fu2l, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, sha2l stand up. 
And his power sha2l be mighty, but not by his own power: and he sha2l destroy wonderfu2ly, and sha2l prosper, and practise, and sha2l destroy the mighty and the holy people. 
And through his policy also he sha2l cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he sha2l magnify himself in his heart, and by peace sha2l destroy many: he sha2l also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he sha2l be broken without hand. 
And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it sha2l be for many days. 
And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's busine2s; and I was astonished at the vision, but none underst2od it. 
In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the s2ed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans; 
In the first year of his reign I Daniel underst2od by b2oks the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would a2complish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem. 
And I set my face unto the Lord God, to s2ek by prayer and su2plications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes: 
And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confe2sion, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, k2eping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that k2ep his co2mandments; 
We have si2ned, and have co2mi2ted iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebe2led, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments: 
Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to a2l the people of the land. 
O LORD, righteousne2s belongeth unto th2e, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto a2l Israel, that are near, and that are far o2f, through a2l the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespa2s that they have trespa2sed against th2e. 
O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have si2ned against th2e. 
To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivene2ses, though we have rebe2led against him; 
Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the prophets. 
Yea, a2l Israel have transgre2sed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is wri2ten in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have si2ned against him. 
And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not b2en done as hath b2en done upon Jerusalem. 
As it is wri2ten in the law of Moses, a2l this evil is come upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy truth. 
Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in a2l his works which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice. 
And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast go2ten th2e renown, as at this day; we have si2ned, we have done wickedly. 
O LORD, a2cording to a2l thy righteousne2s, I bes2ech th2e, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to a2l that are about us. 
Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his su2plications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake. 
O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is ca2led by thy name: for we do not present our su2plications before th2e for our righteousne2ses, but for thy great mercies. 
O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are ca2led by thy name. 
And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confe2sing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my su2plication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God; 
Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had s2en in the vision at the begi2ning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation. 
And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give th2e ski2l and understanding. 
At the begi2ning of thy su2plications the co2mandment came forth, and I am come to shew th2e; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the ma2ter, and consider the vision. 
Seventy w2eks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgre2sion, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousne2s, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy. 
Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the co2mandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Me2siah the Prince sha2l be seven w2eks, and thr2escore and two w2eks: the str2et sha2l be built again, and the wa2l, even in troublous times. 
And after thr2escore and two w2eks sha2l Me2siah be cut o2f, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that sha2l come sha2l destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof sha2l be with a fl2od, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined. 
And he sha2l confirm the covenant with many for one w2ek: and in the midst of the w2ek he sha2l cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he sha2l make it desolate, even until the consu2mation, and that determined sha2l be poured upon the desolate. 
In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was ca2led Beltesha2zar; and the thing was true, but the time a2pointed was long: and he underst2od the thing, and had understanding of the vision. 
In those days I Daniel was mourning thr2e fu2l w2eks. 
I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at a2l, ti2l thr2e whole w2eks were fulfi2led. 
And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hi2dekel; 
Then I lifted up mine eyes, and l2oked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz: 
His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the a2pearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his f2et like in colour to polished bra2s, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude. 
And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fe2l upon them, so that they fled to hide themselves. 
Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeline2s was turned in me into co2ruption, and I retained no strength. 
Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a d2ep sl2ep on my face, and my face toward the ground. 
And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my kn2es and upon the palms of my hands. 
And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto th2e, and stand upright: for unto th2e am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I st2od trembling. 
Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words. 
But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withst2od me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia. 
Now I am come to make th2e understand what sha2l befa2l thy people in the la2ter days: for yet the vision is for many days. 
And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb. 
And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that st2od before me, O my lord, by the vision my so2rows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength. 
For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me. 
Then there came again and touched me one like the a2pearance of a man, and he strengthened me, 
And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto th2e, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me. 
Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto th2e? and now wi2l I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia sha2l come. 
But I wi2l shew th2e that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince. 
Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, st2od to confirm and to strengthen him. 
And now wi2l I shew th2e the truth. Behold, there sha2l stand up yet thr2e kings in Persia; and the fourth sha2l be far richer than they a2l: and by his strength through his riches he sha2l stir up a2l against the realm of Grecia. 
And a mighty king sha2l stand up, that sha2l rule with great dominion, and do a2cording to his wi2l. 
And when he sha2l stand up, his kingdom sha2l be broken, and sha2l be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor a2cording to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom sha2l be plucked up, even for others beside those. 
And the king of the south sha2l be strong, and one of his princes; and he sha2l be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion sha2l be a great dominion. 
And in the end of years they sha2l join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south sha2l come to the king of the north to make an agr2ement: but she sha2l not retain the power of the arm; neither sha2l he stand, nor his arm: but she sha2l be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times. 
But out of a branch of her r2ots sha2l one stand up in his estate, which sha2l come with an army, and sha2l enter into the fortre2s of the king of the north, and sha2l deal against them, and sha2l prevail: 
And sha2l also ca2ry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious ve2sels of silver and of gold; and he sha2l continue more years than the king of the north. 
So the king of the south sha2l come into his kingdom, and sha2l return into his own land. 
But his sons sha2l be sti2red up, and sha2l a2semble a multitude of great forces: and one sha2l certainly come, and overflow, and pa2s through: then sha2l he return, and be sti2red up, even to his fortre2s. 
And the king of the south sha2l be moved with choler, and sha2l come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he sha2l set forth a great multitude; but the multitude sha2l be given into his hand. 
And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart sha2l be lifted up; and he sha2l cast down many ten thousands: but he sha2l not be strengthened by it. 
For the king of the north sha2l return, and sha2l set forth a multitude greater than the former, and sha2l certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches. 
And in those times there sha2l many stand up against the king of the south: also the ro2bers of thy people sha2l exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they sha2l fa2l. 
So the king of the north sha2l come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south sha2l not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither sha2l there be any strength to withstand. 
But he that cometh against him sha2l do a2cording to his own wi2l, and none sha2l stand before him: and he sha2l stand in the glorious land, which by his hand sha2l be consumed. 
He sha2l also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus sha2l he do: and he sha2l give him the daughter of women, co2rupting her: but she sha2l not stand on his side, neither be for him. 
After this sha2l he turn his face unto the isles, and sha2l take many: but a prince for his own behalf sha2l cause the reproach o2fered by him to cease; without his own reproach he sha2l cause it to turn upon him. 
Then he sha2l turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he sha2l stumble and fa2l, and not be found. 
Then sha2l stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he sha2l be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in ba2tle. 
And in his estate sha2l stand up a vile person, to whom they sha2l not give the honour of the kingdom: but he sha2l come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by fla2teries. 
And with the arms of a fl2od sha2l they be overflown from before him, and sha2l be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant. 
And after the league made with him he sha2l work deceitfu2ly: for he sha2l come up, and sha2l become strong with a sma2l people. 
He sha2l enter peaceably even upon the fa2test places of the province; and he sha2l do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he sha2l sca2ter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he sha2l forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time. 
And he sha2l stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south sha2l be sti2red up to ba2tle with a very great and mighty army; but he sha2l not stand: for they sha2l forecast devices against him. 
Yea, they that f2ed of the portion of his meat sha2l destroy him, and his army sha2l overflow: and many sha2l fa2l down slain. 
And both of these kings' hearts sha2l be to do mischief, and they sha2l speak lies at one table; but it sha2l not prosper: for yet the end sha2l be at the time a2pointed. 
Then sha2l he return into his land with great riches; and his heart sha2l be against the holy covenant; and he sha2l do exploits, and return to his own land. 
At the time a2pointed he sha2l return, and come toward the south; but it sha2l not be as the former, or as the la2ter. 
For the ships of Chi2tim sha2l come against him: therefore he sha2l be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so sha2l he do; he sha2l even return, and have inte2ligence with them that forsake the holy covenant. 
And arms sha2l stand on his part, and they sha2l po2lute the sanctuary of strength, and sha2l take away the daily sacrifice, and they sha2l place the abomination that maketh desolate. 
And such as do wickedly against the covenant sha2l he co2rupt by fla2teries: but the people that do know their God sha2l be strong, and do exploits. 
And they that understand among the people sha2l instruct many: yet they sha2l fa2l by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days. 
Now when they sha2l fa2l, they sha2l be holpen with a li2tle help: but many sha2l cleave to them with fla2teries. 
And some of them of understanding sha2l fa2l, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time a2pointed. 
And the king sha2l do a2cording to his wi2l; and he sha2l exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and sha2l speak marve2lous things against the God of gods, and sha2l prosper ti2l the indignation be a2complished: for that that is determined sha2l be done. 
Neither sha2l he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he sha2l magnify himself above a2l. 
But in his estate sha2l he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not sha2l he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things. 
Thus sha2l he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he sha2l acknowledge and increase with glory: and he sha2l cause them to rule over many, and sha2l divide the land for gain. 
And at the time of the end sha2l the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north sha2l come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he sha2l enter into the countries, and sha2l overflow and pa2s over. 
He sha2l enter also into the glorious land, and many countries sha2l be overthrown: but these sha2l escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of A2mon. 
He sha2l stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt sha2l not escape. 
But he sha2l have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over a2l the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians sha2l be at his steps. 
But tidings out of the east and out of the north sha2l trouble him: therefore he sha2l go forth with great fury to destroy, and u2terly to make away many. 
And he sha2l plant the tabernacles of his palace betw2en the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he sha2l come to his end, and none sha2l help him. 
And at that time sha2l Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there sha2l be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people sha2l be delivered, every one that sha2l be found wri2ten in the b2ok. 
And many of them that sl2ep in the dust of the earth sha2l awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. 
And they that be wise sha2l shine as the brightne2s of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousne2s as the stars for ever and ever. 
But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the b2ok, even to the time of the end: many sha2l run to and fro, and knowledge sha2l be increased. 
Then I Daniel l2oked, and, behold, there st2od other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river. 
And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long sha2l it be to the end of these wonders? 
And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it sha2l be for a time, times, and an half; and when he sha2l have a2complished to sca2ter the power of the holy people, a2l these things sha2l be finished. 
And I heard, but I underst2od not: then said I, O my Lord, what sha2l be the end of these things? 
And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed ti2l the time of the end. 
Many sha2l be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked sha2l do wickedly: and none of the wicked sha2l understand; but the wise sha2l understand. 
And from the time that the daily sacrifice sha2l be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there sha2l be a thousand two hundred and ninety days. 
Ble2sed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand thr2e hundred and five and thirty days. 
But go thou thy way ti2l the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days. 
The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of B2eri, in the days of U2ziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. 
The begi2ning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto th2e a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath co2mi2ted great whoredom, departing from the LORD. 
So he went and t2ok Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son. 
And the LORD said unto him, Ca2l his name Jezr2el; for yet a li2tle while, and I wi2l avenge the bl2od of Jezr2el upon the house of Jehu, and wi2l cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s at that day, that I wi2l break the bow of Israel, in the va2ley of Jezr2el. 
And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto him, Ca2l her name Loruhamah: for I wi2l no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I wi2l u2terly take them away. 
But I wi2l have mercy upon the house of Judah, and wi2l save them by the LORD their God, and wi2l not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by ba2tle, by horses, nor by horsemen. 
Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son. 
Then said God, Ca2l his name Loa2mi: for ye are not my people, and I wi2l not be your God. 
Yet the number of the children of Israel sha2l be as the sand of the sea, which ca2not be measured nor numbered; and it sha2l come to pa2s, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it sha2l be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God. 
Then sha2l the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and a2point themselves one head, and they sha2l come up out of the land: for great sha2l be the day of Jezr2el. 
Say ye unto your brethren, A2mi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah. 
Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight, and her adulteries from betw2en her breasts; 
Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderne2s, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst. 
And I wi2l not have mercy upon her children; for they be the children of whoredoms. 
For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefu2ly: for she said, I wi2l go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my w2ol and my flax, mine oil and my drink. 
Therefore, behold, I wi2l hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wa2l, that she sha2l not find her paths. 
And she sha2l fo2low after her lovers, but she sha2l not overtake them; and she sha2l s2ek them, but sha2l not find them: then sha2l she say, I wi2l go and return to my first husband; for then was it be2ter with me than now. 
For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for B2al. 
Therefore wi2l I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and wi2l recover my w2ol and my flax given to cover her nakedne2s. 
And now wi2l I discover her lewdne2s in the sight of her lovers, and none sha2l deliver her out of mine hand. 
I wi2l also cause a2l her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new m2ons, and her sa2baths, and a2l her solemn feasts. 
And I wi2l destroy her vines and her fig tr2es, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I wi2l make them a forest, and the beasts of the field sha2l eat them. 
And I wi2l visit upon her the days of B2alim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her ea2rings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD. 
Therefore, behold, I wi2l a2lure her, and bring her into the wilderne2s, and speak comfortably unto her. 
And I wi2l give her her vineyards from thence, and the va2ley of Achor for a d2or of hope: and she sha2l sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. 
And it sha2l be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt ca2l me Ishi; and shalt ca2l me no more B2ali. 
For I wi2l take away the names of B2alim out of her mouth, and they sha2l no more be remembered by their name. 
And in that day wi2l I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven, and with the cr2eping things of the ground: and I wi2l break the bow and the sword and the ba2tle out of the earth, and wi2l make them to lie down safely. 
And I wi2l betroth th2e unto me for ever; yea, I wi2l betroth th2e unto me in righteousne2s, and in judgment, and in lovingkindne2s, and in mercies. 
I wi2l even betroth th2e unto me in faithfulne2s: and thou shalt know the LORD. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, I wi2l hear, saith the LORD, I wi2l hear the heavens, and they sha2l hear the earth; 
And the earth sha2l hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they sha2l hear Jezr2el. 
And I wi2l sow her unto me in the earth; and I wi2l have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I wi2l say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they sha2l say, Thou art my God. 
Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, yet an adultere2s, a2cording to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who l2ok to other gods, and love flagons of wine. 
So I bought her to me for fift2en pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley: 
And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so wi2l I also be for th2e. 
For the children of Israel sha2l abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim: 
Afterward sha2l the children of Israel return, and s2ek the LORD their God, and David their king; and sha2l fear the LORD and his g2odne2s in the la2ter days. 
Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land. 
By swearing, and lying, and ki2ling, and stealing, and co2mi2ting adultery, they break out, and bl2od toucheth bl2od. 
Therefore sha2l the land mourn, and every one that dwe2leth therein sha2l languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also sha2l be taken away. 
Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as they that strive with the priest. 
Therefore shalt thou fa2l in the day, and the prophet also sha2l fa2l with th2e in the night, and I wi2l destroy thy mother. 
My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I wi2l also reject th2e, that thou shalt be no priest to me: s2eing thou hast forgo2ten the law of thy God, I wi2l also forget thy children. 
As they were increased, so they si2ned against me: therefore wi2l I change their glory into shame. 
They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity. 
And there sha2l be, like people, like priest: and I wi2l punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings. 
For they sha2l eat, and not have enough: they sha2l co2mit whoredom, and sha2l not increase: because they have left o2f to take h2ed to the LORD. 
Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart. 
My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their sta2f declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to e2r, and they have gone a whoring from under their God. 
They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hi2ls, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is g2od: therefore your daughters sha2l co2mit whoredom, and your spouses sha2l co2mit adultery. 
I wi2l not punish your daughters when they co2mit whoredom, nor your spouses when they co2mit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand sha2l fa2l. 
Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah o2fend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth. 
For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD wi2l f2ed them as a lamb in a large place. 
Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone. 
Their drink is sour: they have co2mi2ted whoredom continua2ly: her rulers with shame do love, Give ye. 
The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they sha2l be ashamed because of their sacrifices. 
Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you, because ye have b2en a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor. 
And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have b2en a rebuker of them a2l. 
I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou co2mi2test whoredom, and Israel is defiled. 
They wi2l not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD. 
And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore sha2l Israel and Ephraim fa2l in their iniquity: Judah also sha2l fa2l with them. 
They sha2l go with their flocks and with their herds to s2ek the LORD; but they sha2l not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from them. 
They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have bego2ten strange children: now sha2l a month devour them with their portions. 
Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Bethaven, after th2e, O Benjamin. 
Ephraim sha2l be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which sha2l surely be. 
The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: therefore I wi2l pour out my wrath upon them like water. 
Ephraim is o2pre2sed and broken in judgment, because he wi2lingly walked after the co2mandment. 
Therefore wi2l I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as ro2te2ne2s. 
When Ephraim saw his sickne2s, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the A2syrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound. 
For I wi2l be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, even I, wi2l tear and go away; I wi2l take away, and none sha2l rescue him. 
I wi2l go and return to my place, ti2l they acknowledge their o2fence, and s2ek my face: in their a2fliction they wi2l s2ek me early. 
Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he wi2l heal us; he hath smi2ten, and he wi2l bind us up. 
After two days wi2l he revive us: in the third day he wi2l raise us up, and we sha2l live in his sight. 
Then sha2l we know, if we fo2low on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he sha2l come unto us as the rain, as the la2ter and former rain unto the earth. 
O Ephraim, what sha2l I do unto th2e? O Judah, what sha2l I do unto th2e? for your g2odne2s is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away. 
Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth. 
For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt o2ferings. 
But they like men have transgre2sed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me. 
Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is po2luted with bl2od. 
And as tr2ops of ro2bers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they co2mit lewdne2s. 
I have s2en an ho2rible thing in the house of Israel: there is the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled. 
Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for th2e, when I returned the captivity of my people. 
When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedne2s of Samaria: for they co2mit falseh2od; and the thief cometh in, and the tr2op of ro2bers spoileth without. 
And they consider not in their hearts that I remember a2l their wickedne2s: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face. 
They make the king glad with their wickedne2s, and the princes with their lies. 
They are a2l adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened. 
In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bo2tles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners. 
For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sl2epeth a2l the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire. 
They are a2l hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; a2l their kings are fa2len: there is none among them that ca2leth unto me. 
Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned. 
Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not. 
And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor s2ek him for a2l this. 
Ephraim also is like a si2ly dove without heart: they ca2l to Egypt, they go to A2syria. 
When they sha2l go, I wi2l spread my net upon them; I wi2l bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I wi2l chastise them, as their congregation hath heard. 
Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgre2sed against me: though I have red2emed them, yet they have spoken lies against me. 
And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they a2semble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me. 
Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me. 
They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes sha2l fa2l by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this sha2l be their derision in the land of Egypt. 
Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He sha2l come as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgre2sed my covenant, and trespa2sed against my law. 
Israel sha2l cry unto me, My God, we know th2e. 
Israel hath cast o2f the thing that is g2od: the enemy sha2l pursue him. 
They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut o2f. 
Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast th2e o2f; mine anger is kindled against them: how long wi2l it be ere they a2tain to i2nocency? 
For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria sha2l be broken in pieces. 
For they have sown the wind, and they sha2l reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk; the bud sha2l yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers sha2l swa2low it up. 
Israel is swa2lowed up: now sha2l they be among the Gentiles as a ve2sel wherein is no pleasure. 
For they are gone up to A2syria, a wild a2s alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers. 
Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now wi2l I gather them, and they sha2l so2row a li2tle for the burden of the king of princes. 
Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars sha2l be unto him to sin. 
I have wri2ten to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing. 
They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine o2ferings, and eat it; but the LORD a2cepteth them not; now wi2l he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they sha2l return to Egypt. 
For Israel hath forgo2ten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I wi2l send a fire upon his cities, and it sha2l devour the palaces thereof. 
Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfl2or. 
The fl2or and the winepre2s sha2l not f2ed them, and the new wine sha2l fail in her. 
They sha2l not dwe2l in the LORD's land; but Ephraim sha2l return to Egypt, and they sha2l eat unclean things in A2syria. 
They sha2l not o2fer wine o2ferings to the LORD, neither sha2l they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices sha2l be unto them as the bread of mourners; a2l that eat thereof sha2l be po2luted: for their bread for their soul sha2l not come into the house of the LORD. 
What wi2l ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD? 
For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt sha2l gather them up, Memphis sha2l bury them: the pleasant places for their silver, ne2tles sha2l po2se2s them: thorns sha2l be in their tabernacles. 
The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel sha2l know it: the prophet is a f2ol, the spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred. 
The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in a2l his ways, and hatred in the house of his God. 
They have d2eply co2rupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: therefore he wi2l remember their iniquity, he wi2l visit their sins. 
I found Israel like grapes in the wilderne2s; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tr2e at her first time: but they went to B2alpeor, and separated themselves unto that shame; and their abominations were a2cording as they loved. 
As for Ephraim, their glory sha2l fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception. 
Though they bring up their children, yet wi2l I bereave them, that there sha2l not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them! 
Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim sha2l bring forth his children to the murderer. 
Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a misca2rying womb and dry breasts. 
A2l their wickedne2s is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedne2s of their doings I wi2l drive them out of mine house, I wi2l love them no more: a2l their princes are revolters. 
Ephraim is smi2ten, their r2ot is dried up, they sha2l bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet wi2l I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb. 
My God wi2l cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they sha2l be wanderers among the nations. 
Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: a2cording to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; a2cording to the g2odne2s of his land they have made g2odly images. 
Their heart is divided; now sha2l they be found faulty: he sha2l break down their altars, he sha2l spoil their images. 
For now they sha2l say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us? 
They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the fu2rows of the field. 
The inhabitants of Samaria sha2l fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof sha2l mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it. 
It sha2l be also ca2ried unto A2syria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim sha2l receive shame, and Israel sha2l be ashamed of his own counsel. 
As for Samaria, her king is cut o2f as the foam upon the water. 
The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, sha2l be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle sha2l come up on their altars; and they sha2l say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hi2ls, Fa2l on us. 
O Israel, thou hast si2ned from the days of Gibeah: there they st2od: the ba2tle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them. 
It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people sha2l be gathered against them, when they sha2l bind themselves in their two fu2rows. 
And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corn; but I pa2sed over upon her fair neck: I wi2l make Ephraim to ride; Judah sha2l plow, and Jacob sha2l break his clods. 
Sow to yourselves in righteousne2s, reap in mercy; break up your fa2low ground: for it is time to s2ek the LORD, ti2l he come and rain righteousne2s upon you. 
Ye have plowed wickedne2s, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men. 
Therefore sha2l a tumult arise among thy people, and a2l thy fortre2ses sha2l be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of ba2tle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children. 
So sha2l Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedne2s: in a morning sha2l the king of Israel u2terly be cut o2f. 
When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and ca2led my son out of Egypt. 
As they ca2led them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto B2alim, and burned incense to graven images. 
I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them. 
I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take o2f the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them. 
He sha2l not return into the land of Egypt, and the A2syrian sha2l be his king, because they refused to return. 
And the sword sha2l abide on his cities, and sha2l consume his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels. 
And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they ca2led them to the most High, none at a2l would exalt him. 
How sha2l I give th2e up, Ephraim? how sha2l I deliver th2e, Israel? how sha2l I make th2e as Admah? how sha2l I set th2e as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together. 
I wi2l not execute the fiercene2s of mine anger, I wi2l not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of th2e: and I wi2l not enter into the city. 
They sha2l walk after the LORD: he sha2l roar like a lion: when he sha2l roar, then the children sha2l tremble from the west. 
They sha2l tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of A2syria: and I wi2l place them in their houses, saith the LORD. 
Ephraim compa2seth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints. 
Ephraim f2edeth on wind, and fo2loweth after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the A2syrians, and oil is ca2ried into Egypt. 
The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and wi2l punish Jacob a2cording to his ways; a2cording to his doings wi2l he recompense him. 
He t2ok his brother by the h2el in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God: 
Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made su2plication unto him: he found him in Bethel, and there he spake with us; 
Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD is his memorial. 
Therefore turn thou to thy God: k2ep mercy and judgment and wait on thy God continua2ly. 
He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to o2pre2s. 
And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: in a2l my labours they sha2l find none iniquity in me that were sin. 
And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt wi2l yet make th2e to dwe2l in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast. 
I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets. 
Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bu2locks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps in the fu2rows of the fields. 
And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sh2ep. 
And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved. 
Ephraim provoked him to anger most bi2terly: therefore sha2l he leave his bl2od upon him, and his reproach sha2l his LORD return unto him. 
When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he o2fended in B2al, he died. 
And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, and idols a2cording to their own understanding, a2l of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice ki2s the calves. 
Therefore they sha2l be as the morning cloud and as the early dew that pa2seth away, as the cha2f that is driven with the whirlwind out of the fl2or, and as the smoke out of the chimney. 
Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for there is no saviour beside me. 
I did know th2e in the wilderne2s, in the land of great drought. 
A2cording to their pasture, so were they fi2led; they were fi2led, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgo2ten me. 
Therefore I wi2l be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way wi2l I observe them: 
I wi2l m2et them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and wi2l rend the caul of their heart, and there wi2l I devour them like a lion: the wild beast sha2l tear them. 
O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine help. 
I wi2l be thy king: where is any other that may save th2e in a2l thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes? 
I gave th2e a king in mine anger, and t2ok him away in my wrath. 
The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid. 
The so2rows of a travailing woman sha2l come upon him: he is an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children. 
I wi2l ransom them from the power of the grave; I wi2l red2em them from death: O death, I wi2l be thy plagues; O grave, I wi2l be thy destruction: repentance sha2l be hid from mine eyes. 
Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind sha2l come, the wind of the LORD sha2l come up from the wilderne2s, and his spring sha2l become dry, and his fountain sha2l be dried up: he sha2l spoil the treasure of a2l pleasant ve2sels. 
Samaria sha2l become desolate; for she hath rebe2led against her God: they sha2l fa2l by the sword: their infants sha2l be dashed in pieces, and their women with child sha2l be ri2ped up. 
O israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fa2len by thine iniquity. 
Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away a2l iniquity, and receive us graciously: so wi2l we render the calves of our lips. 
A2shur sha2l not save us; we wi2l not ride upon horses: neither wi2l we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in th2e the fatherle2s findeth mercy. 
I wi2l heal their backsliding, I wi2l love them fr2ely: for mine anger is turned away from him. 
I wi2l be as the dew unto Israel: he sha2l grow as the lily, and cast forth his r2ots as Lebanon. 
His branches sha2l spread, and his beauty sha2l be as the olive tr2e, and his sme2l as Lebanon. 
They that dwe2l under his shadow sha2l return; they sha2l revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof sha2l be as the wine of Lebanon. 
Ephraim sha2l say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard him, and observed him: I am like a gr2en fir tr2e. From me is thy fruit found. 
Who is wise, and he sha2l understand these things? prudent, and he sha2l know them? for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just sha2l walk in them: but the transgre2sors sha2l fa2l therein. 
The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel. 
Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, a2l ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this b2en in your days, or even in the days of your fathers? 
Te2l ye your children of it, and let your children te2l their children, and their children another generation. 
That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpi2ler eaten. 
Awake, ye drunkards, and w2ep; and howl, a2l ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut o2f from your mouth. 
For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose t2eth are the t2eth of a lion, and he hath the ch2ek t2eth of a great lion. 
He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tr2e: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white. 
Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth. 
The meat o2fering and the drink o2fering is cut o2f from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD's ministers, mourn. 
The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth. 
Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedre2sers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished. 
The vine is dried up, and the fig tr2e languisheth; the pomegranate tr2e, the palm tr2e also, and the a2ple tr2e, even a2l the tr2es of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men. 
Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie a2l night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat o2fering and the drink o2fering is wit2holden from the house of your God. 
Sanctify ye a fast, ca2l a solemn a2sembly, gather the elders and a2l the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto the LORD, 
Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty sha2l it come. 
Is not the meat cut o2f before our eyes, yea, joy and gladne2s from the house of our God? 
The s2ed is ro2ten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered. 
How do the beasts groan! the herds of ca2tle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sh2ep are made desolate. 
O LORD, to th2e wi2l I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderne2s, and the flame hath burned a2l the tr2es of the field. 
The beasts of the field cry also unto th2e: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderne2s. 
Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let a2l the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand; 
A day of darkne2s and of gl2omine2s, a day of clouds and of thick darkne2s, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not b2en ever the like, neither sha2l be any more after it, even to the years of many generations. 
A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderne2s; yea, and nothing sha2l escape them. 
The a2pearance of them is as the a2pearance of horses; and as horsemen, so sha2l they run. 
Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains sha2l they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stu2ble, as a strong people set in ba2tle a2ray. 
Before their face the people sha2l be much pained: a2l faces sha2l gather blackne2s. 
They sha2l run like mighty men; they sha2l climb the wa2l like men of war; and they sha2l march every one on his ways, and they sha2l not break their ranks: 
Neither sha2l one thrust another; they sha2l walk every one in his path: and when they fa2l upon the sword, they sha2l not be wounded. 
They sha2l run to and fro in the city; they sha2l run upon the wa2l, they sha2l climb up upon the houses; they sha2l enter in at the windows like a thief. 
The earth sha2l quake before them; the heavens sha2l tremble: the sun and the m2on sha2l be dark, and the stars sha2l withdraw their shining: 
And the LORD sha2l u2ter his voice before his army: for his camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the LORD is great and very te2rible; and who can abide it? 
Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with a2l your heart, and with fasting, and with w2eping, and with mourning: 
And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindne2s, and repenteth him of the evil. 
Who knoweth if he wi2l return and repent, and leave a ble2sing behind him; even a meat o2fering and a drink o2fering unto the LORD your God? 
Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, ca2l a solemn a2sembly: 
Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, a2semble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegr2om go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet. 
Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, w2ep betw2en the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God? 
Then wi2l the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people. 
Yea, the LORD wi2l answer and say unto his people, Behold, I wi2l send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye sha2l be satisfied therewith: and I wi2l no more make you a reproach among the heathen: 
But I wi2l remove far o2f from you the northern army, and wi2l drive him into a land ba2ren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink sha2l come up, and his i2l savour sha2l come up, because he hath done great things. 
Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD wi2l do great things. 
Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderne2s do spring, for the tr2e beareth her fruit, the fig tr2e and the vine do yield their strength. 
Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he wi2l cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the la2ter rain in the first month. 
And the fl2ors sha2l be fu2l of wheat, and the vats sha2l overflow with wine and oil. 
And I wi2l restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpi2ler, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you. 
And ye sha2l eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people sha2l never be ashamed. 
And ye sha2l know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people sha2l never be ashamed. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s afterward, that I wi2l pour out my spirit upon a2l flesh; and your sons and your daughters sha2l prophesy, your old men sha2l dream dreams, your young men sha2l s2e visions: 
And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days wi2l I pour out my spirit. 
And I wi2l shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, bl2od, and fire, and pi2lars of smoke. 
The sun sha2l be turned into darkne2s, and the m2on into bl2od, before the great and te2rible day of the LORD come. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that whosoever sha2l ca2l on the name of the LORD sha2l be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem sha2l be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORD sha2l ca2l. 
For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I sha2l bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, 
I wi2l also gather a2l nations, and wi2l bring them down into the va2ley of Jehoshaphat, and wi2l plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have sca2tered among the nations, and parted my land. 
And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink. 
Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and a2l the coasts of Palestine? wi2l ye render me a recompence? and if ye recompense me, swiftly and sp2edily wi2l I return your recompence upon your own head; 
Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have ca2ried into your temples my g2odly pleasant things: 
The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border. 
Behold, I wi2l raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and wi2l return your recompence upon your own head: 
And I wi2l se2l your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they sha2l se2l them to the Sabeans, to a people far o2f: for the LORD hath spoken it. 
Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let a2l the men of war draw near; let them come up: 
Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruningh2oks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong. 
A2semble yourselves, and come, a2l ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD. 
Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the va2ley of Jehoshaphat: for there wi2l I sit to judge a2l the heathen round about. 
Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the pre2s is fu2l, the fats overflow; for their wickedne2s is great. 
Multitudes, multitudes in the va2ley of decision: for the day of the LORD is near in the va2ley of decision. 
The sun and the m2on sha2l be darkened, and the stars sha2l withdraw their shining. 
The LORD also sha2l roar out of Zion, and u2ter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth sha2l shake: but the LORD wi2l be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel. 
So sha2l ye know that I am the LORD your God dwe2ling in Zion, my holy mountain: then sha2l Jerusalem be holy, and there sha2l no strangers pa2s through her any more. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, that the mountains sha2l drop down new wine, and the hi2ls sha2l flow with milk, and a2l the rivers of Judah sha2l flow with waters, and a fountain sha2l come forth out of the house of the LORD, and sha2l water the va2ley of Shi2tim. 
Egypt sha2l be a desolation, and Edom sha2l be a desolate wilderne2s, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed i2nocent bl2od in their land. 
But Judah sha2l dwe2l for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation. 
For I wi2l cleanse their bl2od that I have not cleansed: for the LORD dwe2leth in Zion. 
The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of U2ziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake. 
And he said, The LORD wi2l roar from Zion, and u2ter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds sha2l mourn, and the top of Carmel sha2l wither. 
Thus saith the LORD; For thr2e transgre2sions of Damascus, and for four, I wi2l not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron: 
But I wi2l send a fire into the house of Hazael, which sha2l devour the palaces of Benhadad. 
I wi2l break also the bar of Damascus, and cut o2f the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria sha2l go into captivity unto Kir, saith the LORD. 
Thus saith the LORD; For thr2e transgre2sions of Gaza, and for four, I wi2l not turn away the punishment thereof; because they ca2ried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom: 
But I wi2l send a fire on the wa2l of Gaza, which sha2l devour the palaces thereof: 
And I wi2l cut o2f the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I wi2l turn mine hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines sha2l perish, saith the Lord GOD. 
Thus saith the LORD; For thr2e transgre2sions of Tyrus, and for four, I wi2l not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant: 
But I wi2l send a fire on the wa2l of Tyrus, which sha2l devour the palaces thereof. 
Thus saith the LORD; For thr2e transgre2sions of Edom, and for four, I wi2l not turn away the punishment thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast o2f a2l pity, and his anger did tear perpetua2ly, and he kept his wrath for ever: 
But I wi2l send a fire upon Teman, which sha2l devour the palaces of Bozrah. 
Thus saith the LORD; For thr2e transgre2sions of the children of A2mon, and for four, I wi2l not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have ri2ped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border: 
But I wi2l kindle a fire in the wa2l of Ra2bah, and it sha2l devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of ba2tle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind: 
And their king sha2l go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith the LORD. 
Thus saith the LORD; For thr2e transgre2sions of Moab, and for four, I wi2l not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime: 
But I wi2l send a fire upon Moab, and it sha2l devour the palaces of Kirioth: and Moab sha2l die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet: 
And I wi2l cut o2f the judge from the midst thereof, and wi2l slay a2l the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD. 
Thus saith the LORD; For thr2e transgre2sions of Judah, and for four, I wi2l not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his co2mandments, and their lies caused them to e2r, after the which their fathers have walked: 
But I wi2l send a fire upon Judah, and it sha2l devour the palaces of Jerusalem. 
Thus saith the LORD; For thr2e transgre2sions of Israel, and for four, I wi2l not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the p2or for a pair of shoes; 
That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the p2or, and turn aside the way of the m2ek: and a man and his father wi2l go in unto the same maid, to profane my holy name: 
And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god. 
Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his r2ots from beneath. 
Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderne2s, to po2se2s the land of the Amorite. 
And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD. 
But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and co2manded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not. 
Behold, I am pre2sed under you, as a cart is pre2sed that is fu2l of sheaves. 
Therefore the flight sha2l perish from the swift, and the strong sha2l not strengthen his force, neither sha2l the mighty deliver himself: 
Neither sha2l he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of f2ot sha2l not deliver himself: neither sha2l he that rideth the horse deliver himself. 
And he that is courageous among the mighty sha2l fl2e away naked in that day, saith the LORD. 
Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying, 
You only have I known of a2l the families of the earth: therefore I wi2l punish you for a2l your iniquities. 
Can two walk together, except they be agr2ed? 
Wi2l a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? wi2l a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing? 
Can a bird fa2l in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is for him? sha2l one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at a2l? 
Sha2l a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? sha2l there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it? 
Surely the Lord GOD wi2l do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets. 
The lion hath roared, who wi2l not fear? the Lord GOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy? 
Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, A2semble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the o2pre2sed in the midst thereof. 
For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up violence and ro2bery in their palaces. 
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary there sha2l be even round about the land; and he sha2l bring down thy strength from th2e, and thy palaces sha2l be spoiled. 
Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so sha2l the children of Israel be taken out that dwe2l in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch. 
Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord GOD, the God of hosts, 
That in the day that I sha2l visit the transgre2sions of Israel upon him I wi2l also visit the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altar sha2l be cut o2f, and fa2l to the ground. 
And I wi2l smite the winter house with the su2mer house; and the houses of ivory sha2l perish, and the great houses sha2l have an end, saith the LORD. 
Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, which o2pre2s the p2or, which crush the n2edy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink. 
The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holine2s, that, lo, the days sha2l come upon you, that he wi2l take you away with h2oks, and your posterity with fis2h2oks. 
And ye sha2l go out at the breaches, every cow at that which is before her; and ye sha2l cast them into the palace, saith the LORD. 
Come to Bethel, and transgre2s; at Gilgal multiply transgre2sion; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after thr2e years: 
And o2fer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim and publish the fr2e o2ferings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD. 
And I also have given you clea2ne2s of t2eth in a2l your cities, and want of bread in a2l your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. 
And also I have wit2holden the rain from you, when there were yet thr2e months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered. 
So two or thr2e cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. 
I have smi2ten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig tr2es and your olive tr2es increased, the palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. 
I have sent among you the pestilence after the ma2ner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. 
I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomo2rah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD. 
Therefore thus wi2l I do unto th2e, O Israel: and because I wi2l do this unto th2e, prepare to m2et thy God, O Israel. 
For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkne2s, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name. 
Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O house of Israel. 
The virgin of Israel is fa2len; she sha2l no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up. 
For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand sha2l leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred sha2l leave ten, to the house of Israel. 
For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, S2ek ye me, and ye sha2l live: 
But s2ek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pa2s not to B2ersheba: for Gilgal sha2l surely go into captivity, and Bethel sha2l come to nought. 
S2ek the LORD, and ye sha2l live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel. 
Ye who turn judgment to wormw2od, and leave o2f righteousne2s in the earth, 
S2ek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that ca2leth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name: 
That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled sha2l come against the fortre2s. 
They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly. 
Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the p2or, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye sha2l not dwe2l in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye sha2l not drink wine of them. 
For I know your manifold transgre2sions and your mighty sins: they a2flict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the p2or in the gate from their right. 
Therefore the prudent sha2l k2ep silence in that time; for it is an evil time. 
S2ek g2od, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, sha2l be with you, as ye have spoken. 
Hate the evil, and love the g2od, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts wi2l be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph. 
Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, saith thus; Wailing sha2l be in a2l str2ets; and they sha2l say in a2l the highways, Alas! alas! and they sha2l ca2l the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing. 
And in a2l vineyards sha2l be wailing: for I wi2l pa2s through th2e, saith the LORD. 
Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkne2s, and not light. 
As if a man did fl2e from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wa2l, and a serpent bit him. 
Sha2l not the day of the LORD be darkne2s, and not light? even very dark, and no brightne2s in it? 
I hate, I despise your feast days, and I wi2l not sme2l in your solemn a2semblies. 
Though ye o2fer me burnt o2ferings and your meat o2ferings, I wi2l not a2cept them: neither wi2l I regard the peace o2ferings of your fat beasts. 
Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I wi2l not hear the melody of thy viols. 
But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousne2s as a mighty stream. 
Have ye o2fered unto me sacrifices and o2ferings in the wilderne2s forty years, O house of Israel? 
But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves. 
Therefore wi2l I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts. 
Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came! 
Pa2s ye unto Calneh, and s2e; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they be2ter than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border? 
Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near; 
That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the sta2l; 
That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David; 
That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the a2fliction of Joseph. 
Therefore now sha2l they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves sha2l be removed. 
The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the exce2lency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore wi2l I deliver up the city with a2l that is therein. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, if there remain ten men in one house, that they sha2l die. 
And a man's uncle sha2l take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and sha2l say unto him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with th2e? and he sha2l say, No. Then sha2l he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD. 
For, behold, the LORD co2mandeth, and he wi2l smite the great house with breaches, and the li2tle house with clefts. 
Sha2l horses run upon the rock? wi2l one plow there with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into ga2l, and the fruit of righteousne2s into hemlock: 
Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength? 
But, behold, I wi2l raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they sha2l a2flict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderne2s. 
Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed gra2sho2pers in the begi2ning of the sh2oting up of the la2ter growth; and, lo, it was the la2ter growth after the king's mowings. 
And it came to pa2s, that when they had made an end of eating the gra2s of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I bes2ech th2e: by whom sha2l Jacob arise? for he is sma2l. 
The LORD repented for this: It sha2l not be, saith the LORD. 
Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD ca2led to contend by fire, and it devoured the great d2ep, and did eat up a part. 
Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I bes2ech th2e: by whom sha2l Jacob arise? for he is sma2l. 
The LORD repented for this: This also sha2l not be, saith the Lord GOD. 
Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the LORD st2od upon a wa2l made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand. 
And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what s2est thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the LORD, Behold, I wi2l set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I wi2l not again pa2s by them any more: 
And the high places of Is2ac sha2l be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel sha2l be laid waste; and I wi2l rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword. 
Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against th2e in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear a2l his words. 
For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam sha2l die by the sword, and Israel sha2l surely be led away captive out of their own land. 
Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou s2er, go, fl2e th2e away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there: 
But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the king's chapel, and it is the king's court. 
Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit: 
And the LORD t2ok me as I fo2lowed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel. 
Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Is2ac. 
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife sha2l be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters sha2l fa2l by the sword, and thy land sha2l be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a po2luted land: and Israel sha2l surely go into captivity forth of his land. 
Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and behold a basket of su2mer fruit. 
And he said, Amos, what s2est thou? And I said, A basket of su2mer fruit. Then said the LORD unto me, The end is come upon my people of Israel; I wi2l not again pa2s by them any more. 
And the songs of the temple sha2l be howlings in that day, saith the Lord GOD: there sha2l be many dead bodies in every place; they sha2l cast them forth with silence. 
Hear this, O ye that swa2low up the n2edy, even to make the p2or of the land to fail, 
Saying, When wi2l the new m2on be gone, that we may se2l corn? and the sa2bath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah sma2l, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit? 
That we may buy the p2or for silver, and the n2edy for a pair of shoes; yea, and se2l the refuse of the wheat? 
The LORD hath sworn by the exce2lency of Jacob, Surely I wi2l never forget any of their works. 
Sha2l not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwe2leth therein? and it sha2l rise up who2ly as a fl2od; and it sha2l be cast out and drowned, as by the fl2od of Egypt. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, saith the Lord GOD, that I wi2l cause the sun to go down at n2on, and I wi2l darken the earth in the clear day: 
And I wi2l turn your feasts into mourning, and a2l your songs into lamentation; and I wi2l bring up sackcloth upon a2l loins, and baldne2s upon every head; and I wi2l make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bi2ter day. 
Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I wi2l send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD: 
And they sha2l wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they sha2l run to and fro to s2ek the word of the LORD, and sha2l not find it. 
In that day sha2l the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst. 
They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O Dan, liveth; and, The ma2ner of B2ersheba liveth; even they sha2l fa2l, and never rise up again. 
I saw the LORD standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the d2or, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, a2l of them; and I wi2l slay the last of them with the sword: he that fl2eth of them sha2l not fl2e away, and he that escapeth of them sha2l not be delivered. 
Though they dig into he2l, thence sha2l mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence wi2l I bring them down: 
And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I wi2l search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bo2tom of the sea, thence wi2l I co2mand the serpent, and he sha2l bite them: 
And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence wi2l I co2mand the sword, and it sha2l slay them: and I wi2l set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for g2od. 
And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it sha2l melt, and a2l that dwe2l therein sha2l mourn: and it sha2l rise up who2ly like a fl2od; and sha2l be drowned, as by the fl2od of Egypt. 
It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his tr2op in the earth; he that ca2leth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name. 
Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir? 
Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I wi2l destroy it from o2f the face of the earth; saving that I wi2l not u2terly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD. 
For, lo, I wi2l co2mand, and I wi2l sift the house of Israel among a2l nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet sha2l not the least grain fa2l upon the earth. 
A2l the si2ners of my people sha2l die by the sword, which say, The evil sha2l not overtake nor prevent us. 
In that day wi2l I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fa2len, and close up the breaches thereof; and I wi2l raise up his ruins, and I wi2l build it as in the days of old: 
That they may po2se2s the remnant of Edom, and of a2l the heathen, which are ca2led by my name, saith the LORD that doeth this. 
Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman sha2l overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth s2ed; and the mountains sha2l drop sw2et wine, and a2l the hi2ls sha2l melt. 
And I wi2l bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they sha2l build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they sha2l plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they sha2l also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them. 
And I wi2l plant them upon their land, and they sha2l no more be pu2led up out of their land which I have given them, saith the LORD thy God. 
The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an amba2sador is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in ba2tle. 
Behold, I have made th2e sma2l among the heathen: thou art greatly despised. 
The pride of thine heart hath deceived th2e, thou that dwe2lest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who sha2l bring me down to the ground? 
Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence wi2l I bring th2e down, saith the LORD. 
If thieves came to th2e, if ro2bers by night, (how art thou cut o2f!) would they not have stolen ti2l they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to th2e, would they not leave some grapes? 
How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hi2den things sought up! 
A2l the men of thy confederacy have brought th2e even to the border: the men that were at peace with th2e have deceived th2e, and prevailed against th2e; that they eat thy bread have laid a wound under th2e: there is none understanding in him. 
Sha2l I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau? 
And thy mighty men, O Teman, sha2l be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut o2f by slaughter. 
For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame sha2l cover th2e, and thou shalt be cut o2f for ever. 
In the day that thou st2odest on the other side, in the day that the strangers ca2ried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them. 
But thou shouldest not have l2oked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distre2s. 
Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have l2oked on their a2fliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity; 
Neither shouldest thou have st2od in the cro2sway, to cut o2f those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distre2s. 
For the day of the LORD is near upon a2l the heathen: as thou hast done, it sha2l be done unto th2e: thy reward sha2l return upon thine own head. 
For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so sha2l a2l the heathen drink continua2ly, yea, they sha2l drink, and they sha2l swa2low down, and they sha2l be as though they had not b2en. 
But upon mount Zion sha2l be deliverance, and there sha2l be holine2s; and the house of Jacob sha2l po2se2s their po2se2sions. 
And the house of Jacob sha2l be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stu2ble, and they sha2l kindle in them, and devour them; and there sha2l not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken it. 
And they of the south sha2l po2se2s the mount of Esau; and they of the plain the Philistines: and they sha2l po2se2s the fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin sha2l po2se2s Gilead. 
And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel sha2l po2se2s that of the Can2anites, even unto Zarephath; and the captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, sha2l po2se2s the cities of the south. 
And saviours sha2l come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom sha2l be the LORD's. 
Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Ami2tai, saying, 
Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedne2s is come up before me. 
But Jonah rose up to fl2e unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Jo2pa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. 
But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken. 
Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asl2ep. 
So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sl2eper? arise, ca2l upon thy God, if so be that God wi2l think upon us, that we perish not. 
And they said every one to his fe2low, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fe2l upon Jonah. 
Then said they unto him, Te2l us, we pray th2e, for whose cause this evil is upon us; What is thine o2cupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou? 
And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land. 
Then were the men exc2edingly afraid, and said unto him. Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them. 
Then said they unto him, What sha2l we do unto th2e, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous. 
And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so sha2l the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you. 
Neverthele2s the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them. 
Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We bes2ech th2e, O LORD, we bes2ech th2e, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us i2nocent bl2od: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased th2e. 
So they l2ok up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging. 
Then the men feared the LORD exc2edingly, and o2fered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows. 
Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swa2low up Jonah. And Jonah was in the be2ly of the fish thr2e days and thr2e nights. 
Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's be2ly, 
And said, I cried by reason of mine a2fliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the be2ly of he2l cried I, and thou heardest my voice. 
For thou hadst cast me into the d2ep, in the midst of the seas; and the fl2ods compa2sed me about: a2l thy bi2lows and thy waves pa2sed over me. 
Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I wi2l l2ok again toward thy holy temple. 
The waters compa2sed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the w2eds were wra2ped about my head. 
I went down to the bo2toms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from co2ruption, O LORD my God. 
When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto th2e, into thine holy temple. 
They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy. 
But I wi2l sacrifice unto th2e with the voice of thanksgiving; I wi2l pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD. 
And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land. 
And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying, 
Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid th2e. 
So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, a2cording to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exc2eding great city of thr2e days' journey. 
And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh sha2l be overthrown. 
So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. 
For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. 
And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decr2e of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not f2ed, nor drink water: 
But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. 
Who can te2l if God wi2l turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? 
And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not. 
But it displeased Jonah exc2edingly, and he was very angry. 
And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray th2e, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindne2s, and repentest th2e of the evil. 
Therefore now, O LORD, take, I bes2ech th2e, my life from me; for it is be2ter for me to die than to live. 
Then said the LORD, Doest thou we2l to be angry? 
So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a b2oth, and sat under it in the shadow, ti2l he might s2e what would become of the city. 
And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exc2eding glad of the gourd. 
But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered. 
And it came to pa2s, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is be2ter for me to die than to live. 
And God said to Jonah, Doest thou we2l to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do we2l to be angry, even unto death. 
Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night: 
And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons that ca2not discern betw2en their right hand and their left hand; and also much ca2tle? 
The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem. 
Hear, a2l ye people; hearken, O earth, and a2l that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witne2s against you, the LORD from his holy temple. 
For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and wi2l come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth. 
And the mountains sha2l be molten under him, and the va2leys sha2l be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured down a st2ep place. 
For the transgre2sion of Jacob is a2l this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgre2sion of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem? 
Therefore I wi2l make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: and I wi2l pour down the stones thereof into the va2ley, and I wi2l discover the foundations thereof. 
And a2l the graven images thereof sha2l be beaten to pieces, and a2l the hires thereof sha2l be burned with the fire, and a2l the idols thereof wi2l I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they sha2l return to the hire of an harlot. 
Therefore I wi2l wail and howl, I wi2l go stri2ped and naked: I wi2l make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls. 
For her wound is incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem. 
Declare ye it not at Gath, w2ep ye not at a2l: in the house of Aphrah ro2l thyself in the dust. 
Pa2s ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Z2anan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he sha2l receive of you his standing. 
For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefu2ly for g2od: but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem. 
O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she is the begi2ning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgre2sions of Israel were found in th2e. 
Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib sha2l be a lie to the kings of Israel. 
Yet wi2l I bring an heir unto th2e, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he sha2l come unto Adu2lam the glory of Israel. 
Make th2e bald, and po2l th2e for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldne2s as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from th2e. 
Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand. 
And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they o2pre2s a man and his house, even a man and his heritage. 
Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye sha2l not remove your necks; neither sha2l ye go haughtily: for this time is evil. 
In that day sha2l one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be u2terly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields. 
Therefore thou shalt have none that sha2l cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD. 
Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they sha2l not prophesy to them, that they sha2l not take shame. 
O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do g2od to him that walketh uprightly? 
Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pu2l o2f the robe with the garment from them that pa2s by securely as men averse from war. 
The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever. 
Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is po2luted, it sha2l destroy you, even with a sore destruction. 
If a man walking in the spirit and falseh2od do lie, saying, I wi2l prophesy unto th2e of wine and of strong drink; he sha2l even be the prophet of this people. 
I wi2l surely a2semble, O Jacob, a2l of th2e; I wi2l surely gather the remnant of Israel; I wi2l put them together as the sh2ep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they sha2l make great noise by reason of the multitude of men. 
The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have pa2sed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king sha2l pa2s before them, and the LORD on the head of them. 
And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment? 
Who hate the g2od, and love the evil; who pluck o2f their skin from o2f them, and their flesh from o2f their bones; 
Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from o2f them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron. 
Then sha2l they cry unto the LORD, but he wi2l not hear them: he wi2l even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves i2l in their doings. 
Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people e2r, that bite with their t2eth, and cry, Peace; and he that pu2teth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him. 
Therefore night sha2l be unto you, that ye sha2l not have a vision; and it sha2l be dark unto you, that ye sha2l not divine; and the sun sha2l go down over the prophets, and the day sha2l be dark over them. 
Then sha2l the s2ers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they sha2l a2l cover their lips; for there is no answer of God. 
But truly I am fu2l of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgre2sion, and to Israel his sin. 
Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert a2l equity. 
They build up Zion with bl2od, and Jerusalem with iniquity. 
The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet wi2l they lean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us. 
Therefore sha2l Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem sha2l become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest. 
But in the last days it sha2l come to pa2s, that the mountain of the house of the LORD sha2l be established in the top of the mountains, and it sha2l be exalted above the hi2ls; and people sha2l flow unto it. 
And many nations sha2l come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he wi2l teach us of his ways, and we wi2l walk in his paths: for the law sha2l go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. 
And he sha2l judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar o2f; and they sha2l beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruningh2oks: nation sha2l not lift up a sword against nation, neither sha2l they learn war any more. 
But they sha2l sit every man under his vine and under his fig tr2e; and none sha2l make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken it. 
For a2l people wi2l walk every one in the name of his god, and we wi2l walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever. 
In that day, saith the LORD, wi2l I a2semble her that halteth, and I wi2l gather her that is driven out, and her that I have a2flicted; 
And I wi2l make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far o2f a strong nation: and the LORD sha2l reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever. 
And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto th2e sha2l it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom sha2l come to the daughter of Jerusalem. 
Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in th2e? is thy counse2lor perished? for pangs have taken th2e as a woman in travail. 
Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwe2l in the field, and thou shalt go even to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD sha2l red2em th2e from the hand of thine enemies. 
Now also many nations are gathered against th2e, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye l2ok upon Zion. 
But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he sha2l gather them as the sheaves into the fl2or. 
Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I wi2l make thine horn iron, and I wi2l make thy h2ofs bra2s: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I wi2l consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth. 
Now gather thyself in tr2ops, O daughter of tr2ops: he hath laid siege against us: they sha2l smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the ch2ek. 
But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be li2tle among the thousands of Judah, yet out of th2e sha2l he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have b2en from of old, from everlasting. 
Therefore wi2l he give them up, until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren sha2l return unto the children of Israel. 
And he sha2l stand and f2ed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they sha2l abide: for now sha2l he be great unto the ends of the earth. 
And this man sha2l be the peace, when the A2syrian sha2l come into our land: and when he sha2l tread in our palaces, then sha2l we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men. 
And they sha2l waste the land of A2syria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus sha2l he deliver us from the A2syrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders. 
And the remnant of Jacob sha2l be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the gra2s, that ta2rieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men. 
And the remnant of Jacob sha2l be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sh2ep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver. 
Thine hand sha2l be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and a2l thine enemies sha2l be cut o2f. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, saith the LORD, that I wi2l cut o2f thy horses out of the midst of th2e, and I wi2l destroy thy chariots: 
And I wi2l cut o2f the cities of thy land, and throw down a2l thy strong holds: 
And I wi2l cut o2f witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no more s2othsayers: 
Thy graven images also wi2l I cut o2f, and thy standing images out of the midst of th2e; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands. 
And I wi2l pluck up thy groves out of the midst of th2e: so wi2l I destroy thy cities. 
And I wi2l execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard. 
Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hi2ls hear thy voice. 
Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD's controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he wi2l plead with Israel. 
O my people, what have I done unto th2e? and wherein have I wearied th2e? testify against me. 
For I brought th2e up out of the land of Egypt, and red2emed th2e out of the house of servants; and I sent before th2e Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. 
O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Bal2am the son of Beor answered him from Shi2tim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousne2s of the LORD. 
Wherewith sha2l I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? sha2l I come before him with burnt o2ferings, with calves of a year old? 
Wi2l the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? sha2l I give my firstborn for my transgre2sion, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? 
He hath shewed th2e, O man, what is g2od; and what doth the LORD require of th2e, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? 
The LORD's voice crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom sha2l s2e thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath a2pointed it. 
Are there yet the treasures of wickedne2s in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable? 
Sha2l I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights? 
For the rich men thereof are fu2l of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth. 
Therefore also wi2l I make th2e sick in smiting th2e, in making th2e desolate because of thy sins. 
Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down sha2l be in the midst of th2e; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and that which thou deliverest wi2l I give up to the sword. 
Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint th2e with oil; and sw2et wine, but shalt not drink wine. 
For the statutes of Omri are kept, and a2l the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make th2e a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hi2sing: therefore ye sha2l bear the reproach of my people. 
Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the su2mer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit. 
The g2od man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright among men: they a2l lie in wait for bl2od; they hunt every man his brother with a net. 
That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he u2tereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up. 
The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh; now sha2l be their perplexity. 
Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: k2ep the d2ors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. 
For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house. 
Therefore I wi2l l2ok unto the LORD; I wi2l wait for the God of my salvation: my God wi2l hear me. 
Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fa2l, I sha2l arise; when I sit in darkne2s, the LORD sha2l be a light unto me. 
I wi2l bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have si2ned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he wi2l bring me forth to the light, and I sha2l behold his righteousne2s. 
Then she that is mine enemy sha2l s2e it, and shame sha2l cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes sha2l behold her: now sha2l she be tro2den down as the mire of the str2ets. 
In the day that thy wa2ls are to be built, in that day sha2l the decr2e be far removed. 
In that day also he sha2l come even to th2e from A2syria, and from the fortified cities, and from the fortre2s even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain. 
Notwithstanding the land sha2l be desolate because of them that dwe2l therein, for the fruit of their doings. 
F2ed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwe2l solitarily in the w2od, in the midst of Carmel: let them f2ed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old. 
A2cording to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt wi2l I shew unto him marve2lous things. 
The nations sha2l s2e and be confounded at a2l their might: they sha2l lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears sha2l be deaf. 
They sha2l lick the dust like a serpent, they sha2l move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they sha2l be afraid of the LORD our God, and sha2l fear because of th2e. 
Who is a God like unto th2e, that pardoneth iniquity, and pa2seth by the transgre2sion of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy. 
He wi2l turn again, he wi2l have compa2sion upon us; he wi2l subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast a2l their sins into the depths of the sea. 
Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old. 
The burden of Nineveh. The b2ok of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite. 
God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and is furious; the LORD wi2l take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies. 
The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and wi2l not at a2l acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his f2et. 
He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up a2l the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth. 
The mountains quake at him, and the hi2ls melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and a2l that dwe2l therein. 
Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fiercene2s of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him. 
The LORD is g2od, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him. 
But with an ove2ru2ning fl2od he wi2l make an u2ter end of the place thereof, and darkne2s sha2l pursue his enemies. 
What do ye imagine against the LORD? he wi2l make an u2ter end: a2fliction sha2l not rise up the second time. 
For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they are drunken as drunkards, they sha2l be devoured as stu2ble fu2ly dry. 
There is one come out of th2e, that imagineth evil against the LORD, a wicked counse2lor. 
Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet thus sha2l they be cut down, when he sha2l pa2s through. Though I have a2flicted th2e, I wi2l a2flict th2e no more. 
For now wi2l I break his yoke from o2f th2e, and wi2l burst thy bonds in sunder. 
And the LORD hath given a co2mandment concerning th2e, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods wi2l I cut o2f the graven image and the molten image: I wi2l make thy grave; for thou art vile. 
Behold upon the mountains the f2et of him that bringeth g2od tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, k2ep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked sha2l no more pa2s through th2e; he is u2terly cut o2f. 
He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: k2ep the munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily. 
For the LORD hath turned away the exce2lency of Jacob, as the exce2lency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and ma2red their vine branches. 
The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots sha2l be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir tr2es sha2l be te2ribly shaken. 
The chariots sha2l rage in the str2ets, they sha2l justle one against another in the broad ways: they sha2l s2em like torches, they sha2l run like the lightnings. 
He sha2l recount his worthies: they sha2l stumble in their walk; they sha2l make haste to the wa2l thereof, and the defence sha2l be prepared. 
The gates of the rivers sha2l be opened, and the palace sha2l be di2solved. 
And Hu2zab sha2l be led away captive, she sha2l be brought up, and her maids sha2l lead her as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts. 
But Nineveh is of old like a p2ol of water: yet they sha2l fl2e away. Stand, stand, sha2l they cry; but none sha2l l2ok back. 
Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there is none end of the store and glory out of a2l the pleasant furniture. 
She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the kn2es smite together, and much pain is in a2l loins, and the faces of them a2l gather blackne2s. 
Where is the dwe2ling of the lions, and the f2edingplace of the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid? 
The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lione2ses, and fi2led his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin. 
Behold, I am against th2e, saith the LORD of hosts, and I wi2l burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword sha2l devour thy young lions: and I wi2l cut o2f thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy me2sengers sha2l no more be heard. 
Woe to the bl2ody city! it is a2l fu2l of lies and ro2bery; the prey departeth not; 
The noise of a whip, and the noise of the ra2tling of the wh2els, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots. 
The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the gli2tering spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases; and there is none end of their corpses; they stumble upon their corpses: 
Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the we2lfavoured harlot, the mistre2s of witchcrafts, that se2leth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts. 
Behold, I am against th2e, saith the LORD of hosts; and I wi2l discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I wi2l shew the nations thy nakedne2s, and the kingdoms thy shame. 
And I wi2l cast abominable filth upon th2e, and make th2e vile, and wi2l set th2e as a gazingstock. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that a2l they that l2ok upon th2e sha2l fl2e from th2e, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who wi2l bemoan her? whence sha2l I s2ek comforters for th2e? 
Art thou be2ter than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wa2l was from the sea? 
Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers. 
Yet was she ca2ried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of a2l the str2ets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and a2l her great men were bound in chains. 
Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt s2ek strength because of the enemy. 
A2l thy strong holds sha2l be like fig tr2es with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they sha2l even fa2l into the mouth of the eater. 
Behold, thy people in the midst of th2e are women: the gates of thy land sha2l be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire sha2l devour thy bars. 
Draw th2e waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the bric2kiln. 
There sha2l the fire devour th2e; the sword sha2l cut th2e o2f, it sha2l eat th2e up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts. 
Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and fl2eth away. 
Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the great gra2sho2pers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun ariseth they fl2e away, and their place is not known where they are. 
Thy shepherds slumber, O king of A2syria: thy nobles sha2l dwe2l in the dust: thy people is sca2tered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth them. 
There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: a2l that hear the bruit of th2e sha2l clap the hands over th2e: for upon whom hath not thy wickedne2s pa2sed continua2ly? 
The burden which Haba2kuk the prophet did s2e. 
O LORD, how long sha2l I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out unto th2e of violence, and thou wilt not save! 
Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention. 
Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compa2s about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proc2edeth. 
Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I wi2l work a work in your days which ye wi2l not believe, though it be told you. 
For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bi2ter and hasty nation, which sha2l march through the breadth of the land, to po2se2s the dwe2lingplaces that are not their's. 
They are te2rible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity sha2l proc2ed of themselves. 
Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen sha2l spread themselves, and their horsemen sha2l come from far; they sha2l fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat. 
They sha2l come a2l for violence: their faces sha2l sup up as the east wind, and they sha2l gather the captivity as the sand. 
And they sha2l sco2f at the kings, and the princes sha2l be a scorn unto them: they sha2l deride every strong hold; for they sha2l heap dust, and take it. 
Then sha2l his mind change, and he sha2l pa2s over, and o2fend, imputing this his power unto his god. 
Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we sha2l not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for co2rection. 
Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not l2ok on iniquity: wherefore l2okest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he? 
And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the cr2eping things, that have no ruler over them? 
They take up a2l of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad. 
Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous. 
Sha2l they therefore empty their net, and not spare continua2ly to slay the nations? 
I wi2l stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and wi2l watch to s2e what he wi2l say unto me, and what I sha2l answer when I am reproved. 
And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. 
For the vision is yet for an a2pointed time, but at the end it sha2l speak, and not lie: though it ta2ry, wait for it; because it wi2l surely come, it wi2l not ta2ry. 
Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just sha2l live by his faith. 
Yea also, because he transgre2seth by wine, he is a proud man, neither k2epeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as he2l, and is as death, and ca2not be satisfied, but gathereth unto him a2l nations, and heapeth unto him a2l people: 
Sha2l not a2l these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay! 
Sha2l they not rise up su2denly that sha2l bite th2e, and awake that sha2l vex th2e, and thou shalt be for b2oties unto them? 
Because thou hast spoiled many nations, a2l the remnant of the people sha2l spoil th2e; because of men's bl2od, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of a2l that dwe2l therein. 
Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousne2s to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil! 
Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cu2ting o2f many people, and hast si2ned against thy soul. 
For the stone sha2l cry out of the wa2l, and the beam out of the timber sha2l answer it. 
Woe to him that buildeth a town with bl2od, and stablisheth a city by iniquity! 
Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people sha2l labour in the very fire, and the people sha2l weary themselves for very vanity? 
For the earth sha2l be fi2led with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea. 
Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that pu2test thy bo2tle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest l2ok on their nakedne2s! 
Thou art fi2led with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD's right hand sha2l be turned unto th2e, and shameful spewing sha2l be on thy glory. 
For the violence of Lebanon sha2l cover th2e, and the spoil of beasts, which made them afraid, because of men's bl2od, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of a2l that dwe2l therein. 
What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols? 
Woe unto him that saith to the w2od, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it sha2l teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and there is no breath at a2l in the midst of it. 
But the LORD is in his holy temple: let a2l the earth k2ep silence before him. 
A prayer of Haba2kuk the prophet upon Shigionoth. 
O LORD, I have heard thy sp2ech, and was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy. 
God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was fu2l of his praise. 
And his brightne2s was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power. 
Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his f2et. 
He st2od, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were sca2tered, the perpetual hi2ls did bow: his ways are everlasting. 
I saw the tents of Cushan in a2fliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble. 
Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was thine anger against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation? 
Thy bow was made quite naked, a2cording to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers. 
The mountains saw th2e, and they trembled: the overflowing of the water pa2sed by: the d2ep u2tered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high. 
The sun and m2on st2od sti2l in their habitation: at the light of thine a2rows they went, and at the shining of thy gli2tering spear. 
Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger. 
Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah. 
Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his vi2lages: they came out as a whirlwind to sca2ter me: their rejoicing was as to devour the p2or secretly. 
Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the heap of great waters. 
When I heard, my be2ly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: ro2te2ne2s entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he wi2l invade them with his tr2ops. 
Although the fig tr2e sha2l not blo2som, neither sha2l fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive sha2l fail, and the fields sha2l yield no meat; the flock sha2l be cut o2f from the fold, and there sha2l be no herd in the sta2ls: 
Yet I wi2l rejoice in the LORD, I wi2l joy in the God of my salvation. 
The LORD God is my strength, and he wi2l make my f2et like hinds' f2et, and he wi2l make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments. 
The word of the LORD which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah. 
I wi2l u2terly consume a2l things from o2f the land, saith the LORD. 
I wi2l consume man and beast; I wi2l consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling blocks with the wicked: and I wi2l cut o2f man from o2f the land, saith the LORD. 
I wi2l also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon a2l the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I wi2l cut o2f the remnant of B2al from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the priests; 
And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham; 
And them that are turned back from the LORD; and those that have not sought the LORD, nor enquired for him. 
Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the LORD is at hand: for the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice, he hath bid his guests. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in the day of the LORD's sacrifice, that I wi2l punish the princes, and the king's children, and a2l such as are clothed with strange a2parel. 
In the same day also wi2l I punish a2l those that leap on the threshold, which fi2l their masters' houses with violence and deceit. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, saith the LORD, that there sha2l be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hi2ls. 
Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for a2l the merchant people are cut down; a2l they that bear silver are cut o2f. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s at that time, that I wi2l search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are se2tled on their l2es: that say in their heart, The LORD wi2l not do g2od, neither wi2l he do evil. 
Therefore their g2ods sha2l become a b2oty, and their houses a desolation: they sha2l also build houses, but not inhabit them; and they sha2l plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof. 
The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man sha2l cry there bi2terly. 
That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distre2s, a day of wastene2s and desolation, a day of darkne2s and gl2omine2s, a day of clouds and thick darkne2s, 
A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers. 
And I wi2l bring distre2s upon men, that they sha2l walk like blind men, because they have si2ned against the LORD: and their bl2od sha2l be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung. 
Neither their silver nor their gold sha2l be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD's wrath; but the whole land sha2l be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he sha2l make even a sp2edy ri2dance of a2l them that dwe2l in the land. 
Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not desired; 
Before the decr2e bring forth, before the day pa2s as the cha2f, before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you, before the day of the LORD's anger come upon you. 
S2ek ye the LORD, a2l ye m2ek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; s2ek righteousne2s, s2ek m2ekne2s: it may be ye sha2l be hid in the day of the LORD's anger. 
For Gaza sha2l be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they sha2l drive out Ashdod at the n2on day, and Ekron sha2l be r2oted up. 
Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O Can2an, the land of the Philistines, I wi2l even destroy th2e, that there sha2l be no inhabitant. 
And the sea coast sha2l be dwe2lings and co2tages for shepherds, and folds for flocks. 
And the coast sha2l be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they sha2l f2ed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon sha2l they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God sha2l visit them, and turn away their captivity. 
I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of A2mon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border. 
Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab sha2l be as Sodom, and the children of A2mon as Gomo2rah, even the br2eding of ne2tles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people sha2l spoil them, and the remnant of my people sha2l po2se2s them. 
This sha2l they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the LORD of hosts. 
The LORD wi2l be te2rible unto them: for he wi2l famish a2l the gods of the earth; and men sha2l worship him, every one from his place, even a2l the isles of the heathen. 
Ye Ethiopians also, ye sha2l be slain by my sword. 
And he wi2l stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy A2syria; and wi2l make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like a wilderne2s. 
And flocks sha2l lie down in the midst of her, a2l the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bi2tern sha2l lodge in the u2per lintels of it; their voice sha2l sing in the windows; desolation sha2l be in the thresholds; for he sha2l uncover the cedar work. 
This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carele2sly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that pa2seth by her sha2l hi2s, and wag his hand. 
Woe to her that is filthy and po2luted, to the o2pre2sing city! 
She obeyed not the voice; she received not co2rection; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God. 
Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones ti2l the mo2row. 
Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have po2luted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law. 
The just LORD is in the midst thereof; he wi2l not do iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame. 
I have cut o2f the nations: their towers are desolate; I made their str2ets waste, that none pa2seth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant. 
I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction; so their dwe2ling should not be cut o2f, howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, and co2rupted a2l their doings. 
Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may a2semble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even a2l my fierce anger: for a2l the earth sha2l be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. 
For then wi2l I turn to the people a pure language, that they may a2l ca2l upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent. 
From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my su2pliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, sha2l bring mine o2fering. 
In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for a2l thy doings, wherein thou hast transgre2sed against me: for then I wi2l take away out of the midst of th2e them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain. 
I wi2l also leave in the midst of th2e an a2flicted and p2or people, and they sha2l trust in the name of the LORD. 
The remnant of Israel sha2l not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither sha2l a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they sha2l f2ed and lie down, and none sha2l make them afraid. 
Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with a2l the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem. 
The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of th2e: thou shalt not s2e evil any more. 
In that day it sha2l be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack. 
The LORD thy God in the midst of th2e is mighty; he wi2l save, he wi2l rejoice over th2e with joy; he wi2l rest in his love, he wi2l joy over th2e with singing. 
I wi2l gather them that are so2rowful for the solemn a2sembly, who are of th2e, to whom the reproach of it was a burden. 
Behold, at that time I wi2l undo a2l that a2flict th2e: and I wi2l save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I wi2l get them praise and fame in every land where they have b2en put to shame. 
At that time wi2l I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you: for I wi2l make you a name and a praise among a2l people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD. 
In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Ha2gai the prophet unto Zeru2babel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying, 
Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the LORD's house should be built. 
Then came the word of the LORD by Ha2gai the prophet, saying, 
Is it time for you, O ye, to dwe2l in your cieled houses, and this house lie waste? 
Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways. 
Ye have sown much, and bring in li2tle; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not fi2led with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes. 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways. 
Go up to the mountain, and bring w2od, and build the house; and I wi2l take pleasure in it, and I wi2l be glorified, saith the LORD. 
Ye l2oked for much, and, lo it came to li2tle; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house. 
Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit. 
And I ca2led for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon ca2tle, and upon a2l the labour of the hands. 
Then Zeru2babel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with a2l the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Ha2gai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD. 
Then spake Ha2gai the LORD's me2senger in the LORD's me2sage unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD. 
And the LORD sti2red up the spirit of Zeru2babel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of a2l the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God, 
In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king. 
In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Ha2gai, saying, 
Speak now to Zeru2babel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying, 
Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye s2e it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing? 
Yet now be strong, O Zeru2babel, saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be strong, a2l ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work: for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts: 
A2cording to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not. 
For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a li2tle while, and I wi2l shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; 
And I wi2l shake a2l nations, and the desire of a2l nations sha2l come: and I wi2l fi2l this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts. 
The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts. 
The glory of this la2ter house sha2l be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place wi2l I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts. 
In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Ha2gai the prophet, saying, 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying, 
If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or po2tage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, sha2l it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No. 
Then said Ha2gai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, sha2l it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It sha2l be unclean. 
Then answered Ha2gai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they o2fer there is unclean. 
And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD: 
Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pre2sfat for to draw out fifty ve2sels out of the pre2s, there were but twenty. 
I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in a2l the labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the LORD. 
Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider it. 
Is the s2ed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tr2e, and the pomegranate, and the olive tr2e, hath not brought forth: from this day wi2l I ble2s you. 
And again the word of the LORD came unto Ha2gai in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying, 
Speak to Zeru2babel, governor of Judah, saying, I wi2l shake the heavens and the earth; 
And I wi2l overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I wi2l destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I wi2l overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders sha2l come down, every one by the sword of his brother. 
In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, wi2l I take th2e, O Zeru2babel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and wi2l make th2e as a signet: for I have chosen th2e, saith the LORD of hosts. 
In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of I2do the prophet, saying, 
The LORD hath b2en sore displeased with your fathers. 
Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I wi2l turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. 
Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD. 
Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever? 
But my words and my statutes, which I co2manded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us, a2cording to our ways, and a2cording to our doings, so hath he dealt with us. 
Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of I2do the prophet, saying, 
I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he st2od among the myrtle tr2es that were in the bo2tom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white. 
Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I wi2l shew th2e what these be. 
And the man that st2od among the myrtle tr2es answered and said, These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth. 
And they answered the angel of the LORD that st2od among the myrtle tr2es, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, a2l the earth si2teth sti2l, and is at rest. 
Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these thr2escore and ten years? 
And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with g2od words and comfortable words. 
So the angel that co2muned with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy. 
And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for I was but a li2tle displeased, and they helped forward the a2fliction. 
Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house sha2l be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line sha2l be stretched forth upon Jerusalem. 
Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity sha2l yet be spread abroad; and the LORD sha2l yet comfort Zion, and sha2l yet ch2ose Jerusalem. 
Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns. 
And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have sca2tered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. 
And the LORD shewed me four carpenters. 
Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which have sca2tered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to sca2ter it. 
I lifted up mine eyes again, and l2oked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to s2e what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof. 
And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to m2et him, 
And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem sha2l be inhabited as towns without wa2ls for the multitude of men and ca2tle therein: 
For I, saith the LORD, wi2l be unto her a wa2l of fire round about, and wi2l be the glory in the midst of her. 
Ho, ho, come forth, and fl2e from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD. 
Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwe2lest with the daughter of Babylon. 
For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the a2ple of his eye. 
For, behold, I wi2l shake mine hand upon them, and they sha2l be a spoil to their servants: and ye sha2l know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me. 
Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I wi2l dwe2l in the midst of th2e, saith the LORD. 
And many nations sha2l be joined to the LORD in that day, and sha2l be my people: and I wi2l dwe2l in the midst of th2e, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto th2e. 
And the LORD sha2l inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and sha2l ch2ose Jerusalem again. 
Be silent, O a2l flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation. 
And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. 
And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke th2e, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke th2e: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire? 
Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and st2od before the angel. 
And he answered and spake unto those that st2od before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pa2s from th2e, and I wi2l clothe th2e with change of raiment. 
And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD st2od by. 
And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying, 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt k2ep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also k2ep my courts, and I wi2l give th2e places to walk among these that stand by. 
Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fe2lows that sit before th2e: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I wi2l bring forth my servant the BRANCH. 
For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone sha2l be seven eyes: behold, I wi2l engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I wi2l remove the iniquity of that land in one day. 
In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, sha2l ye ca2l every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tr2e. 
And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sl2ep. 
And said unto me, What s2est thou? And I said, I have l2oked, and behold a candlestick a2l of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof: 
And two olive tr2es by it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof. 
So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord? 
Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. 
Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto Zeru2babel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts. 
Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zeru2babel thou shalt become a plain: and he sha2l bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it. 
Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
The hands of Zeru2babel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands sha2l also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. 
For who hath despised the day of sma2l things? for they sha2l rejoice, and sha2l s2e the plu2met in the hand of Zeru2babel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth. 
Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive tr2es upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof? 
And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves? 
And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. 
Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD of the whole earth. 
Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and l2oked, and behold a flying ro2l. 
And he said unto me, What s2est thou? And I answered, I s2e a flying ro2l; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits. 
Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth sha2l be cut o2f as on this side a2cording to it; and every one that sweareth sha2l be cut o2f as on that side a2cording to it. 
I wi2l bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it sha2l enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it sha2l remain in the midst of his house, and sha2l consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof. 
Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and s2e what is this that goeth forth. 
And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance through a2l the earth. 
And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a woman that si2teth in the midst of the ephah. 
And he said, This is wickedne2s. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof. 
Then lifted I up mine eyes, and l2oked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah betw2en the earth and the heaven. 
Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah? 
And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it sha2l be established, and set there upon her own base. 
And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and l2oked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from betw2en two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of bra2s. 
In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; 
And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses. 
Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord? 
And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the LORD of a2l the earth. 
The black horses which are therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country. 
And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. 
Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country. 
And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah; 
Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest; 
And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he sha2l grow up out of his place, and he sha2l build the temple of the LORD: 
Even he sha2l build the temple of the LORD; and he sha2l bear the glory, and sha2l sit and rule upon his throne; and he sha2l be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace sha2l be betw2en them both. 
And the crowns sha2l be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD. 
And they that are far o2f sha2l come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye sha2l know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. And this sha2l come to pa2s, if ye wi2l diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God. 
And it came to pa2s in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu; 
When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Rege2melech, and their men, to pray before the LORD, 
And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I w2ep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years? 
Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying, 
Speak unto a2l the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at a2l fast unto me, even to me? 
And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves? 
Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when men inhabited the south and the plain? 
And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying, 
Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compa2sions every man to his brother: 
And o2pre2s not the widow, nor the fatherle2s, the stranger, nor the p2or; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart. 
But they refused to hearken, and pu2led away the shoulder, and sto2ped their ears, that they should not hear. 
Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts. 
Therefore it is come to pa2s, that as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts: 
But I sca2tered them with a whirlwind among a2l the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man pa2sed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate. 
Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury. 
Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and wi2l dwe2l in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem sha2l be ca2led a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain. 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There sha2l yet old men and old women dwe2l in the str2ets of Jerusalem, and every man with his sta2f in his hand for very age. 
And the str2ets of the city sha2l be fu2l of boys and girls playing in the str2ets thereof. 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marve2lous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marve2lous in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts. 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I wi2l save my people from the east country, and from the west country; 
And I wi2l bring them, and they sha2l dwe2l in the midst of Jerusalem: and they sha2l be my people, and I wi2l be their God, in truth and in righteousne2s. 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built. 
For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the a2fliction: for I set a2l men every one against his neighbour. 
But now I wi2l not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days, saith the LORD of hosts. 
For the s2ed sha2l be prosperous; the vine sha2l give her fruit, and the ground sha2l give her increase, and the heavens sha2l give their dew; and I wi2l cause the remnant of this people to po2se2s a2l these things. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so wi2l I save you, and ye sha2l be a ble2sing: fear not, but let your hands be strong. 
For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I repented not: 
So again have I thought in these days to do we2l unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not. 
These are the things that ye sha2l do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates: 
And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for a2l these are things that I hate, saith the LORD. 
And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying, 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, sha2l be to the house of Judah joy and gladne2s, and ch2erful feasts; therefore love the truth and peace. 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It sha2l yet come to pa2s, that there sha2l come people, and the inhabitants of many cities: 
And the inhabitants of one city sha2l go to another, saying, Let us go sp2edily to pray before the LORD, and to s2ek the LORD of hosts: I wi2l go also. 
Yea, many people and strong nations sha2l come to s2ek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD. 
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it sha2l come to pa2s, that ten men sha2l take hold out of a2l languages of the nations, even sha2l take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We wi2l go with you: for we have heard that God is with you. 
The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus sha2l be the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of a2l the tribes of Israel, sha2l be toward the LORD. 
And Hamath also sha2l border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise. 
And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the str2ets. 
Behold, the LORD wi2l cast her out, and he wi2l smite her power in the sea; and she sha2l be devoured with fire. 
Ashkelon sha2l s2e it, and fear; Gaza also sha2l s2e it, and be very so2rowful, and Ekron; for her expectation sha2l be ashamed; and the king sha2l perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon sha2l not be inhabited. 
And a bastard sha2l dwe2l in Ashdod, and I wi2l cut o2f the pride of the Philistines. 
And I wi2l take away his bl2od out of his mouth, and his abominations from betw2en his t2eth: but he that remaineth, even he, sha2l be for our God, and he sha2l be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite. 
And I wi2l encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that pa2seth by, and because of him that returneth: and no o2pre2sor sha2l pa2s through them any more: for now have I s2en with mine eyes. 
Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto th2e: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an a2s, and upon a colt the foal of an a2s. 
And I wi2l cut o2f the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the ba2tle bow sha2l be cut o2f: and he sha2l speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion sha2l be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth. 
As for th2e also, by the bl2od of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water. 
Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare that I wi2l render double unto th2e; 
When I have bent Judah for me, fi2led the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Gr2ece, and made th2e as the sword of a mighty man. 
And the LORD sha2l be s2en over them, and his a2row sha2l go forth as the lightning: and the LORD God sha2l blow the trumpet, and sha2l go with whirlwinds of the south. 
The LORD of hosts sha2l defend them; and they sha2l devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they sha2l drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they sha2l be fi2led like bowls, and as the corners of the altar. 
And the LORD their God sha2l save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they sha2l be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land. 
For how great is his g2odne2s, and how great is his beauty! corn sha2l make the young men ch2erful, and new wine the maids. 
Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the la2ter rain; so the LORD sha2l make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one gra2s in the field. 
For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have s2en a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no shepherd. 
Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his g2odly horse in the ba2tle. 
Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the ba2tle bow, out of him every o2pre2sor together. 
And they sha2l be as mighty men, which tread down their enemies in the mire of the str2ets in the ba2tle: and they sha2l fight, because the LORD is with them, and the riders on horses sha2l be confounded. 
And I wi2l strengthen the house of Judah, and I wi2l save the house of Joseph, and I wi2l bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they sha2l be as though I had not cast them o2f: for I am the LORD their God, and wi2l hear them. 
And they of Ephraim sha2l be like a mighty man, and their heart sha2l rejoice as through wine: yea, their children sha2l s2e it, and be glad; their heart sha2l rejoice in the LORD. 
I wi2l hi2s for them, and gather them; for I have red2emed them: and they sha2l increase as they have increased. 
And I wi2l sow them among the people: and they sha2l remember me in far countries; and they sha2l live with their children, and turn again. 
I wi2l bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of A2syria; and I wi2l bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place sha2l not be found for them. 
And he sha2l pa2s through the sea with a2fliction, and sha2l smite the waves in the sea, and a2l the d2eps of the river sha2l dry up: and the pride of A2syria sha2l be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt sha2l depart away. 
And I wi2l strengthen them in the LORD; and they sha2l walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD. 
Open thy d2ors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars. 
Howl, fir tr2e; for the cedar is fa2len; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down. 
There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled. 
Thus saith the LORD my God; F2ed the flock of the slaughter; 
Whose po2se2sors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that se2l them say, Ble2sed be the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not. 
For I wi2l no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I wi2l deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they sha2l smite the land, and out of their hand I wi2l not deliver them. 
And I wi2l f2ed the flock of slaughter, even you, O p2or of the flock. And I t2ok unto me two staves; the one I ca2led Beauty, and the other I ca2led Bands; and I fed the flock. 
Thr2e shepherds also I cut o2f in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abho2red me. 
Then said I, I wi2l not f2ed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut o2f, let it be cut o2f; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another. 
And I t2ok my sta2f, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with a2l the people. 
And it was broken in that day: and so the p2or of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD. 
And I said unto them, If ye think g2od, give me my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. 
And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the po2ter: a g2odly price that I was prised at of them. And I t2ok the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the po2ter in the house of the LORD. 
Then I cut asunder mine other sta2f, even Bands, that I might break the brotherh2od betw2en Judah and Israel. 
And the LORD said unto me, Take unto th2e yet the instruments of a f2olish shepherd. 
For, lo, I wi2l raise up a shepherd in the land, which sha2l not visit those that be cut o2f, neither sha2l s2ek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor f2ed that that standeth sti2l: but he sha2l eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces. 
Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword sha2l be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm sha2l be clean dried up, and his right eye sha2l be u2terly darkened. 
The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him. 
Behold, I wi2l make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto a2l the people round about, when they sha2l be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem. 
And in that day wi2l I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for a2l people: a2l that burden themselves with it sha2l be cut in pieces, though a2l the people of the earth be gathered together against it. 
In that day, saith the LORD, I wi2l smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madne2s: and I wi2l open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and wi2l smite every horse of the people with blindne2s. 
And the governors of Judah sha2l say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem sha2l be my strength in the LORD of hosts their God. 
In that day wi2l I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the w2od, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they sha2l devour a2l the people round about, on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem sha2l be inhabited again in her own place, even in Jerusalem. 
The LORD also sha2l save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah. 
In that day sha2l the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is f2eble among them at that day sha2l be as David; and the house of David sha2l be as God, as the angel of the LORD before them. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, that I wi2l s2ek to destroy a2l the nations that come against Jerusalem. 
And I wi2l pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of su2plications: and they sha2l l2ok upon me whom they have pierced, and they sha2l mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and sha2l be in bi2terne2s for him, as one that is in bi2terne2s for his firstborn. 
In that day sha2l there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadri2mon in the va2ley of Megi2don. 
And the land sha2l mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart; 
The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart; 
A2l the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart. 
In that day there sha2l be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for unclea2ne2s. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I wi2l cut o2f the names of the idols out of the land, and they sha2l no more be remembered: and also I wi2l cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pa2s out of the land. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that when any sha2l yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him sha2l say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him sha2l thrust him through when he prophesieth. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, that the prophets sha2l be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither sha2l they wear a rough garment to deceive: 
But he sha2l say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman; for man taught me to k2ep ca2tle from my youth. 
And one sha2l say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then he sha2l answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends. 
Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fe2low, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sh2ep sha2l be sca2tered: and I wi2l turn mine hand upon the li2tle ones. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that in a2l the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein sha2l be cut o2f and die; but the third sha2l be left therein. 
And I wi2l bring the third part through the fire, and wi2l refine them as silver is refined, and wi2l try them as gold is tried: they sha2l ca2l on my name, and I wi2l hear them: I wi2l say, It is my people: and they sha2l say, The LORD is my God. 
Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil sha2l be divided in the midst of th2e. 
For I wi2l gather a2l nations against Jerusalem to ba2tle; and the city sha2l be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city sha2l go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people sha2l not be cut o2f from the city. 
Then sha2l the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of ba2tle. 
And his f2et sha2l stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives sha2l cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there sha2l be a very great va2ley; and half of the mountain sha2l remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south. 
And ye sha2l fl2e to the va2ley of the mountains; for the va2ley of the mountains sha2l reach unto Azal: yea, ye sha2l fl2e, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of U2ziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God sha2l come, and a2l the saints with th2e. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, that the light sha2l not be clear, nor dark: 
But it sha2l be one day which sha2l be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it sha2l come to pa2s, that at evening time it sha2l be light. 
And it sha2l be in that day, that living waters sha2l go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in su2mer and in winter sha2l it be. 
And the LORD sha2l be king over a2l the earth: in that day sha2l there be one LORD, and his name one. 
A2l the land sha2l be turned as a plain from Geba to Ri2mon south of Jerusalem: and it sha2l be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hanan2el unto the king's winepre2ses. 
And men sha2l dwe2l in it, and there sha2l be no more u2ter destruction; but Jerusalem sha2l be safely inhabited. 
And this sha2l be the plague wherewith the LORD wi2l smite a2l the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh sha2l consume away while they stand upon their f2et, and their eyes sha2l consume away in their holes, and their tongue sha2l consume away in their mouth. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in that day, that a great tumult from the LORD sha2l be among them; and they sha2l lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand sha2l rise up against the hand of his neighbour. 
And Judah also sha2l fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of a2l the heathen round about sha2l be gathered together, gold, and silver, and a2parel, in great abundance. 
And so sha2l be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the a2s, and of a2l the beasts that sha2l be in these tents, as this plague. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that every one that is left of a2l the nations which came against Jerusalem sha2l even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to k2ep the feast of tabernacles. 
And it sha2l be, that whoso wi2l not come up of a2l the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, even upon them sha2l be no rain. 
And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no rain; there sha2l be the plague, wherewith the LORD wi2l smite the heathen that come not up to k2ep the feast of tabernacles. 
This sha2l be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of a2l nations that come not up to k2ep the feast of tabernacles. 
In that day sha2l there be upon the be2ls of the horses, HOLINE2S UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD's house sha2l be like the bowls before the altar. 
Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah sha2l be holine2s unto the LORD of hosts: and a2l they that sacrifice sha2l come and take of them, and s2ethe therein: and in that day there sha2l be no more the Can2anite in the house of the LORD of hosts. 
The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi. 
I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob, 
And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderne2s. 
Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we wi2l return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They sha2l build, but I wi2l throw down; and they sha2l ca2l them, The border of wickedne2s, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever. 
And your eyes sha2l s2e, and ye sha2l say, The LORD wi2l be magnified from the border of Israel. 
A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name? 
Ye o2fer po2luted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we po2luted th2e? In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible. 
And if ye o2fer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye o2fer the lame and sick, is it not evil? o2fer it now unto thy governor; wi2l he be pleased with th2e, or a2cept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts. 
And now, I pray you, bes2ech God that he wi2l be gracious unto us: this hath b2en by your means: wi2l he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts. 
Who is there even among you that would shut the d2ors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither wi2l I a2cept an o2fering at your hand. 
For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name sha2l be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense sha2l be o2fered unto my name, and a pure o2fering: for my name sha2l be great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts. 
But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD is po2luted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible. 
Ye said also, Behold, what a wearine2s is it! and ye have snu2fed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an o2fering: should I a2cept this of your hand? saith the LORD. 
But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a co2rupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen. 
And now, O ye priests, this co2mandment is for you. 
If ye wi2l not hear, and if ye wi2l not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I wi2l even send a curse upon you, and I wi2l curse your ble2sings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart. 
Behold, I wi2l co2rupt your s2ed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one sha2l take you away with it. 
And ye sha2l know that I have sent this co2mandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts. 
My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name. 
The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity. 
For the priest's lips should k2ep knowledge, and they should s2ek the law at his mouth: for he is the me2senger of the LORD of hosts. 
But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have co2rupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts. 
Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before a2l the people, a2cording as ye have not kept my ways, but have b2en partial in the law. 
Have we not a2l one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers? 
Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is co2mi2ted in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holine2s of the LORD which he loved, and hath ma2ried the daughter of a strange god. 
The LORD wi2l cut o2f the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that o2fereth an o2fering unto the LORD of hosts. 
And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with w2eping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the o2fering any more, or receiveth it with g2od wi2l at your hand. 
Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath b2en witne2s betw2en th2e and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant. 
And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might s2ek a godly s2ed. Therefore take h2ed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth. 
For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth pu2ting away: for one covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD of hosts: therefore take h2ed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously. 
Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is g2od in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgment? 
Behold, I wi2l send my me2senger, and he sha2l prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom ye s2ek, sha2l su2denly come to his temple, even the me2senger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he sha2l come, saith the LORD of hosts. 
But who may abide the day of his coming? and who sha2l stand when he a2peareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fu2lers' soap: 
And he sha2l sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he sha2l purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may o2fer unto the LORD an o2fering in righteousne2s. 
Then sha2l the o2fering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years. 
And I wi2l come near to you to judgment; and I wi2l be a swift witne2s against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that o2pre2s the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherle2s, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts. 
For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed. 
Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I wi2l return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein sha2l we return? 
Wi2l a man rob God? Yet ye have ro2bed me. But ye say, Wherein have we ro2bed th2e? In tithes and o2ferings. 
Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have ro2bed me, even this whole nation. 
Bring ye a2l the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I wi2l not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a ble2sing, that there sha2l not be r2om enough to receive it. 
And I wi2l rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he sha2l not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither sha2l your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts. 
And a2l nations sha2l ca2l you ble2sed: for ye sha2l be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts. 
Your words have b2en stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against th2e? 
Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfu2ly before the LORD of hosts? 
And now we ca2l the proud ha2py; yea, they that work wickedne2s are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered. 
Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a b2ok of remembrance was wri2ten before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name. 
And they sha2l be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I wi2l spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him. 
Then sha2l ye return, and discern betw2en the righteous and the wicked, betw2en him that serveth God and him that serveth him not. 
For, behold, the day cometh, that sha2l burn as an oven; and a2l the proud, yea, and a2l that do wickedly, sha2l be stu2ble: and the day that cometh sha2l burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it sha2l leave them neither r2ot nor branch. 
But unto you that fear my name sha2l the Sun of righteousne2s arise with healing in his wings; and ye sha2l go forth, and grow up as calves of the sta2l. 
And ye sha2l tread down the wicked; for they sha2l be ashes under the soles of your f2et in the day that I sha2l do this, saith the LORD of hosts. 
Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I co2manded unto him in Horeb for a2l Israel, with the statutes and judgments. 
Behold, I wi2l send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD: 
And he sha2l turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. 
The b2ok of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. 
Abraham begat Is2ac; and Is2ac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren; 
And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram; 
And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat N2a2son; and N2a2son begat Salmon; 
And Salmon begat B2oz of Rachab; and B2oz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Je2se; 
And Je2se begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had b2en the wife of Urias; 
And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; 
And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias; 
And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias; 
And Ezekias begat Mana2ses; and Mana2ses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias; 
And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were ca2ried away to Babylon: 
And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel; 
And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; 
And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; 
And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Ma2than; and Ma2than begat Jacob; 
And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is ca2led Christ. 
So a2l the generations from Abraham to David are fourt2en generations; and from David until the ca2rying away into Babylon are fourt2en generations; and from the ca2rying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourt2en generations. 
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. 
Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wi2ling to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily. 
But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD a2peared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto th2e Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. 
And she sha2l bring forth a son, and thou shalt ca2l his name JESUS: for he sha2l save his people from their sins. 
Now a2l this was done, that it might be fulfi2led which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, 
Behold, a virgin sha2l be with child, and sha2l bring forth a son, and they sha2l ca2l his name E2manuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. 
Then Joseph being raised from sl2ep did as the angel of the Lord had bi2den him, and t2ok unto him his wife: 
And knew her not ti2l she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he ca2led his name JESUS. 
Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, 
Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have s2en his star in the east, and are come to worship him. 
When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and a2l Jerusalem with him. 
And when he had gathered a2l the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. 
And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is wri2ten by the prophet, 
And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of th2e sha2l come a Governor, that sha2l rule my people Israel. 
Then Herod, when he had privily ca2led the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star a2peared. 
And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also. 
When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, ti2l it came and st2od over where the young child was. 
When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exc2eding great joy. 
And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fe2l down, and worshi2ped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and my2rh. 
And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. 
And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord a2peareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and fl2e into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring th2e word: for Herod wi2l s2ek the young child to destroy him. 
When he arose, he t2ok the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: 
And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfi2led which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I ca2led my son. 
Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exc2eding wroth, and sent forth, and slew a2l the children that were in Bethlehem, and in a2l the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, a2cording to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men. 
Then was fulfi2led that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, 
In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and w2eping, and great mourning, Rachel w2eping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not. 
But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord a2peareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, 
Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life. 
And he arose, and t2ok the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. 
But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the r2om of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galil2e: 
And he came and dwelt in a city ca2led Nazareth: that it might be fulfi2led which was spoken by the prophets, He sha2l be ca2led a Nazarene. 
In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderne2s of Judaea, 
And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. 
For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderne2s, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. 
And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey. 
Then went out to him Jerusalem, and a2l Judaea, and a2l the region round about Jordan, 
And were baptized of him in Jordan, confe2sing their sins. 
But when he saw many of the Pharis2es and Sa2duc2es come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to fl2e from the wrath to come? 
Bring forth therefore fruits m2et for repentance: 
And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. 
And now also the axe is laid unto the r2ot of the tr2es: therefore every tr2e which bringeth not forth g2od fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. 
I ind2ed baptize you with water unto repentance. but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he sha2l baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire: 
Whose fan is in his hand, and he wi2l throughly purge his fl2or, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he wi2l burn up the cha2f with unquenchable fire. 
Then cometh Jesus from Galil2e to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. 
But John forbad him, saying, I have n2ed to be baptized of th2e, and comest thou to me? 
And Jesus answering said unto him, Su2fer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil a2l righteousne2s. Then he su2fered him. 
And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: 
And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am we2l pleased. 
Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderne2s to be tempted of the devil. 
And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred. 
And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, co2mand that these stones be made bread. 
But he answered and said, It is wri2ten, Man sha2l not live by bread alone, but by every word that proc2edeth out of the mouth of God. 
Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and se2teth him on a pi2nacle of the temple, 
And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is wri2ten, He sha2l give his angels charge concerning th2e: and in their hands they sha2l bear th2e up, lest at any time thou dash thy f2ot against a stone. 
Jesus said unto him, It is wri2ten again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. 
Again, the devil taketh him up into an exc2eding high mountain, and sheweth him a2l the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; 
And saith unto him, A2l these things wi2l I give th2e, if thou wilt fa2l down and worship me. 
Then saith Jesus unto him, Get th2e hence, Satan: for it is wri2ten, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. 
Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him. 
Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galil2e; 
And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim: 
That it might be fulfi2led which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, 
The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galil2e of the Gentiles; 
The people which sat in darkne2s saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up. 
From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. 
And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galil2e, saw two brethren, Simon ca2led Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. 
And he saith unto them, Fo2low me, and I wi2l make you fishers of men. 
And they straightway left their nets, and fo2lowed him. 
And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebed2e, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebed2e their father, mending their nets; and he ca2led them. 
And they i2mediately left the ship and their father, and fo2lowed him. 
And Jesus went about a2l Galil2e, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing a2l ma2ner of sickne2s and a2l ma2ner of disease among the people. 
And his fame went throughout a2l Syria: and they brought unto him a2l sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were po2se2sed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them. 
And there fo2lowed him great multitudes of people from Galil2e, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan. 
And s2eing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him: 
And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, 
Ble2sed are the p2or in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
Ble2sed are they that mourn: for they sha2l be comforted. 
Ble2sed are the m2ek: for they sha2l inherit the earth. 
Ble2sed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousne2s: for they sha2l be fi2led. 
Ble2sed are the merciful: for they sha2l obtain mercy. 
Ble2sed are the pure in heart: for they sha2l s2e God. 
Ble2sed are the peacemakers: for they sha2l be ca2led the children of God. 
Ble2sed are they which are persecuted for righteousne2s' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
Ble2sed are ye, when men sha2l revile you, and persecute you, and sha2l say a2l ma2ner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. 
Rejoice, and be exc2eding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. 
Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith sha2l it be salted? it is thenceforth g2od for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be tro2den under f2ot of men. 
Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hi2l ca2not be hid. 
Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto a2l that are in the house. 
Let your light so shine before men, that they may s2e your g2od works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. 
Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 
For verily I say unto you, Ti2l heaven and earth pa2s, one jot or one ti2tle sha2l in no wise pa2s from the law, ti2l a2l be fulfi2led. 
Whosoever therefore sha2l break one of these least co2mandments, and sha2l teach men so, he sha2l be ca2led the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever sha2l do and teach them, the same sha2l be ca2led great in the kingdom of heaven. 
For I say unto you, That except your righteousne2s sha2l exc2ed the righteousne2s of the scribes and Pharis2es, ye sha2l in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. 
Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not ki2l; and whosoever sha2l ki2l sha2l be in danger of the judgment: 
But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause sha2l be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever sha2l say to his brother, Raca, sha2l be in danger of the council: but whosoever sha2l say, Thou f2ol, sha2l be in danger of he2l fire. 
Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against th2e; 
Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and o2fer thy gift. 
Agr2e with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver th2e to the judge, and the judge deliver th2e to the o2ficer, and thou be cast into prison. 
Verily I say unto th2e, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, ti2l thou hast paid the u2termost farthing. 
Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not co2mit adultery: 
But I say unto you, That whosoever l2oketh on a woman to lust after her hath co2mi2ted adultery with her already in his heart. 
And if thy right eye o2fend th2e, pluck it out, and cast it from th2e: for it is profitable for th2e that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into he2l. 
And if thy right hand o2fend th2e, cut it o2f, and cast it from th2e: for it is profitable for th2e that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into he2l. 
It hath b2en said, Whosoever sha2l put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: 
But I say unto you, That whosoever sha2l put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to co2mit adultery: and whosoever sha2l ma2ry her that is divorced co2mi2teth adultery. 
Again, ye have heard that it hath b2en said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: 
But I say unto you, Swear not at a2l; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: 
Nor by the earth; for it is his f2otst2ol: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. 
Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. 
But let your co2munication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. 
Ye have heard that it hath b2en said, An eye for an eye, and a t2oth for a t2oth: 
But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever sha2l smite th2e on thy right ch2ek, turn to him the other also. 
And if any man wi2l sue th2e at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. 
And whosoever sha2l compel th2e to go a mile, go with him twain. 
Give to him that asketh th2e, and from him that would bo2row of th2e turn not thou away. 
Ye have heard that it hath b2en said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. 
But I say unto you, Love your enemies, ble2s them that curse you, do g2od to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefu2ly use you, and persecute you; 
That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the g2od, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. 
For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? 
And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so? 
Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. 
Take h2ed that ye do not your alms before men, to be s2en of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. 
Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before th2e, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the str2ets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 
But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: 
That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which s2eth in secret himself sha2l reward th2e openly. 
And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the str2ets, that they may be s2en of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 
But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy d2or, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which s2eth in secret sha2l reward th2e openly. 
But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they sha2l be heard for their much speaking. 
Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have n2ed of, before ye ask him. 
After this ma2ner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Ha2lowed be thy name. 
Thy kingdom come, Thy wi2l be done in earth, as it is in heaven. 
Give us this day our daily bread. 
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. 
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. 
For if ye forgive men their trespa2ses, your heavenly Father wi2l also forgive you: 
But if ye forgive not men their trespa2ses, neither wi2l your Father forgive your trespa2ses. 
Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may a2pear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. 
But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; 
That thou a2pear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which s2eth in secret, sha2l reward th2e openly. 
Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth co2rupt, and where thieves break through and steal: 
But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth co2rupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: 
For where your treasure is, there wi2l your heart be also. 
The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body sha2l be fu2l of light. 
But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body sha2l be fu2l of darkne2s. If therefore the light that is in th2e be darkne2s, how great is that darkne2s! 
No man can serve two masters: for either he wi2l hate the one, and love the other; or else he wi2l hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye ca2not serve God and ma2mon. 
Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye sha2l eat, or what ye sha2l drink; nor yet for your body, what ye sha2l put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? 
Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father f2edeth them. Are ye not much be2ter than they? 
Which of you by taking thought can a2d one cubit unto his stature? 
And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: 
And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in a2l his glory was not a2rayed like one of these. 
Wherefore, if God so clothe the gra2s of the field, which to day is, and to mo2row is cast into the oven, sha2l he not much more clothe you, O ye of li2tle faith? 
Therefore take no thought, saying, What sha2l we eat? or, What sha2l we drink? or, Wherewithal sha2l we be clothed? 
(For after a2l these things do the Gentiles s2ek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have n2ed of a2l these things. 
But s2ek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousne2s; and a2l these things sha2l be a2ded unto you. 
Take therefore no thought for the mo2row: for the mo2row sha2l take thought for the things of itself. Su2ficient unto the day is the evil thereof. 
Judge not, that ye be not judged. 
For with what judgment ye judge, ye sha2l be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it sha2l be measured to you again. 
And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? 
Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pu2l out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? 
Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou s2e clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye. 
Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their f2et, and turn again and rend you. 
Ask, and it sha2l be given you; s2ek, and ye sha2l find; knock, and it sha2l be opened unto you: 
For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that s2eketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it sha2l be opened. 
Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, wi2l he give him a stone? 
Or if he ask a fish, wi2l he give him a serpent? 
If ye then, being evil, know how to give g2od gifts unto your children, how much more sha2l your Father which is in heaven give g2od things to them that ask him? 
Therefore a2l things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets. 
Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: 
Because strait is the gate, and na2row is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. 
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sh2ep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. 
Ye sha2l know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? 
Even so every g2od tr2e bringeth forth g2od fruit; but a co2rupt tr2e bringeth forth evil fruit. 
A g2od tr2e ca2not bring forth evil fruit, neither can a co2rupt tr2e bring forth g2od fruit. 
Every tr2e that bringeth not forth g2od fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. 
Wherefore by their fruits ye sha2l know them. 
Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, sha2l enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the wi2l of my Father which is in heaven. 
Many wi2l say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? 
And then wi2l I profe2s unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. 
Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I wi2l liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: 
And the rain descended, and the fl2ods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fe2l not: for it was founded upon a rock. 
And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, sha2l be likened unto a f2olish man, which built his house upon the sand: 
And the rain descended, and the fl2ods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fe2l: and great was the fa2l of it. 
And it came to pa2s, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine: 
For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes. 
When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes fo2lowed him. 
And, behold, there came a leper and worshi2ped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 
And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I wi2l; be thou clean. And i2mediately his leprosy was cleansed. 
And Jesus saith unto him, S2e thou te2l no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and o2fer the gift that Moses co2manded, for a testimony unto them. 
And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, bes2eching him, 
And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented. 
And Jesus saith unto him, I wi2l come and heal him. 
The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my r2of: but speak the word only, and my servant sha2l be healed. 
For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. 
When Jesus heard it, he marve2led, and said to them that fo2lowed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. 
And I say unto you, That many sha2l come from the east and west, and sha2l sit down with Abraham, and Is2ac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. 
But the children of the kingdom sha2l be cast out into outer darkne2s: there sha2l be w2eping and gnashing of t2eth. 
And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto th2e. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour. 
And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever. 
And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them. 
When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were po2se2sed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed a2l that were sick: 
That it might be fulfi2led which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself t2ok our infirmities, and bare our sickne2ses. 
Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave co2mandment to depart unto the other side. 
And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I wi2l fo2low th2e whithersoever thou goest. 
And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. 
And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, su2fer me first to go and bury my father. 
But Jesus said unto him, Fo2low me; and let the dead bury their dead. 
And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples fo2lowed him. 
And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asl2ep. 
And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish. 
And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of li2tle faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm. 
But the men marve2led, saying, What ma2ner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him! 
And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two po2se2sed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exc2eding fierce, so that no man might pa2s by that way. 
And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with th2e, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time? 
And there was a g2od way o2f from them an herd of many swine f2eding. 
So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, su2fer us to go away into the herd of swine. 
And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a st2ep place into the sea, and perished in the waters. 
And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befa2len to the po2se2sed of the devils. 
And, behold, the whole city came out to m2et Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts. 
And he entered into a ship, and pa2sed over, and came into his own city. 
And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus s2eing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of g2od ch2er; thy sins be forgiven th2e. 
And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth. 
And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? 
For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven th2e; or to say, Arise, and walk? 
But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house. 
And he arose, and departed to his house. 
But when the multitudes saw it, they marve2led, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men. 
And as Jesus pa2sed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Ma2thew, si2ting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Fo2low me. And he arose, and fo2lowed him. 
And it came to pa2s, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and si2ners came and sat down with him and his disciples. 
And when the Pharis2es saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and si2ners? 
But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole n2ed not a physician, but they that are sick. 
But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I wi2l have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to ca2l the righteous, but si2ners to repentance. 
Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharis2es fast oft, but thy disciples fast not? 
And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegr2om is with them? but the days wi2l come, when the bridegr2om sha2l be taken from them, and then sha2l they fast. 
No man pu2teth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fi2l it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse. 
Neither do men put new wine into old bo2tles: else the bo2tles break, and the wine ru2neth out, and the bo2tles perish: but they put new wine into new bo2tles, and both are preserved. 
While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshi2ped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she sha2l live. 
And Jesus arose, and fo2lowed him, and so did his disciples. 
And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an i2sue of bl2od twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment: 
For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I sha2l be whole. 
But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of g2od comfort; thy faith hath made th2e whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour. 
And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise, 
He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sl2epeth. And they laughed him to scorn. 
But when the people were put forth, he went in, and t2ok her by the hand, and the maid arose. 
And the fame hereof went abroad into a2l that land. 
And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men fo2lowed him, crying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us. 
And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord. 
Then touched he their eyes, saying, A2cording to your faith be it unto you. 
And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, S2e that no man know it. 
But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in a2l that country. 
As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man po2se2sed with a devil. 
And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marve2led, saying, It was never so s2en in Israel. 
But the Pharis2es said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils. 
And Jesus went about a2l the cities and vi2lages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickne2s and every disease among the people. 
But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compa2sion on them, because they fainted, and were sca2tered abroad, as sh2ep having no shepherd. 
Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; 
Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he wi2l send forth labourers into his harvest. 
And when he had ca2led unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal a2l ma2ner of sickne2s and a2l ma2ner of disease. 
Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is ca2led Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebed2e, and John his brother; 
Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Ma2thew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Le2baeus, whose surname was Tha2daeus; 
Simon the Can2anite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. 
These twelve Jesus sent forth, and co2manded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: 
But go rather to the lost sh2ep of the house of Israel. 
And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. 
Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: fr2ely ye have received, fr2ely give. 
Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor bra2s in your purses, 
Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat. 
And into whatsoever city or town ye sha2l enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide ti2l ye go thence. 
And when ye come into an house, salute it. 
And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you. 
And whosoever sha2l not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake o2f the dust of your f2et. 
Verily I say unto you, It sha2l be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomo2rha in the day of judgment, than for that city. 
Behold, I send you forth as sh2ep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmle2s as doves. 
But beware of men: for they wi2l deliver you up to the councils, and they wi2l scourge you in their synagogues; 
And ye sha2l be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles. 
But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye sha2l speak: for it sha2l be given you in that same hour what ye sha2l speak. 
For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you. 
And the brother sha2l deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children sha2l rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death. 
And ye sha2l be hated of a2l men for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end sha2l be saved. 
But when they persecute you in this city, fl2e ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye sha2l not have gone over the cities of Israel, ti2l the Son of man be come. 
The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord. 
It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have ca2led the master of the house B2elzebub, how much more sha2l they ca2l them of his household? 
Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that sha2l not be revealed; and hid, that sha2l not be known. 
What I te2l you in darkne2s, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops. 
And fear not them which ki2l the body, but are not able to ki2l the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in he2l. 
Are not two spa2rows sold for a farthing? and one of them sha2l not fa2l on the ground without your Father. 
But the very hairs of your head are a2l numbered. 
Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many spa2rows. 
Whosoever therefore sha2l confe2s me before men, him wi2l I confe2s also before my Father which is in heaven. 
But whosoever sha2l deny me before men, him wi2l I also deny before my Father which is in heaven. 
Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. 
For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. 
And a man's foes sha2l be they of his own household. 
He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. 
And he that taketh not his cro2s, and fo2loweth after me, is not worthy of me. 
He that findeth his life sha2l lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake sha2l find it. 
He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. 
He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet sha2l receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man sha2l receive a righteous man's reward. 
And whosoever sha2l give to drink unto one of these li2tle ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he sha2l in no wise lose his reward. 
And it came to pa2s, when Jesus had made an end of co2manding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities. 
Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, 
And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we l2ok for another? 
Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and s2e: 
The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the p2or have the gospel preached to them. 
And ble2sed is he, whosoever sha2l not be o2fended in me. 
And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderne2s to s2e? A r2ed shaken with the wind? 
But what went ye out for to s2e? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. 
But what went ye out for to s2e? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet. 
For this is he, of whom it is wri2ten, Behold, I send my me2senger before thy face, which sha2l prepare thy way before th2e. 
Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 
And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven su2fereth violence, and the violent take it by force. 
For a2l the prophets and the law prophesied until John. 
And if ye wi2l receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come. 
He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
But whereunto sha2l I liken this generation? It is like unto children si2ting in the markets, and ca2ling unto their fe2lows, 
And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented. 
For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil. 
The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man glu2tonous, and a winebi2ber, a friend of publicans and si2ners. But wisdom is justified of her children. 
Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not: 
Woe unto th2e, Chorazin! woe unto th2e, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had b2en done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 
But I say unto you, It sha2l be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you. 
And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to he2l: for if the mighty works, which have b2en done in th2e, had b2en done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. 
But I say unto you, That it sha2l be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for th2e. 
At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank th2e, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. 
Even so, Father: for so it s2emed g2od in thy sight. 
A2l things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son wi2l reveal him. 
Come unto me, a2l ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I wi2l give you rest. 
Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am m2ek and lowly in heart: and ye sha2l find rest unto your souls. 
For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. 
At that time Jesus went on the sa2bath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat. 
But when the Pharis2es saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sa2bath day. 
But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him; 
How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests? 
Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sa2bath days the priests in the temple profane the sa2bath, and are blamele2s? 
But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple. 
But if ye had known what this meaneth, I wi2l have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltle2s. 
For the Son of man is Lord even of the sa2bath day. 
And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue: 
And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sa2bath days? that they might a2cuse him. 
And he said unto them, What man sha2l there be among you, that sha2l have one sh2ep, and if it fa2l into a pit on the sa2bath day, wi2l he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? 
How much then is a man be2ter than a sh2ep? Wherefore it is lawful to do we2l on the sa2bath days. 
Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other. 
Then the Pharis2es went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him. 
But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes fo2lowed him, and he healed them a2l; 
And charged them that they should not make him known: 
That it might be fulfi2led which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, 
Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is we2l pleased: I wi2l put my spirit upon him, and he sha2l shew judgment to the Gentiles. 
He sha2l not strive, nor cry; neither sha2l any man hear his voice in the str2ets. 
A bruised r2ed sha2l he not break, and smoking flax sha2l he not quench, ti2l he send forth judgment unto victory. 
And in his name sha2l the Gentiles trust. 
Then was brought unto him one po2se2sed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw. 
And a2l the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David? 
But when the Pharis2es heard it, they said, This fe2low doth not cast out devils, but by B2elzebub the prince of the devils. 
And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself sha2l not stand: 
And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how sha2l then his kingdom stand? 
And if I by B2elzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they sha2l be your judges. 
But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you. 
Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his g2ods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he wi2l spoil his house. 
He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me sca2tereth abroad. 
Wherefore I say unto you, A2l ma2ner of sin and blasphemy sha2l be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost sha2l not be forgiven unto men. 
And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it sha2l be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it sha2l not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come. 
Either make the tr2e g2od, and his fruit g2od; or else make the tr2e co2rupt, and his fruit co2rupt: for the tr2e is known by his fruit. 
O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak g2od things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. 
A g2od man out of the g2od treasure of the heart bringeth forth g2od things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. 
But I say unto you, That every idle word that men sha2l speak, they sha2l give a2count thereof in the day of judgment. 
For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. 
Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharis2es answered, saying, Master, we would s2e a sign from th2e. 
But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation s2eketh after a sign; and there sha2l no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas: 
For as Jonas was thr2e days and thr2e nights in the whale's be2ly; so sha2l the Son of man be thr2e days and thr2e nights in the heart of the earth. 
The men of Nineveh sha2l rise in judgment with this generation, and sha2l condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here. 
The qu2en of the south sha2l rise up in the judgment with this generation, and sha2l condemn it: for she came from the u2termost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here. 
When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, s2eking rest, and findeth none. 
Then he saith, I wi2l return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. 
Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwe2l there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so sha2l it be also unto this wicked generation. 
While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren st2od without, desiring to speak with him. 
Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with th2e. 
But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? 
And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! 
For whosoever sha2l do the wi2l of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother. 
The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side. 
And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude st2od on the shore. 
And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow; 
And when he sowed, some s2eds fe2l by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up: 
Some fe2l upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no d2epne2s of earth: 
And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no r2ot, they withered away. 
And some fe2l among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them: 
But other fe2l into g2od ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold. 
Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? 
He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. 
For whosoever hath, to him sha2l be given, and he sha2l have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him sha2l be taken away even that he hath. 
Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they s2eing s2e not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand. 
And in them is fulfi2led the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye sha2l hear, and sha2l not understand; and s2eing ye sha2l s2e, and sha2l not perceive: 
For this people's heart is waxed gro2s, and their ears are du2l of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should s2e with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. 
But ble2sed are your eyes, for they s2e: and your ears, for they hear. 
For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to s2e those things which ye s2e, and have not s2en them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them. 
Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. 
When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received s2ed by the way side. 
But he that received the s2ed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; 
Yet hath he not r2ot in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is o2fended. 
He also that received s2ed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulne2s of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. 
But he that received s2ed into the g2od ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. 
Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed g2od s2ed in his field: 
But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. 
But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then a2peared the tares also. 
So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow g2od s2ed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? 
He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 
But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye r2ot up also the wheat with them. 
Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I wi2l say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. 
Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard s2ed, which a man t2ok, and sowed in his field: 
Which ind2ed is the least of a2l s2eds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tr2e, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. 
Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman t2ok, and hid in thr2e measures of meal, ti2l the whole was leavened. 
A2l these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them: 
That it might be fulfi2led which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I wi2l open my mouth in parables; I wi2l u2ter things which have b2en kept secret from the foundation of the world. 
Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. 
He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the g2od s2ed is the Son of man; 
The field is the world; the g2od s2ed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; 
The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. 
As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so sha2l it be in the end of this world. 
The Son of man sha2l send forth his angels, and they sha2l gather out of his kingdom a2l things that o2fend, and them which do iniquity; 
And sha2l cast them into a furnace of fire: there sha2l be wailing and gnashing of t2eth. 
Then sha2l the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and se2leth a2l that he hath, and buyeth that field. 
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, s2eking g2odly pearls: 
Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold a2l that he had, and bought it. 
Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: 
Which, when it was fu2l, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the g2od into ve2sels, but cast the bad away. 
So sha2l it be at the end of the world: the angels sha2l come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, 
And sha2l cast them into the furnace of fire: there sha2l be wailing and gnashing of t2eth. 
Jesus saith unto them, Have ye underst2od a2l these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord. 
Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old. 
And it came to pa2s, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence. 
And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works? 
Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother ca2led Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? 
And his sisters, are they not a2l with us? Whence then hath this man a2l these things? 
And they were o2fended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house. 
And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief. 
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, 
And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him. 
For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife. 
For John said unto him, It is not lawful for th2e to have her. 
And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet. 
But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod. 
Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask. 
And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger. 
And the king was so2ry: neverthele2s for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he co2manded it to be given her. 
And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison. 
And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother. 
And his disciples came, and t2ok up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus. 
When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they fo2lowed him on f2ot out of the cities. 
And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compa2sion toward them, and he healed their sick. 
And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the vi2lages, and buy themselves victuals. 
But Jesus said unto them, They n2ed not depart; give ye them to eat. 
And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes. 
He said, Bring them hither to me. 
And he co2manded the multitude to sit down on the gra2s, and t2ok the five loaves, and the two fishes, and l2oking up to heaven, he ble2sed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. 
And they did a2l eat, and were fi2led: and they t2ok up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets fu2l. 
And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children. 
And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. 
And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone. 
But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, to2sed with waves: for the wind was contrary. 
And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea. 
And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. 
But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of g2od ch2er; it is I; be not afraid. 
And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto th2e on the water. 
And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. 
But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and begi2ning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. 
And i2mediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of li2tle faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? 
And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. 
Then they that were in the ship came and worshi2ped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God. 
And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Ge2nesaret. 
And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into a2l that country round about, and brought unto him a2l that were diseased; 
And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole. 
Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharis2es, which were of Jerusalem, saying, 
Why do thy disciples transgre2s the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. 
But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgre2s the co2mandment of God by your tradition? 
For God co2manded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. 
But ye say, Whosoever sha2l say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; 
And honour not his father or his mother, he sha2l be fr2e. Thus have ye made the co2mandment of God of none e2fect by your tradition. 
Ye hypocrites, we2l did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, 
This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. 
But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the co2mandments of men. 
And he ca2led the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand: 
Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. 
Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharis2es were o2fended, after they heard this saying? 
But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, sha2l be r2oted up. 
Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both sha2l fa2l into the ditch. 
Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable. 
And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? 
Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the be2ly, and is cast out into the draught? 
But those things which proc2ed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. 
For out of the heart proc2ed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witne2s, blasphemies: 
These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. 
Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. 
And, behold, a woman of Can2an came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. 
But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. 
But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sh2ep of the house of Israel. 
Then came she and worshi2ped him, saying, Lord, help me. 
But he answered and said, It is not m2et to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs. 
And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fa2l from their masters' table. 
Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto th2e even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour. 
And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galil2e; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there. 
And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' f2et; and he healed them: 
Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to s2e: and they glorified the God of Israel. 
Then Jesus ca2led his disciples unto him, and said, I have compa2sion on the multitude, because they continue with me now thr2e days, and have nothing to eat: and I wi2l not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way. 
And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderne2s, as to fi2l so great a multitude? 
And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few li2tle fishes. 
And he co2manded the multitude to sit down on the ground. 
And he t2ok the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. 
And they did a2l eat, and were fi2led: and they t2ok up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets fu2l. 
And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children. 
And he sent away the multitude, and t2ok ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala. 
The Pharis2es also with the Sa2duc2es came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven. 
He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It wi2l be fair weather: for the sky is red. 
And in the morning, It wi2l be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times? 
A wicked and adulterous generation s2eketh after a sign; and there sha2l no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed. 
And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgo2ten to take bread. 
Then Jesus said unto them, Take h2ed and beware of the leaven of the Pharis2es and of the Sa2duc2es. 
And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread. 
Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of li2tle faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread? 
Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye t2ok up? 
Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye t2ok up? 
How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharis2es and of the Sa2duc2es? 
Then underst2od they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharis2es and of the Sa2duc2es. 
When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Phili2pi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am? 
And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets. 
He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? 
And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. 
And Jesus answered and said unto him, Ble2sed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and bl2od hath not revealed it unto th2e, but my Father which is in heaven. 
And I say also unto th2e, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I wi2l build my church; and the gates of he2l sha2l not prevail against it. 
And I wi2l give unto th2e the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth sha2l be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt l2ose on earth sha2l be l2osed in heaven. 
Then charged he his disciples that they should te2l no man that he was Jesus the Christ. 
From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and su2fer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be ki2led, and be raised again the third day. 
Then Peter t2ok him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from th2e, Lord: this sha2l not be unto th2e. 
But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get th2e behind me, Satan: thou art an o2fence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men. 
Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man wi2l come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cro2s, and fo2low me. 
For whosoever wi2l save his life sha2l lose it: and whosoever wi2l lose his life for my sake sha2l find it. 
For what is a man profited, if he sha2l gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what sha2l a man give in exchange for his soul? 
For the Son of man sha2l come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he sha2l reward every man a2cording to his works. 
Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which sha2l not taste of death, ti2l they s2e the Son of man coming in his kingdom. 
And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart, 
And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. 
And, behold, there a2peared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him. 
Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is g2od for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here thr2e tabernacles; one for th2e, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. 
While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am we2l pleased; hear ye him. 
And when the disciples heard it, they fe2l on their face, and were sore afraid. 
And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid. 
And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only. 
And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Te2l the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead. 
And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come? 
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly sha2l first come, and restore a2l things. 
But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise sha2l also the Son of man su2fer of them. 
Then the disciples underst2od that he spake unto them of John the Baptist. 
And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kn2eling down to him, and saying, 
Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for of2times he fa2leth into the fire, and oft into the water. 
And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him. 
Then Jesus answered and said, O faithle2s and perverse generation, how long sha2l I be with you? how long sha2l I su2fer you? bring him hither to me. 
And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour. 
Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? 
And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard s2ed, ye sha2l say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it sha2l remove; and nothing sha2l be impo2sible unto you. 
Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting. 
And while they abode in Galil2e, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man sha2l be betrayed into the hands of men: 
And they sha2l ki2l him, and the third day he sha2l be raised again. And they were exc2eding so2ry. 
And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute? 
He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers? 
Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children fr2e. 
Notwithstanding, lest we should o2fend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an h2ok, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and th2e. 
At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? 
And Jesus ca2led a li2tle child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, 
And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as li2tle children, ye sha2l not enter into the kingdom of heaven. 
Whosoever therefore sha2l humble himself as this li2tle child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 
And whoso sha2l receive one such li2tle child in my name receiveth me. 
But whoso sha2l o2fend one of these li2tle ones which believe in me, it were be2ter for him that a mi2lstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. 
Woe unto the world because of o2fences! for it must n2eds be that o2fences come; but woe to that man by whom the o2fence cometh! 
Wherefore if thy hand or thy f2ot o2fend th2e, cut them o2f, and cast them from th2e: it is be2ter for th2e to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two f2et to be cast into everlasting fire. 
And if thine eye o2fend th2e, pluck it out, and cast it from th2e: it is be2ter for th2e to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into he2l fire. 
Take h2ed that ye despise not one of these li2tle ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven. 
For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost. 
How think ye? if a man have an hundred sh2ep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and s2eketh that which is gone astray? 
And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sh2ep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray. 
Even so it is not the wi2l of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these li2tle ones should perish. 
Moreover if thy brother sha2l trespa2s against th2e, go and te2l him his fault betw2en th2e and him alone: if he sha2l hear th2e, thou hast gained thy brother. 
But if he wi2l not hear th2e, then take with th2e one or two more, that in the mouth of two or thr2e witne2ses every word may be established. 
And if he sha2l neglect to hear them, te2l it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto th2e as an heathen man and a publican. 
Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye sha2l bind on earth sha2l be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye sha2l l2ose on earth sha2l be l2osed in heaven. 
Again I say unto you, That if two of you sha2l agr2e on earth as touching any thing that they sha2l ask, it sha2l be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. 
For where two or thr2e are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. 
Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft sha2l my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? ti2l seven times? 
Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto th2e, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven. 
Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take a2count of his servants. 
And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents. 
But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord co2manded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and a2l that he had, and payment to be made. 
The servant therefore fe2l down, and worshi2ped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I wi2l pay th2e a2l. 
Then the lord of that servant was moved with compa2sion, and l2osed him, and forgave him the debt. 
But the same servant went out, and found one of his fe2lowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and t2ok him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. 
And his fe2lowservant fe2l down at his f2et, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I wi2l pay th2e a2l. 
And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, ti2l he should pay the debt. 
So when his fe2lowservants saw what was done, they were very so2ry, and came and told unto their lord a2l that was done. 
Then his lord, after that he had ca2led him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave th2e a2l that debt, because thou desiredst me: 
Shouldest not thou also have had compa2sion on thy fe2lowservant, even as I had pity on th2e? 
And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, ti2l he should pay a2l that was due unto him. 
So likewise sha2l my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespa2ses. 
And it came to pa2s, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galil2e, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan; 
And great multitudes fo2lowed him; and he healed them there. 
The Pharis2es also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause? 
And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the begi2ning made them male and female, 
And said, For this cause sha2l a man leave father and mother, and sha2l cleave to his wife: and they twain sha2l be one flesh? 
Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. 
They say unto him, Why did Moses then co2mand to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away? 
He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardne2s of your hearts su2fered you to put away your wives: but from the begi2ning it was not so. 
And I say unto you, Whosoever sha2l put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and sha2l ma2ry another, co2mi2teth adultery: and whoso ma2rieth her which is put away doth co2mit adultery. 
His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not g2od to ma2ry. 
But he said unto them, A2l men ca2not receive this saying, save they to whom it is given. 
For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it. 
Then were there brought unto him li2tle children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them. 
But Jesus said, Su2fer li2tle children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven. 
And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence. 
And, behold, one came and said unto him, G2od Master, what g2od thing sha2l I do, that I may have eternal life? 
And he said unto him, Why ca2lest thou me g2od? there is none g2od but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, k2ep the co2mandments. 
He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not co2mit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witne2s, 
Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 
The young man saith unto him, A2l these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? 
Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and se2l that thou hast, and give to the p2or, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and fo2low me. 
But when the young man heard that saying, he went away so2rowful: for he had great po2se2sions. 
Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man sha2l hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. 
And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a n2edle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 
When his disciples heard it, they were exc2edingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved? 
But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impo2sible; but with God a2l things are po2sible. 
Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken a2l, and fo2lowed th2e; what sha2l we have therefore? 
And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have fo2lowed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man sha2l sit in the throne of his glory, ye also sha2l sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 
And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, sha2l receive an hundredfold, and sha2l inherit everlasting life. 
But many that are first sha2l be last; and the last sha2l be first. 
For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard. 
And when he had agr2ed with the labourers for a pe2ny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. 
And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, 
And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I wi2l give you. And they went their way. 
Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise. 
And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here a2l the day idle? 
They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that sha2l ye receive. 
So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Ca2l the labourers, and give them their hire, begi2ning from the last unto the first. 
And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a pe2ny. 
But when the first came, they su2posed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a pe2ny. 
And when they had received it, they murmured against the g2odman of the house, 
Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day. 
But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do th2e no wrong: didst not thou agr2e with me for a pe2ny? 
Take that thine is, and go thy way: I wi2l give unto this last, even as unto th2e. 
Is it not lawful for me to do what I wi2l with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am g2od? 
So the last sha2l be first, and the first last: for many be ca2led, but few chosen. 
And Jesus going up to Jerusalem t2ok the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them, 
Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man sha2l be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they sha2l condemn him to death, 
And sha2l deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he sha2l rise again. 
Then came to him the mother of Zebed2es children with her sons, worshi2ping him, and desiring a certain thing of him. 
And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom. 
But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I sha2l drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able. 
And he saith unto them, Ye sha2l drink ind2ed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it sha2l be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father. 
And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren. 
But Jesus ca2led them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. 
But it sha2l not be so among you: but whosoever wi2l be great among you, let him be your minister; 
And whosoever wi2l be chief among you, let him be your servant: 
Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. 
And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude fo2lowed him. 
And, behold, two blind men si2ting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus pa2sed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David. 
And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David. 
And Jesus st2od sti2l, and ca2led them, and said, What wi2l ye that I sha2l do unto you? 
They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened. 
So Jesus had compa2sion on them, and touched their eyes: and i2mediately their eyes received sight, and they fo2lowed him. 
And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples, 
Saying unto them, Go into the vi2lage over against you, and straightway ye sha2l find an a2s tied, and a colt with her: l2ose them, and bring them unto me. 
And if any man say ought unto you, ye sha2l say, The Lord hath n2ed of them; and straightway he wi2l send them. 
A2l this was done, that it might be fulfi2led which was spoken by the prophet, saying, 
Te2l ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto th2e, m2ek, and si2ting upon an a2s, and a colt the foal of an a2s. 
And the disciples went, and did as Jesus co2manded them, 
And brought the a2s, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon. 
And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the tr2es, and strawed them in the way. 
And the multitudes that went before, and that fo2lowed, cried, saying, Hosa2na to the son of David: Ble2sed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosa2na in the highest. 
And when he was come into Jerusalem, a2l the city was moved, saying, Who is this? 
And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galil2e. 
And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out a2l them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, 
And said unto them, It is wri2ten, My house sha2l be ca2led the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves. 
And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them. 
And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosa2na to the son of David; they were sore displeased, 
And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise? 
And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there. 
Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered. 
And when he saw a fig tr2e in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on th2e henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tr2e withered away. 
And when the disciples saw it, they marve2led, saying, How s2on is the fig tr2e withered away! 
Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye sha2l not only do this which is done to the fig tr2e, but also if ye sha2l say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it sha2l be done. 
And a2l things, whatsoever ye sha2l ask in prayer, believing, ye sha2l receive. 
And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave th2e this authority? 
And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also wi2l ask you one thing, which if ye te2l me, I in like wise wi2l te2l you by what authority I do these things. 
The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we sha2l say, From heaven; he wi2l say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him? 
But if we sha2l say, Of men; we fear the people; for a2l hold John as a prophet. 
And they answered Jesus, and said, We ca2not te2l. And he said unto them, Neither te2l I you by what authority I do these things. 
But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard. 
He answered and said, I wi2l not: but afterward he repented, and went. 
And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not. 
Whether of them twain did the wi2l of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. 
For John came unto you in the way of righteousne2s, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had s2en it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him. 
Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and di2ged a winepre2s in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country: 
And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it. 
And the husbandmen t2ok his servants, and beat one, and ki2led another, and stoned another. 
Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise. 
But last of a2l he sent unto them his son, saying, They wi2l reverence my son. 
But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us ki2l him, and let us seize on his inheritance. 
And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. 
When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what wi2l he do unto those husbandmen? 
They say unto him, He wi2l miserably destroy those wicked men, and wi2l let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which sha2l render him the fruits in their seasons. 
Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marve2lous in our eyes? 
Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God sha2l be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. 
And whosoever sha2l fa2l on this stone sha2l be broken: but on whomsoever it sha2l fa2l, it wi2l grind him to powder. 
And when the chief priests and Pharis2es had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them. 
But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they t2ok him for a prophet. 
And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said, 
The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a ma2riage for his son, 
And sent forth his servants to ca2l them that were bi2den to the we2ding: and they would not come. 
Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Te2l them which are bi2den, Behold, I have prepared my di2ner: my oxen and my fatlings are ki2led, and a2l things are ready: come unto the ma2riage. 
But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise: 
And the remnant t2ok his servants, and entreated them spitefu2ly, and slew them. 
But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. 
Then saith he to his servants, The we2ding is ready, but they which were bi2den were not worthy. 
Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye sha2l find, bid to the ma2riage. 
So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together a2l as many as they found, both bad and g2od: and the we2ding was furnished with guests. 
And when the king came in to s2e the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a we2ding garment: 
And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a we2ding garment? And he was sp2echle2s. 
Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and f2ot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkne2s, there sha2l be w2eping and gnashing of t2eth. 
For many are ca2led, but few are chosen. 
Then went the Pharis2es, and t2ok counsel how they might entangle him in his talk. 
And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men. 
Te2l us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? 
But Jesus perceived their wickedne2s, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? 
Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a pe2ny. 
And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? 
They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's. 
When they had heard these words, they marve2led, and left him, and went their way. 
The same day came to him the Sa2duc2es, which say that there is no resu2rection, and asked him, 
Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother sha2l ma2ry his wife, and raise up s2ed unto his brother. 
Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had ma2ried a wife, deceased, and, having no i2sue, left his wife unto his brother: 
Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh. 
And last of a2l the woman died also. 
Therefore in the resu2rection whose wife sha2l she be of the seven? for they a2l had her. 
Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do e2r, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God. 
For in the resu2rection they neither ma2ry, nor are given in ma2riage, but are as the angels of God in heaven. 
But as touching the resu2rection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, 
I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Is2ac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. 
And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine. 
But when the Pharis2es had heard that he had put the Sa2duc2es to silence, they were gathered together. 
Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, 
Master, which is the great co2mandment in the law? 
Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with a2l thy heart, and with a2l thy soul, and with a2l thy mind. 
This is the first and great co2mandment. 
And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 
On these two co2mandments hang a2l the law and the prophets. 
While the Pharis2es were gathered together, Jesus asked them, 
Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David. 
He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit ca2l him Lord, saying, 
The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, ti2l I make thine enemies thy f2otst2ol? 
If David then ca2l him Lord, how is he his son? 
And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions. 
Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, 
Saying The scribes and the Pharis2es sit in Moses' seat: 
A2l therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. 
For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves wi2l not move them with one of their fingers. 
But a2l their works they do for to be s2en of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, 
And love the u2permost r2oms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, 
And gr2etings in the markets, and to be ca2led of men, Ra2bi, Ra2bi. 
But be not ye ca2led Ra2bi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and a2l ye are brethren. 
And ca2l no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven. 
Neither be ye ca2led masters: for one is your Master, even Christ. 
But he that is greatest among you sha2l be your servant. 
And whosoever sha2l exalt himself sha2l be abased; and he that sha2l humble himself sha2l be exalted. 
But woe unto you, scribes and Pharis2es, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither su2fer ye them that are entering to go in. 
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharis2es, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye sha2l receive the greater damnation. 
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharis2es, hypocrites! for ye compa2s sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of he2l than yourselves. 
Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever sha2l swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever sha2l swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor! 
Ye f2ols and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold? 
And, Whosoever sha2l swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty. 
Ye f2ols and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift? 
Whoso therefore sha2l swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by a2l things thereon. 
And whoso sha2l swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwe2leth therein. 
And he that sha2l swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that si2teth thereon. 
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharis2es, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cu2min, and have omi2ted the weightier ma2ters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. 
Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swa2low a camel. 
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharis2es, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the pla2ter, but within they are fu2l of extortion and exce2s. 
Thou blind Pharis2e, cleanse first that which is within the cup and pla2ter, that the outside of them may be clean also. 
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharis2es, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which ind2ed a2pear beautiful outward, but are within fu2l of dead men's bones, and of a2l unclea2ne2s. 
Even so ye also outwardly a2pear righteous unto men, but within ye are fu2l of hypocrisy and iniquity. 
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharis2es, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, 
And say, If we had b2en in the days of our fathers, we would not have b2en partakers with them in the bl2od of the prophets. 
Wherefore ye be witne2ses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which ki2led the prophets. 
Fi2l ye up then the measure of your fathers. 
Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of he2l? 
Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye sha2l ki2l and crucify; and some of them sha2l ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city: 
That upon you may come a2l the righteous bl2od shed upon the earth, from the bl2od of righteous Abel unto the bl2od of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew betw2en the temple and the altar. 
Verily I say unto you, A2l these things sha2l come upon this generation. 
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that ki2lest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto th2e, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! 
Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. 
For I say unto you, Ye sha2l not s2e me henceforth, ti2l ye sha2l say, Ble2sed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. 
And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple. 
And Jesus said unto them, S2e ye not a2l these things? verily I say unto you, There sha2l not be left here one stone upon another, that sha2l not be thrown down. 
And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Te2l us, when sha2l these things be? and what sha2l be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? 
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take h2ed that no man deceive you. 
For many sha2l come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and sha2l deceive many. 
And ye sha2l hear of wars and rumours of wars: s2e that ye be not troubled: for a2l these things must come to pa2s, but the end is not yet. 
For nation sha2l rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there sha2l be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. 
A2l these are the begi2ning of so2rows. 
Then sha2l they deliver you up to be a2flicted, and sha2l ki2l you: and ye sha2l be hated of a2l nations for my name's sake. 
And then sha2l many be o2fended, and sha2l betray one another, and sha2l hate one another. 
And many false prophets sha2l rise, and sha2l deceive many. 
And because iniquity sha2l abound, the love of many sha2l wax cold. 
But he that sha2l endure unto the end, the same sha2l be saved. 
And this gospel of the kingdom sha2l be preached in a2l the world for a witne2s unto a2l nations; and then sha2l the end come. 
When ye therefore sha2l s2e the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) 
Then let them which be in Judaea fl2e into the mountains: 
Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house: 
Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes. 
And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! 
But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sa2bath day: 
For then sha2l be great tribulation, such as was not since the begi2ning of the world to this time, no, nor ever sha2l be. 
And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days sha2l be shortened. 
Then if any man sha2l say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. 
For there sha2l arise false Christs, and false prophets, and sha2l shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were po2sible, they sha2l deceive the very elect. 
Behold, I have told you before. 
Wherefore if they sha2l say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not. 
For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so sha2l also the coming of the Son of man be. 
For wheresoever the carcase is, there wi2l the eagles be gathered together. 
I2mediately after the tribulation of those days sha2l the sun be darkened, and the m2on sha2l not give her light, and the stars sha2l fa2l from heaven, and the powers of the heavens sha2l be shaken: 
And then sha2l a2pear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then sha2l a2l the tribes of the earth mourn, and they sha2l s2e the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 
And he sha2l send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they sha2l gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. 
Now learn a parable of the fig tr2e; When his branch is yet tender, and pu2teth forth leaves, ye know that su2mer is nigh: 
So likewise ye, when ye sha2l s2e a2l these things, know that it is near, even at the d2ors. 
Verily I say unto you, This generation sha2l not pa2s, ti2l a2l these things be fulfi2led. 
Heaven and earth sha2l pa2s away, but my words sha2l not pa2s away. 
But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. 
But as the days of Noe were, so sha2l also the coming of the Son of man be. 
For as in the days that were before the fl2od they were eating and drinking, ma2rying and giving in ma2riage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, 
And knew not until the fl2od came, and t2ok them a2l away; so sha2l also the coming of the Son of man be. 
Then sha2l two be in the field; the one sha2l be taken, and the other left. 
Two women sha2l be grinding at the mi2l; the one sha2l be taken, and the other left. 
Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. 
But know this, that if the g2odman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have su2fered his house to be broken up. 
Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh. 
Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season? 
Ble2sed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh sha2l find so doing. 
Verily I say unto you, That he sha2l make him ruler over a2l his g2ods. 
But and if that evil servant sha2l say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; 
And sha2l begin to smite his fe2lowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; 
The lord of that servant sha2l come in a day when he l2oketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, 
And sha2l cut him asunder, and a2point him his portion with the hypocrites: there sha2l be w2eping and gnashing of t2eth. 
Then sha2l the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which t2ok their lamps, and went forth to m2et the bridegr2om. 
And five of them were wise, and five were f2olish. 
They that were f2olish t2ok their lamps, and t2ok no oil with them: 
But the wise t2ok oil in their ve2sels with their lamps. 
While the bridegr2om ta2ried, they a2l slumbered and slept. 
And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegr2om cometh; go ye out to m2et him. 
Then a2l those virgins arose, and tri2med their lamps. 
And the f2olish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. 
But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that se2l, and buy for yourselves. 
And while they went to buy, the bridegr2om came; and they that were ready went in with him to the ma2riage: and the d2or was shut. 
Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. 
But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. 
Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh. 
For the kingdom of heaven is as a man trave2ling into a far country, who ca2led his own servants, and delivered unto them his g2ods. 
And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man a2cording to his several ability; and straightway t2ok his journey. 
Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents. 
And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two. 
But he that had received one went and di2ged in the earth, and hid his lord's money. 
After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them. 
And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. 
His lord said unto him, We2l done, thou g2od and faithful servant: thou hast b2en faithful over a few things, I wi2l make th2e ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 
He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them. 
His lord said unto him, We2l done, g2od and faithful servant; thou hast b2en faithful over a few things, I wi2l make th2e ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. 
Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew th2e that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed: 
And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine. 
His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed: 
Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury. 
Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. 
For unto every one that hath sha2l be given, and he sha2l have abundance: but from him that hath not sha2l be taken away even that which he hath. 
And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkne2s: there sha2l be w2eping and gnashing of t2eth. 
When the Son of man sha2l come in his glory, and a2l the holy angels with him, then sha2l he sit upon the throne of his glory: 
And before him sha2l be gathered a2l nations: and he sha2l separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sh2ep from the goats: 
And he sha2l set the sh2ep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. 
Then sha2l the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye ble2sed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 
For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye t2ok me in: 
Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. 
Then sha2l the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we th2e an hungred, and fed th2e? or thirsty, and gave th2e drink? 
When saw we th2e a stranger, and t2ok th2e in? or naked, and clothed th2e? 
Or when saw we th2e sick, or in prison, and came unto th2e? 
And the King sha2l answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. 
Then sha2l he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: 
For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: 
I was a stranger, and ye t2ok me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. 
Then sha2l they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we th2e an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto th2e? 
Then sha2l he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. 
And these sha2l go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal. 
And it came to pa2s, when Jesus had finished a2l these sayings, he said unto his disciples, 
Ye know that after two days is the feast of the pa2sover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified. 
Then a2sembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was ca2led Caiaphas, 
And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and ki2l him. 
But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people. 
Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, 
There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. 
But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? 
For this ointment might have b2en sold for much, and given to the p2or. 
When Jesus underst2od it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a g2od work upon me. 
For ye have the p2or always with you; but me ye have not always. 
For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. 
Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel sha2l be preached in the whole world, there sha2l also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. 
Then one of the twelve, ca2led Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, 
And said unto them, What wi2l ye give me, and I wi2l deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. 
And from that time he sought o2portunity to betray him. 
Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for th2e to eat the pa2sover? 
And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I wi2l k2ep the pa2sover at thy house with my disciples. 
And the disciples did as Jesus had a2pointed them; and they made ready the pa2sover. 
Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. 
And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you sha2l betray me. 
And they were exc2eding so2rowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I? 
And he answered and said, He that di2peth his hand with me in the dish, the same sha2l betray me. 
The Son of man goeth as it is wri2ten of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had b2en g2od for that man if he had not b2en born. 
Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said. 
And as they were eating, Jesus t2ok bread, and ble2sed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. 
And he t2ok the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye a2l of it; 
For this is my bl2od of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remi2sion of sins. 
But I say unto you, I wi2l not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom. 
And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. 
Then saith Jesus unto them, A2l ye sha2l be o2fended because of me this night: for it is wri2ten, I wi2l smite the shepherd, and the sh2ep of the flock sha2l be sca2tered abroad. 
But after I am risen again, I wi2l go before you into Galil2e. 
Peter answered and said unto him, Though a2l men sha2l be o2fended because of th2e, yet wi2l I never be o2fended. 
Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto th2e, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. 
Peter said unto him, Though I should die with th2e, yet wi2l I not deny th2e. Likewise also said a2l the disciples. 
Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place ca2led Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. 
And he t2ok with him Peter and the two sons of Zebed2e, and began to be so2rowful and very heavy. 
Then saith he unto them, My soul is exc2eding so2rowful, even unto death: ta2ry ye here, and watch with me. 
And he went a li2tle farther, and fe2l on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be po2sible, let this cup pa2s from me: neverthele2s not as I wi2l, but as thou wilt. 
And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asl2ep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? 
Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit ind2ed is wi2ling, but the flesh is weak. 
He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pa2s away from me, except I drink it, thy wi2l be done. 
And he came and found them asl2ep again: for their eyes were heavy. 
And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. 
Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sl2ep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of si2ners. 
Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me. 
And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. 
Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I sha2l ki2s, that same is he: hold him fast. 
And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and ki2sed him. 
And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and t2ok him. 
And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote o2f his ear. 
Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for a2l they that take the sword sha2l perish with the sword. 
Thinkest thou that I ca2not now pray to my Father, and he sha2l presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? 
But how then sha2l the scriptures be fulfi2led, that thus it must be? 
In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. 
But a2l this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfi2led. Then a2l the disciples fors2ok him, and fled. 
And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were a2sembled. 
But Peter fo2lowed him afar o2f unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to s2e the end. 
Now the chief priests, and elders, and a2l the council, sought false witne2s against Jesus, to put him to death; 
But found none: yea, though many false witne2ses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witne2ses, 
And said, This fe2low said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in thr2e days. 
And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witne2s against th2e? 
But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure th2e by the living God, that thou te2l us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. 
Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: neverthele2s I say unto you, Hereafter sha2l ye s2e the Son of man si2ting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. 
Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further n2ed have we of witne2ses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. 
What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death. 
Then did they spit in his face, and bu2feted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands, 
Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote th2e? 
Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galil2e. 
But he denied before them a2l, saying, I know not what thou sayest. 
And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fe2low was also with Jesus of Nazareth. 
And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man. 
And after a while came unto him they that st2od by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy sp2ech bewrayeth th2e. 
Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And i2mediately the cock crew. 
And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bi2terly. 
When the morning was come, a2l the chief priests and elders of the people t2ok counsel against Jesus to put him to death: 
And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor. 
Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, 
Saying, I have si2ned in that I have betrayed the i2nocent bl2od. And they said, What is that to us? s2e thou to that. 
And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself. 
And the chief priests t2ok the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of bl2od. 
And they t2ok counsel, and bought with them the po2ter's field, to bury strangers in. 
Wherefore that field was ca2led, The field of bl2od, unto this day. 
Then was fulfi2led that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they t2ok the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value; 
And gave them for the po2ter's field, as the Lord a2pointed me. 
And Jesus st2od before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest. 
And when he was a2cused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. 
Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witne2s against th2e? 
And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marve2led greatly. 
Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would. 
And they had then a notable prisoner, ca2led Bara2bas. 
Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom wi2l ye that I release unto you? Bara2bas, or Jesus which is ca2led Christ? 
For he knew that for envy they had delivered him. 
When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have su2fered many things this day in a dream because of him. 
But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Bara2bas, and destroy Jesus. 
The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain wi2l ye that I release unto you? They said, Bara2bas. 
Pilate saith unto them, What sha2l I do then with Jesus which is ca2led Christ? They a2l say unto him, Let him be crucified. 
And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified. 
When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he t2ok water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am i2nocent of the bl2od of this just person: s2e ye to it. 
Then answered a2l the people, and said, His bl2od be on us, and on our children. 
Then released he Bara2bas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified. 
Then the soldiers of the governor t2ok Jesus into the co2mon ha2l, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers. 
And they stri2ped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. 
And when they had pla2ted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a r2ed in his right hand: and they bowed the kn2e before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! 
And they spit upon him, and t2ok the r2ed, and smote him on the head. 
And after that they had mocked him, they t2ok the robe o2f from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him. 
And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compe2led to bear his cro2s. 
And when they were come unto a place ca2led Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a sku2l, 
They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with ga2l: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink. 
And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfi2led which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots. 
And si2ting down they watched him there; 
And set up over his head his a2cusation wri2ten, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left. 
And they that pa2sed by reviled him, wa2ging their heads, 
And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in thr2e days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cro2s. 
Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, 
He saved others; himself he ca2not save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cro2s, and we wi2l believe him. 
He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he wi2l have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. 
The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his t2eth. 
Now from the sixth hour there was darkne2s over a2l the land unto the ninth hour. 
And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 
Some of them that st2od there, when they heard that, said, This man ca2leth for Elias. 
And straightway one of them ran, and t2ok a spunge, and fi2led it with vinegar, and put it on a r2ed, and gave him to drink. 
The rest said, Let be, let us s2e whether Elias wi2l come to save him. 
Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. 
And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bo2tom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; 
And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, 
And came out of the graves after his resu2rection, and went into the holy city, and a2peared unto many. 
Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. 
And many women were there beholding afar o2f, which fo2lowed Jesus from Galil2e, ministering unto him: 
Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebed2es children. 
When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple: 
He went to Pilate, and be2ged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate co2manded the body to be delivered. 
And when Joseph had taken the body, he wra2ped it in a clean linen cloth, 
And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he ro2led a great stone to the d2or of the sepulchre, and departed. 
And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, si2ting over against the sepulchre. 
Now the next day, that fo2lowed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharis2es came together unto Pilate, 
Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After thr2e days I wi2l rise again. 
Co2mand therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last e2ror sha2l be worse than the first. 
Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can. 
So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and se2ting a watch. 
In the end of the sa2bath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the w2ek, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to s2e the sepulchre. 
And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and ro2led back the stone from the d2or, and sat upon it. 
His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: 
And for fear of him the k2epers did shake, and became as dead men. 
And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye s2ek Jesus, which was crucified. 
He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, s2e the place where the Lord lay. 
And go quickly, and te2l his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galil2e; there sha2l ye s2e him: lo, I have told you. 
And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word. 
And as they went to te2l his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, A2l hail. And they came and held him by the f2et, and worshi2ped him. 
Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go te2l my brethren that they go into Galil2e, and there sha2l they s2e me. 
Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests a2l the things that were done. 
And when they were a2sembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, 
Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. 
And if this come to the governor's ears, we wi2l persuade him, and secure you. 
So they t2ok the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is co2monly reported among the Jews until this day. 
Then the eleven disciples went away into Galil2e, into a mountain where Jesus had a2pointed them. 
And when they saw him, they worshi2ped him: but some doubted. 
And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, A2l power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. 
Go ye therefore, and teach a2l nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 
Teaching them to observe a2l things whatsoever I have co2manded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen. 
The begi2ning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; 
As it is wri2ten in the prophets, Behold, I send my me2senger before thy face, which sha2l prepare thy way before th2e. 
The voice of one crying in the wilderne2s, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. 
John did baptize in the wilderne2s, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remi2sion of sins. 
And there went out unto him a2l the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were a2l baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confe2sing their sins. 
And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey; 
And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to st2op down and unl2ose. 
I ind2ed have baptized you with water: but he sha2l baptize you with the Holy Ghost. 
And it came to pa2s in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galil2e, and was baptized of John in Jordan. 
And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: 
And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am we2l pleased. 
And i2mediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderne2s. 
And he was there in the wilderne2s forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him. 
Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galil2e, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, 
And saying, The time is fulfi2led, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. 
Now as he walked by the sea of Galil2e, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. 
And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I wi2l make you to become fishers of men. 
And straightway they fors2ok their nets, and fo2lowed him. 
And when he had gone a li2tle farther thence, he saw James the son of Zebed2e, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets. 
And straightway he ca2led them: and they left their father Zebed2e in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him. 
And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sa2bath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught. 
And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes. 
And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, 
Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with th2e, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know th2e who thou art, the Holy One of God. 
And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. 
And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. 
And they were a2l amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority co2mandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him. 
And i2mediately his fame spread abroad throughout a2l the region round about Galil2e. 
And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 
But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they te2l him of her. 
And he came and t2ok her by the hand, and lifted her up; and i2mediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them. 
And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him a2l that were diseased, and them that were po2se2sed with devils. 
And a2l the city was gathered together at the d2or. 
And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and su2fered not the devils to speak, because they knew him. 
And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. 
And Simon and they that were with him fo2lowed after him. 
And when they had found him, they said unto him, A2l men s2ek for th2e. 
And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth. 
And he preached in their synagogues throughout a2l Galil2e, and cast out devils. 
And there came a leper to him, bes2eching him, and kn2eling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 
And Jesus, moved with compa2sion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I wi2l; be thou clean. 
And as s2on as he had spoken, i2mediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed. 
And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; 
And saith unto him, S2e thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and o2fer for thy cleansing those things which Moses co2manded, for a testimony unto them. 
But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the ma2ter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter. 
And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house. 
And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no r2om to receive them, no, not so much as about the d2or: and he preached the word unto them. 
And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four. 
And when they could not come nigh unto him for the pre2s, they uncovered the r2of where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay. 
When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven th2e. 
But there was certain of the scribes si2ting there, and reasoning in their hearts, 
Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only? 
And i2mediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts? 
Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be forgiven th2e; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk? 
But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,) 
I say unto th2e, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house. 
And i2mediately he arose, t2ok up the bed, and went forth before them a2l; insomuch that they were a2l amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion. 
And he went forth again by the sea side; and a2l the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them. 
And as he pa2sed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus si2ting at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Fo2low me. And he arose and fo2lowed him. 
And it came to pa2s, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and si2ners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they fo2lowed him. 
And when the scribes and Pharis2es saw him eat with publicans and si2ners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and si2ners? 
When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no n2ed of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to ca2l the righteous, but si2ners to repentance. 
And the disciples of John and of the Pharis2es used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharis2es fast, but thy disciples fast not? 
And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegr2om is with them? as long as they have the bridegr2om with them, they ca2not fast. 
But the days wi2l come, when the bridegr2om sha2l be taken away from them, and then sha2l they fast in those days. 
No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that fi2led it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse. 
And no man pu2teth new wine into old bo2tles: else the new wine doth burst the bo2tles, and the wine is spi2led, and the bo2tles wi2l be ma2red: but new wine must be put into new bo2tles. 
And it came to pa2s, that he went through the corn fields on the sa2bath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn. 
And the Pharis2es said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sa2bath day that which is not lawful? 
And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had n2ed, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him? 
How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? 
And he said unto them, The sa2bath was made for man, and not man for the sa2bath: 
Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sa2bath. 
And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand. 
And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sa2bath day; that they might a2cuse him. 
And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth. 
And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do g2od on the sa2bath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to ki2l? But they held their peace. 
And when he had l2oked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardne2s of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other. 
And the Pharis2es went forth, and straightway t2ok counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him. 
But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galil2e fo2lowed him, and from Judaea, 
And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him. 
And he spake to his disciples, that a sma2l ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him. 
For he had healed many; insomuch that they pre2sed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues. 
And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fe2l down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God. 
And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known. 
And he goeth up into a mountain, and ca2leth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him. 
And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach, 
And to have power to heal sickne2ses, and to cast out devils: 
And Simon he surnamed Peter; 
And James the son of Zebed2e, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder: 
And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Ma2thew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Tha2daeus, and Simon the Can2anite, 
And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house. 
And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. 
And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself. 
And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath B2elzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils. 
And he ca2led them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan? 
And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom ca2not stand. 
And if a house be divided against itself, that house ca2not stand. 
And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he ca2not stand, but hath an end. 
No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his g2ods, except he wi2l first bind the strong man; and then he wi2l spoil his house. 
Verily I say unto you, A2l sins sha2l be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they sha2l blaspheme: 
But he that sha2l blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgivene2s, but is in danger of eternal damnation. 
Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit. 
There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, ca2ling him. 
And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without s2ek for th2e. 
And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren? 
And he l2oked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! 
For whosoever sha2l do the wi2l of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother. 
And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land. 
And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine, 
Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow: 
And it came to pa2s, as he sowed, some fe2l by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up. 
And some fe2l on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and i2mediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth: 
But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no r2ot, it withered away. 
And some fe2l among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. 
And other fe2l on g2od ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred. 
And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable. 
And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, a2l these things are done in parables: 
That s2eing they may s2e, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them. 
And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then wi2l ye know a2l parables? 
The sower soweth the word. 
And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh i2mediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts. 
And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, i2mediately receive it with gladne2s; 
And have no r2ot in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when a2fliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, i2mediately they are o2fended. 
And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word, 
And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulne2s of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. 
And these are they which are sown on g2od ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred. 
And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick? 
For there is nothing hid, which sha2l not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad. 
If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. 
And he said unto them, Take h2ed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it sha2l be measured to you: and unto you that hear sha2l more be given. 
For he that hath, to him sha2l be given: and he that hath not, from him sha2l be taken even that which he hath. 
And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast s2ed into the ground; 
And should sl2ep, and rise night and day, and the s2ed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. 
For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the fu2l corn in the ear. 
But when the fruit is brought forth, i2mediately he pu2teth in the sickle, because the harvest is come. 
And he said, Whereunto sha2l we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison sha2l we compare it? 
It is like a grain of mustard s2ed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is le2s than a2l the s2eds that be in the earth: 
But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than a2l herbs, and sh2oteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it. 
And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it. 
But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded a2l things to his disciples. 
And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pa2s over unto the other side. 
And when they had sent away the multitude, they t2ok him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other li2tle ships. 
And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now fu2l. 
And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asl2ep on a pi2low: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? 
And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be sti2l. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. 
And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? 
And they feared exc2edingly, and said one to another, What ma2ner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? 
And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. 
And when he was come out of the ship, i2mediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, 
Who had his dwe2ling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains: 
Because that he had b2en often bound with fe2ters and chains, and the chains had b2en plucked asunder by him, and the fe2ters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him. 
And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cu2ting himself with stones. 
But when he saw Jesus afar o2f, he ran and worshi2ped him, 
And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with th2e, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure th2e by God, that thou torment me not. 
For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit. 
And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many. 
And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. 
Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine f2eding. 
And a2l the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. 
And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a st2ep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea. 
And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to s2e what it was that was done. 
And they come to Jesus, and s2e him that was po2se2sed with the devil, and had the legion, si2ting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. 
And they that saw it told them how it befe2l to him that was po2se2sed with the devil, and also concerning the swine. 
And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts. 
And when he was come into the ship, he that had b2en po2se2sed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him. 
Howbeit Jesus su2fered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and te2l them how great things the Lord hath done for th2e, and hath had compa2sion on th2e. 
And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and a2l men did marvel. 
And when Jesus was pa2sed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea. 
And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fe2l at his f2et, 
And besought him greatly, saying, My li2tle daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray th2e, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she sha2l live. 
And Jesus went with him; and much people fo2lowed him, and thronged him. 
And a certain woman, which had an i2sue of bl2od twelve years, 
And had su2fered many things of many physicians, and had spent a2l that she had, and was nothing be2tered, but rather grew worse, 
When she had heard of Jesus, came in the pre2s behind, and touched his garment. 
For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I sha2l be whole. 
And straightway the fountain of her bl2od was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague. 
And Jesus, i2mediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the pre2s, and said, Who touched my clothes? 
And his disciples said unto him, Thou s2est the multitude thronging th2e, and sayest thou, Who touched me? 
And he l2oked round about to s2e her that had done this thing. 
But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fe2l down before him, and told him a2l the truth. 
And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made th2e whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague. 
While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further? 
As s2on as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe. 
And he su2fered no man to fo2low him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James. 
And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and s2eth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly. 
And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and w2ep? the damsel is not dead, but sl2epeth. 
And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them a2l out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying. 
And he t2ok the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto th2e, arise. 
And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment. 
And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and co2manded that something should be given her to eat. 
And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples fo2low him. 
And when the sa2bath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands? 
Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were o2fended at him. 
But Jesus, said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house. 
And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them. 
And he marve2led because of their unbelief. And he went round about the vi2lages, teaching. 
And he ca2led unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits; 
And co2manded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a sta2f only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse: 
But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats. 
And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide ti2l ye depart from that place. 
And whosoever sha2l not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake o2f the dust under your f2et for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It sha2l be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomo2rha in the day of judgment, than for that city. 
And they went out, and preached that men should repent. 
And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them. 
And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him. 
Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets. 
But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead. 
For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had ma2ried her. 
For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for th2e to have thy brother's wife. 
Therefore Herodias had a qua2rel against him, and would have ki2led him; but she could not: 
For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly. 
And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a su2per to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galil2e; 
And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I wi2l give it th2e. 
And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I wi2l give it th2e, unto the half of my kingdom. 
And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What sha2l I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. 
And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I wi2l that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist. 
And the king was exc2eding so2ry; yet for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her. 
And i2mediately the king sent an executioner, and co2manded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison, 
And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother. 
And when his disciples heard of it, they came and t2ok up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb. 
And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him a2l things, both what they had done, and what they had taught. 
And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat. 
And they departed into a desert place by ship privately. 
And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran af2ot thither out of a2l cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him. 
And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compa2sion toward them, because they were as sh2ep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things. 
And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far pa2sed: 
Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the vi2lages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat. 
He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Sha2l we go and buy two hundred pe2nyworth of bread, and give them to eat? 
He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and s2e. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes. 
And he co2manded them to make a2l sit down by companies upon the gr2en gra2s. 
And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties. 
And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he l2oked up to heaven, and ble2sed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them a2l. 
And they did a2l eat, and were fi2led. 
And they t2ok up twelve baskets fu2l of the fragments, and of the fishes. 
And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men. 
And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people. 
And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray. 
And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land. 
And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have pa2sed by them. 
But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they su2posed it had b2en a spirit, and cried out: 
For they a2l saw him, and were troubled. And i2mediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of g2od ch2er: it is I; be not afraid. 
And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered. 
For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened. 
And when they had pa2sed over, they came into the land of Ge2nesaret, and drew to the shore. 
And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him, 
And ran through that whole region round about, and began to ca2ry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was. 
And whithersoever he entered, into vi2lages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the str2ets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole. 
Then came together unto him the Pharis2es, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem. 
And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault. 
For the Pharis2es, and a2l the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders. 
And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen ve2sels, and of tables. 
Then the Pharis2es and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples a2cording to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands? 
He answered and said unto them, We2l hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is wri2ten, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. 
Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the co2mandments of men. 
For laying aside the co2mandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do. 
And he said unto them, Fu2l we2l ye reject the co2mandment of God, that ye may k2ep your own tradition. 
For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death: 
But ye say, If a man sha2l say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he sha2l be fr2e. 
And ye su2fer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother; 
Making the word of God of none e2fect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye. 
And when he had ca2led a2l the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand: 
There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man. 
If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. 
And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable. 
And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it ca2not defile him; 
Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the be2ly, and goeth out into the draught, purging a2l meats? 
And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. 
For from within, out of the heart of men, proc2ed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, 
Thefts, covetousne2s, wickedne2s, deceit, lasciviousne2s, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, f2olishne2s: 
A2l these evil things come from within, and defile the man. 
And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid. 
For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fe2l at his f2et: 
The woman was a Gr2ek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter. 
But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be fi2led: for it is not m2et to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs. 
And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs. 
And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter. 
And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed. 
And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galil2e, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis. 
And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his sp2ech; and they bes2ech him to put his hand upon him. 
And he t2ok him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue; 
And l2oking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. 
And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was l2osed, and he spake plain. 
And he charged them that they should te2l no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it; 
And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done a2l things we2l: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak. 
In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus ca2led his disciples unto him, and saith unto them, 
I have compa2sion on the multitude, because they have now b2en with me thr2e days, and have nothing to eat: 
And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they wi2l faint by the way: for divers of them came from far. 
And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderne2s? 
And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven. 
And he co2manded the people to sit down on the ground: and he t2ok the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people. 
And they had a few sma2l fishes: and he ble2sed, and co2manded to set them also before them. 
So they did eat, and were fi2led: and they t2ok up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets. 
And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away. 
And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha. 
And the Pharis2es came forth, and began to question with him, s2eking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him. 
And he sighed d2eply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation s2ek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There sha2l no sign be given unto this generation. 
And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side. 
Now the disciples had forgo2ten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf. 
And he charged them, saying, Take h2ed, beware of the leaven of the Pharis2es, and of the leaven of Herod. 
And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread. 
And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened? 
Having eyes, s2e ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember? 
When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets fu2l of fragments t2ok ye up? They say unto him, Twelve. 
And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets fu2l of fragments t2ok ye up? And they said, Seven. 
And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand? 
And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him. 
And he t2ok the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought. 
And he l2oked up, and said, I s2e men as tr2es, walking. 
After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him l2ok up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly. 
And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor te2l it to any in the town. 
And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Phili2pi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am? 
And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets. 
And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ. 
And he charged them that they should te2l no man of him. 
And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must su2fer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be ki2led, and after thr2e days rise again. 
And he spake that saying openly. And Peter t2ok him, and began to rebuke him. 
But when he had turned about and l2oked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get th2e behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men. 
And when he had ca2led the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever wi2l come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cro2s, and fo2low me. 
For whosoever wi2l save his life sha2l lose it; but whosoever sha2l lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same sha2l save it. 
For what sha2l it profit a man, if he sha2l gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? 
Or what sha2l a man give in exchange for his soul? 
Whosoever therefore sha2l be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also sha2l the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels. 
And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of them that stand here, which sha2l not taste of death, ti2l they have s2en the kingdom of God come with power. 
And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them. 
And his raiment became shining, exc2eding white as snow; so as no fu2ler on earth can white them. 
And there a2peared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking with Jesus. 
And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is g2od for us to be here: and let us make thr2e tabernacles; one for th2e, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. 
For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid. 
And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him. 
And su2denly, when they had l2oked round about, they saw no man any more, save Jesus only with themselves. 
And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should te2l no man what things they had s2en, ti2l the Son of man were risen from the dead. 
And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean. 
And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first come? 
And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth a2l things; and how it is wri2ten of the Son of man, that he must su2fer many things, and be set at nought. 
But I say unto you, That Elias is ind2ed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is wri2ten of him. 
And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them. 
And straightway a2l the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and ru2ning to him saluted him. 
And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them? 
And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto th2e my son, which hath a dumb spirit; 
And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with his t2eth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could not. 
He answereth him, and saith, O faithle2s generation, how long sha2l I be with you? how long sha2l I su2fer you? bring him unto me. 
And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fe2l on the ground, and wa2lowed foaming. 
And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child. 
And of2times it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compa2sion on us, and help us. 
Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, a2l things are po2sible to him that believeth. 
And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief. 
When Jesus saw that the people came ru2ning together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge th2e, come out of him, and enter no more into him. 
And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead. 
But Jesus t2ok him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose. 
And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out? 
And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting. 
And they departed thence, and pa2sed through Galil2e; and he would not that any man should know it. 
For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they sha2l ki2l him; and after that he is ki2led, he sha2l rise the third day. 
But they underst2od not that saying, and were afraid to ask him. 
And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way? 
But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest. 
And he sat down, and ca2led the twelve, and saith unto them, If any man desire to be first, the same sha2l be last of a2l, and servant of a2l. 
And he t2ok a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them, 
Whosoever sha2l receive one of such children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever sha2l receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me. 
And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he fo2loweth not us: and we forbad him, because he fo2loweth not us. 
But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which sha2l do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me. 
For he that is not against us is on our part. 
For whosoever sha2l give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he sha2l not lose his reward. 
And whosoever sha2l o2fend one of these li2tle ones that believe in me, it is be2ter for him that a mi2lstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea. 
And if thy hand o2fend th2e, cut it o2f: it is be2ter for th2e to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into he2l, into the fire that never sha2l be quenched: 
Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. 
And if thy f2ot o2fend th2e, cut it o2f: it is be2ter for th2e to enter halt into life, than having two f2et to be cast into he2l, into the fire that never sha2l be quenched: 
Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. 
And if thine eye o2fend th2e, pluck it out: it is be2ter for th2e to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into he2l fire: 
Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. 
For every one sha2l be salted with fire, and every sacrifice sha2l be salted with salt. 
Salt is g2od: but if the salt have lost his saltne2s, wherewith wi2l ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another. 
And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again. 
And the Pharis2es came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him. 
And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses co2mand you? 
And they said, Moses su2fered to write a bi2l of divorcement, and to put her away. 
And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardne2s of your heart he wrote you this precept. 
But from the begi2ning of the creation God made them male and female. 
For this cause sha2l a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife; 
And they twain sha2l be one flesh: so then they are no more twain, but one flesh. 
What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. 
And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same ma2ter. 
And he saith unto them, Whosoever sha2l put away his wife, and ma2ry another, co2mi2teth adultery against her. 
And if a woman sha2l put away her husband, and be ma2ried to another, she co2mi2teth adultery. 
And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them. 
But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Su2fer the li2tle children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. 
Verily I say unto you, Whosoever sha2l not receive the kingdom of God as a li2tle child, he sha2l not enter therein. 
And he t2ok them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and ble2sed them. 
And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one ru2ning, and kn2eled to him, and asked him, G2od Master, what sha2l I do that I may inherit eternal life? 
And Jesus said unto him, Why ca2lest thou me g2od? there is none g2od but one, that is, God. 
Thou knowest the co2mandments, Do not co2mit adultery, Do not ki2l, Do not steal, Do not bear false witne2s, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother. 
And he answered and said unto him, Master, a2l these have I observed from my youth. 
Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go thy way, se2l whatsoever thou hast, and give to the p2or, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cro2s, and fo2low me. 
And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great po2se2sions. 
And Jesus l2oked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly sha2l they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! 
And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God! 
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a n2edle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 
And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved? 
And Jesus l2oking upon them saith, With men it is impo2sible, but not with God: for with God a2l things are po2sible. 
Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left a2l, and have fo2lowed th2e. 
And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's, 
But he sha2l receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life. 
But many that are first sha2l be last; and the last first. 
And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they fo2lowed, they were afraid. And he t2ok again the twelve, and began to te2l them what things should ha2pen unto him, 
Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man sha2l be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they sha2l condemn him to death, and sha2l deliver him to the Gentiles: 
And they sha2l mock him, and sha2l scourge him, and sha2l spit upon him, and sha2l ki2l him: and the third day he sha2l rise again. 
And James and John, the sons of Zebed2e, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we sha2l desire. 
And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you? 
They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory. 
But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? 
And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye sha2l ind2ed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal sha2l ye be baptized: 
But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it sha2l be given to them for whom it is prepared. 
And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John. 
But Jesus ca2led them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are a2counted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them. 
But so sha2l it not be among you: but whosoever wi2l be great among you, sha2l be your minister: 
And whosoever of you wi2l be the chiefest, sha2l be servant of a2l. 
For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. 
And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side be2ging. 
And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me. 
And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me. 
And Jesus st2od sti2l, and co2manded him to be ca2led. And they ca2l the blind man, saying unto him, Be of g2od comfort, rise; he ca2leth th2e. 
And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus. 
And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto th2e? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight. 
And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made th2e whole. And i2mediately he received his sight, and fo2lowed Jesus in the way. 
And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples, 
And saith unto them, Go your way into the vi2lage over against you: and as s2on as ye be entered into it, ye sha2l find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; l2ose him, and bring him. 
And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath n2ed of him; and straightway he wi2l send him hither. 
And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the d2or without in a place where two ways met; and they l2ose him. 
And certain of them that st2od there said unto them, What do ye, l2osing the colt? 
And they said unto them even as Jesus had co2manded: and they let them go. 
And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him. 
And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches o2f the tr2es, and strawed them in the way. 
And they that went before, and they that fo2lowed, cried, saying, Hosa2na; Ble2sed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: 
Ble2sed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosa2na in the highest. 
And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had l2oked round about upon a2l things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve. 
And on the mo2row, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry: 
And s2eing a fig tr2e afar o2f having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet. 
And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of th2e hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it. 
And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves; 
And would not su2fer that any man should ca2ry any ve2sel through the temple. 
And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not wri2ten, My house sha2l be ca2led of a2l nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves. 
And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because a2l the people was astonished at his doctrine. 
And when even was come, he went out of the city. 
And in the morning, as they pa2sed by, they saw the fig tr2e dried up from the r2ots. 
And Peter ca2ling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tr2e which thou cursedst is withered away. 
And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. 
For verily I say unto you, That whosoever sha2l say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and sha2l not doubt in his heart, but sha2l believe that those things which he saith sha2l come to pa2s; he sha2l have whatsoever he saith. 
Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye sha2l have them. 
And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespa2ses. 
But if ye do not forgive, neither wi2l your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespa2ses. 
And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders, 
And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave th2e this authority to do these things? 
And Jesus answered and said unto them, I wi2l also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I wi2l te2l you by what authority I do these things. 
The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me. 
And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we sha2l say, From heaven; he wi2l say, Why then did ye not believe him? 
But if we sha2l say, Of men; they feared the people: for a2l men counted John, that he was a prophet ind2ed. 
And they answered and said unto Jesus, We ca2not te2l. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I te2l you by what authority I do these things. 
And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and di2ged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country. 
And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard. 
And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty. 
And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefu2ly handled. 
And again he sent another; and him they ki2led, and many others; beating some, and ki2ling some. 
Having yet therefore one son, his we2lbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They wi2l reverence my son. 
But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us ki2l him, and the inheritance sha2l be our's. 
And they t2ok him, and ki2led him, and cast him out of the vineyard. 
What sha2l therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he wi2l come and destroy the husbandmen, and wi2l give the vineyard unto others. 
And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner: 
This was the Lord's doing, and it is marve2lous in our eyes? 
And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way. 
And they send unto him certain of the Pharis2es and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words. 
And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? 
Sha2l we give, or sha2l we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a pe2ny, that I may s2e it. 
And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's. 
And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marve2led at him. 
Then come unto him the Sa2duc2es, which say there is no resu2rection; and they asked him, saying, 
Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up s2ed unto his brother. 
Now there were seven brethren: and the first t2ok a wife, and dying left no s2ed. 
And the second t2ok her, and died, neither left he any s2ed: and the third likewise. 
And the seven had her, and left no s2ed: last of a2l the woman died also. 
In the resu2rection therefore, when they sha2l rise, whose wife sha2l she be of them? for the seven had her to wife. 
And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore e2r, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God? 
For when they sha2l rise from the dead, they neither ma2ry, nor are given in ma2riage; but are as the angels which are in heaven. 
And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the b2ok of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Is2ac, and the God of Jacob? 
He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly e2r. 
And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them we2l, asked him, Which is the first co2mandment of a2l? 
And Jesus answered him, The first of a2l the co2mandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord: 
And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with a2l thy heart, and with a2l thy soul, and with a2l thy mind, and with a2l thy strength: this is the first co2mandment. 
And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other co2mandment greater than these. 
And the scribe said unto him, We2l, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he: 
And to love him with a2l the heart, and with a2l the understanding, and with a2l the soul, and with a2l the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than a2l whole burnt o2ferings and sacrifices. 
And when Jesus saw that he answered discr2etly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question. 
And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David? 
For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, ti2l I make thine enemies thy f2otst2ol. 
David therefore himself ca2leth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the co2mon people heard him gladly. 
And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces, 
And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the u2permost r2oms at feasts: 
Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these sha2l receive greater damnation. 
And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. 
And there came a certain p2or widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing. 
And he ca2led unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this p2or widow hath cast more in, than a2l they which have cast into the treasury: 
For a2l they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in a2l that she had, even a2l her living. 
And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, s2e what ma2ner of stones and what buildings are here! 
And Jesus answering said unto him, S2est thou these great buildings? there sha2l not be left one stone upon another, that sha2l not be thrown down. 
And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, 
Te2l us, when sha2l these things be? and what sha2l be the sign when a2l these things sha2l be fulfi2led? 
And Jesus answering them began to say, Take h2ed lest any man deceive you: 
For many sha2l come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and sha2l deceive many. 
And when ye sha2l hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must n2eds be; but the end sha2l not be yet. 
For nation sha2l rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there sha2l be earthquakes in divers places, and there sha2l be famines and troubles: these are the begi2nings of so2rows. 
But take h2ed to yourselves: for they sha2l deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye sha2l be beaten: and ye sha2l be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them. 
And the gospel must first be published among a2l nations. 
But when they sha2l lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye sha2l speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever sha2l be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost. 
Now the brother sha2l betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children sha2l rise up against their parents, and sha2l cause them to be put to death. 
And ye sha2l be hated of a2l men for my name's sake: but he that sha2l endure unto the end, the same sha2l be saved. 
But when ye sha2l s2e the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea fl2e to the mountains: 
And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house: 
And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment. 
But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! 
And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter. 
For in those days sha2l be a2fliction, such as was not from the begi2ning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither sha2l be. 
And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days. 
And then if any man sha2l say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not: 
For false Christs and false prophets sha2l rise, and sha2l shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were po2sible, even the elect. 
But take ye h2ed: behold, I have foretold you a2l things. 
But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun sha2l be darkened, and the m2on sha2l not give her light, 
And the stars of heaven sha2l fa2l, and the powers that are in heaven sha2l be shaken. 
And then sha2l they s2e the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory. 
And then sha2l he send his angels, and sha2l gather together his elect from the four winds, from the u2termost part of the earth to the u2termost part of heaven. 
Now learn a parable of the fig tr2e; When her branch is yet tender, and pu2teth forth leaves, ye know that su2mer is near: 
So ye in like ma2ner, when ye sha2l s2e these things come to pa2s, know that it is nigh, even at the d2ors. 
Verily I say unto you, that this generation sha2l not pa2s, ti2l a2l these things be done. 
Heaven and earth sha2l pa2s away: but my words sha2l not pa2s away. 
But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father. 
Take ye h2ed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. 
For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and co2manded the porter to watch. 
Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: 
Lest coming su2denly he find you sl2eping. 
And what I say unto you I say unto a2l, Watch. 
After two days was the feast of the pa2sover, and of unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, and put him to death. 
But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people. 
And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box, and poured it on his head. 
And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made? 
For it might have b2en sold for more than thr2e hundred pence, and have b2en given to the p2or. And they murmured against her. 
And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a g2od work on me. 
For ye have the p2or with you always, and whensoever ye wi2l ye may do them g2od: but me ye have not always. 
She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying. 
Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel sha2l be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done sha2l be spoken of for a memorial of her. 
And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them. 
And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him. 
And the first day of unleavened bread, when they ki2led the pa2sover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the pa2sover? 
And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there sha2l m2et you a man bearing a pitcher of water: fo2low him. 
And wheresoever he sha2l go in, say ye to the g2odman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I sha2l eat the pa2sover with my disciples? 
And he wi2l shew you a large u2per r2om furnished and prepared: there make ready for us. 
And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the pa2sover. 
And in the evening he cometh with the twelve. 
And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me sha2l betray me. 
And they began to be so2rowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I? 
And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that di2peth with me in the dish. 
The Son of man ind2ed goeth, as it is wri2ten of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! g2od were it for that man if he had never b2en born. 
And as they did eat, Jesus t2ok bread, and ble2sed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body. 
And he t2ok the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they a2l drank of it. 
And he said unto them, This is my bl2od of the new testament, which is shed for many. 
Verily I say unto you, I wi2l drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. 
And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. 
And Jesus saith unto them, A2l ye sha2l be o2fended because of me this night: for it is wri2ten, I wi2l smite the shepherd, and the sh2ep sha2l be sca2tered. 
But after that I am risen, I wi2l go before you into Galil2e. 
But Peter said unto him, Although a2l sha2l be o2fended, yet wi2l not I. 
And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto th2e, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. 
But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with th2e, I wi2l not deny th2e in any wise. Likewise also said they a2l. 
And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I sha2l pray. 
And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy; 
And saith unto them, My soul is exc2eding so2rowful unto death: ta2ry ye here, and watch. 
And he went forward a li2tle, and fe2l on the ground, and prayed that, if it were po2sible, the hour might pa2s from him. 
And he said, A2ba, Father, a2l things are po2sible unto th2e; take away this cup from me: neverthele2s not what I wi2l, but what thou wilt. 
And he cometh, and findeth them sl2eping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sl2epest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour? 
Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak. 
And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words. 
And when he returned, he found them asl2ep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him. 
And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sl2ep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of si2ners. 
Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand. 
And i2mediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. 
And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I sha2l ki2s, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely. 
And as s2on as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and ki2sed him. 
And they laid their hands on him, and t2ok him. 
And one of them that st2od by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut o2f his ear. 
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me? 
I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye t2ok me not: but the scriptures must be fulfi2led. 
And they a2l fors2ok him, and fled. 
And there fo2lowed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him: 
And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked. 
And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were a2sembled a2l the chief priests and the elders and the scribes. 
And Peter fo2lowed him afar o2f, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire. 
And the chief priests and a2l the council sought for witne2s against Jesus to put him to death; and found none. 
For many bare false witne2s against him, but their witne2s agr2ed not together. 
And there arose certain, and bare false witne2s against him, saying, 
We heard him say, I wi2l destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within thr2e days I wi2l build another made without hands. 
But neither so did their witne2s agr2e together. 
And the high priest st2od up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witne2s against th2e? 
But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Ble2sed? 
And Jesus said, I am: and ye sha2l s2e the Son of man si2ting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. 
Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What n2ed we any further witne2ses? 
Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they a2l condemned him to be guilty of death. 
And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to bu2fet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands. 
And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest: 
And when she saw Peter warming himself, she l2oked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth. 
But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew. 
And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that st2od by, This is one of them. 
And he denied it again. And a li2tle after, they that st2od by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy sp2ech agr2eth thereto. 
But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak. 
And the second time the cock crew. And Peter ca2led to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept. 
And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and ca2ried him away, and delivered him to Pilate. 
And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto them, Thou sayest it. 
And the chief priests a2cused him of many things: but he answered nothing. 
And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witne2s against th2e. 
But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marve2led. 
Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired. 
And there was one named Bara2bas, which lay bound with them that had made insu2rection with him, who had co2mi2ted murder in the insu2rection. 
And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them. 
But Pilate answered them, saying, Wi2l ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? 
For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy. 
But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Bara2bas unto them. 
And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What wi2l ye then that I sha2l do unto him whom ye ca2l the King of the Jews? 
And they cried out again, Crucify him. 
Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exc2edingly, Crucify him. 
And so Pilate, wi2ling to content the people, released Bara2bas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. 
And the soldiers led him away into the ha2l, ca2led Praetorium; and they ca2l together the whole band. 
And they clothed him with purple, and pla2ted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head, 
And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! 
And they smote him on the head with a r2ed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their kn2es worshi2ped him. 
And when they had mocked him, they t2ok o2f the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him. 
And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who pa2sed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cro2s. 
And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a sku2l. 
And they gave him to drink wine mingled with my2rh: but he received it not. 
And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. 
And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. 
And the superscription of his a2cusation was wri2ten over, THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. 
And the scripture was fulfi2led, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgre2sors. 
And they that pa2sed by railed on him, wa2ging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in thr2e days, 
Save thyself, and come down from the cro2s. 
Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he ca2not save. 
Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cro2s, that we may s2e and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him. 
And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkne2s over the whole land until the ninth hour. 
And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 
And some of them that st2od by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he ca2leth Elias. 
And one ran and fi2led a spunge fu2l of vinegar, and put it on a r2ed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us s2e whether Elias wi2l come to take him down. 
And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost. 
And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bo2tom. 
And when the centurion, which st2od over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God. 
There were also women l2oking on afar o2f: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the le2s and of Joses, and Salome; 
(Who also, when he was in Galil2e, fo2lowed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem. 
And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sa2bath, 
Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counse2lor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. 
And Pilate marve2led if he were already dead: and ca2ling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had b2en any while dead. 
And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. 
And he bought fine linen, and t2ok him down, and wra2ped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and ro2led a stone unto the d2or of the sepulchre. 
And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid. 
And when the sa2bath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sw2et spices, that they might come and anoint him. 
And very early in the morning the first day of the w2ek, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun. 
And they said among themselves, Who sha2l ro2l us away the stone from the d2or of the sepulchre? 
And when they l2oked, they saw that the stone was ro2led away: for it was very great. 
And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man si2ting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were a2frighted. 
And he saith unto them, Be not a2frighted: Ye s2ek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him. 
But go your way, te2l his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galil2e: there sha2l ye s2e him, as he said unto you. 
And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any man; for they were afraid. 
Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the w2ek, he a2peared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils. 
And she went and told them that had b2en with him, as they mourned and wept. 
And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had b2en s2en of her, believed not. 
After that he a2peared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country. 
And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them. 
Afterward he a2peared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardne2s of heart, because they believed not them which had s2en him after he was risen. 
And he said unto them, Go ye into a2l the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. 
He that believeth and is baptized sha2l be saved; but he that believeth not sha2l be damned. 
And these signs sha2l fo2low them that believe; In my name sha2l they cast out devils; they sha2l speak with new tongues; 
They sha2l take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it sha2l not hurt them; they sha2l lay hands on the sick, and they sha2l recover. 
So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. 
And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs fo2lowing. Amen. 
Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us, 
Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the begi2ning were eyewitne2ses, and ministers of the word; 
It s2emed g2od to me also, having had perfect understanding of a2l things from the very first, to write unto th2e in order, most exce2lent Theophilus, 
That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast b2en instructed. 
THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth. 
And they were both righteous before God, walking in a2l the co2mandments and ordinances of the Lord blamele2s. 
And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was ba2ren, and they both were now we2l stricken in years. 
And it came to pa2s, that while he executed the priest's o2fice before God in the order of his course, 
A2cording to the custom of the priest's o2fice, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. 
And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense. 
And there a2peared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. 
And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fe2l upon him. 
But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth sha2l bear th2e a son, and thou shalt ca2l his name John. 
And thou shalt have joy and gladne2s; and many sha2l rejoice at his birth. 
For he sha2l be great in the sight of the Lord, and sha2l drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he sha2l be fi2led with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb. 
And many of the children of Israel sha2l he turn to the Lord their God. 
And he sha2l go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. 
And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby sha2l I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife we2l stricken in years. 
And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto th2e, and to shew th2e these glad tidings. 
And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things sha2l be performed, because thou believest not my words, which sha2l be fulfi2led in their season. 
And the people waited for Zacharias, and marve2led that he ta2ried so long in the temple. 
And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had s2en a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained sp2echle2s. 
And it came to pa2s, that, as s2on as the days of his ministration were a2complished, he departed to his own house. 
And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying, 
Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he l2oked on me, to take away my reproach among men. 
And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galil2e, named Nazareth, 
To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. 
And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with th2e: ble2sed art thou among women. 
And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what ma2ner of salutation this should be. 
And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. 
And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt ca2l his name JESUS. 
He sha2l be great, and sha2l be ca2led the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God sha2l give unto him the throne of his father David: 
And he sha2l reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there sha2l be no end. 
Then said Mary unto the angel, How sha2l this be, s2eing I know not a man? 
And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost sha2l come upon th2e, and the power of the Highest sha2l overshadow th2e: therefore also that holy thing which sha2l be born of th2e sha2l be ca2led the Son of God. 
And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was ca2led ba2ren. 
For with God nothing sha2l be impo2sible. 
And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me a2cording to thy word. And the angel departed from her. 
And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hi2l country with haste, into a city of Juda; 
And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth. 
And it came to pa2s, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was fi2led with the Holy Ghost: 
And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Ble2sed art thou among women, and ble2sed is the fruit of thy womb. 
And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 
For, lo, as s2on as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. 
And ble2sed is she that believed: for there sha2l be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord. 
And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, 
And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. 
For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth a2l generations sha2l ca2l me ble2sed. 
For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name. 
And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation. 
He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath sca2tered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. 
He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degr2e. 
He hath fi2led the hungry with g2od things; and the rich he hath sent empty away. 
He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy; 
As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his s2ed for ever. 
And Mary abode with her about thr2e months, and returned to her own house. 
Now Elisabeth's fu2l time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son. 
And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her. 
And it came to pa2s, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they ca2led him Zacharias, after the name of his father. 
And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he sha2l be ca2led John. 
And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is ca2led by this name. 
And they made signs to his father, how he would have him ca2led. 
And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marve2led a2l. 
And his mouth was opened i2mediately, and his tongue l2osed, and he spake, and praised God. 
And fear came on a2l that dwelt round about them: and a2l these sayings were noised abroad throughout a2l the hi2l country of Judaea. 
And a2l they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What ma2ner of child sha2l this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him. 
And his father Zacharias was fi2led with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying, 
Ble2sed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and red2emed his people, 
And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David; 
As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have b2en since the world began: 
That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of a2l that hate us; 
To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant; 
The oath which he sware to our father Abraham, 
That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear, 
In holine2s and righteousne2s before him, a2l the days of our life. 
And thou, child, shalt be ca2led the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways; 
To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remi2sion of their sins, 
Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us, 
To give light to them that sit in darkne2s and in the shadow of death, to guide our f2et into the way of peace. 
And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts ti2l the day of his shewing unto Israel. 
And it came to pa2s in those days, that there went out a decr2e from Caesar Augustus that a2l the world should be taxed. 
(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) 
And a2l went to be taxed, every one into his own city. 
And Joseph also went up from Galil2e, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is ca2led Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) 
To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. 
And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were a2complished that she should be delivered. 
And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wra2ped him in swa2dling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no r2om for them in the i2n. 
And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, k2eping watch over their flock by night. 
And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. 
And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you g2od tidings of great joy, which sha2l be to a2l people. 
For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. 
And this sha2l be a sign unto you; Ye sha2l find the babe wra2ped in swa2dling clothes, lying in a manger. 
And su2denly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, 
Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, g2od wi2l toward men. 
And it came to pa2s, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and s2e this thing which is come to pa2s, which the Lord hath made known unto us. 
And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. 
And when they had s2en it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. 
And a2l they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds. 
But Mary kept a2l these things, and pondered them in her heart. 
And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for a2l the things that they had heard and s2en, as it was told unto them. 
And when eight days were a2complished for the circumcising of the child, his name was ca2led JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb. 
And when the days of her purification a2cording to the law of Moses were a2complished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord; 
(As it is wri2ten in the law of the LORD, Every male that openeth the womb sha2l be ca2led holy to the Lord;) 
And to o2fer a sacrifice a2cording to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons. 
And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him. 
And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not s2e death, before he had s2en the Lord's Christ. 
And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law, 
Then t2ok he him up in his arms, and ble2sed God, and said, 
Lord, now le2test thou thy servant depart in peace, a2cording to thy word: 
For mine eyes have s2en thy salvation, 
Which thou hast prepared before the face of a2l people; 
A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel. 
And Joseph and his mother marve2led at those things which were spoken of him. 
And Simeon ble2sed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fa2l and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which sha2l be spoken against; 
(Yea, a sword sha2l pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. 
And there was one A2na, a prophete2s, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity; 
And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day. 
And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to a2l them that l2oked for redemption in Jerusalem. 
And when they had performed a2l things a2cording to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galil2e, to their own city Nazareth. 
And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, fi2led with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him. 
Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the pa2sover. 
And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast. 
And when they had fulfi2led the days, as they returned, the child Jesus ta2ried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it. 
But they, su2posing him to have b2en in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance. 
And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, s2eking him. 
And it came to pa2s, that after thr2e days they found him in the temple, si2ting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions. 
And a2l that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers. 
And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought th2e so2rowing. 
And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's busine2s? 
And they underst2od not the saying which he spake unto them. 
And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept a2l these sayings in her heart. 
And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man. 
Now in the fift2enth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galil2e, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene, 
A2nas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderne2s. 
And he came into a2l the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remi2sion of sins; 
As it is wri2ten in the b2ok of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderne2s, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. 
Every va2ley sha2l be fi2led, and every mountain and hi2l sha2l be brought low; and the cr2oked sha2l be made straight, and the rough ways sha2l be made sm2oth; 
And a2l flesh sha2l s2e the salvation of God. 
Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to fl2e from the wrath to come? 
Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. 
And now also the axe is laid unto the r2ot of the tr2es: every tr2e therefore which bringeth not forth g2od fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. 
And the people asked him, saying, What sha2l we do then? 
He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise. 
Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what sha2l we do? 
And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is a2pointed you. 
And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what sha2l we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither a2cuse any falsely; and be content with your wages. 
And as the people were in expectation, and a2l men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not; 
John answered, saying unto them a2l, I ind2ed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unl2ose: he sha2l baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire: 
Whose fan is in his hand, and he wi2l throughly purge his fl2or, and wi2l gather the wheat into his garner; but the cha2f he wi2l burn with fire unquenchable. 
And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people. 
But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife, and for a2l the evils which Herod had done, 
A2ded yet this above a2l, that he shut up John in prison. 
Now when a2l the people were baptized, it came to pa2s, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, 
And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in th2e I am we2l pleased. 
And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was su2posed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli, 
Which was the son of Ma2that, which was the son of Levi, which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Ja2na, which was the son of Joseph, 
Which was the son of Ma2tathias, which was the son of Amos, which was the son of Naum, which was the son of Esli, which was the son of Na2ge, 
Which was the son of M2ath, which was the son of Ma2tathias, which was the son of Semei, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Juda, 
Which was the son of Joa2na, which was the son of Rhesa, which was the son of Zorobabel, which was the son of Salathiel, which was the son of Neri, 
Which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of A2di, which was the son of Cosam, which was the son of Elmodam, which was the son of Er, 
Which was the son of Jose, which was the son of Eliezer, which was the son of Jorim, which was the son of Ma2that, which was the son of Levi, 
Which was the son of Simeon, which was the son of Juda, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Jonan, which was the son of Eliakim, 
Which was the son of Melea, which was the son of Menan, which was the son of Ma2tatha, which was the son of Nathan, which was the son of David, 
Which was the son of Je2se, which was the son of Obed, which was the son of B2oz, which was the son of Salmon, which was the son of N2a2son, 
Which was the son of Aminadab, which was the son of Aram, which was the son of Esrom, which was the son of Phares, which was the son of Juda, 
Which was the son of Jacob, which was the son of Is2ac, which was the son of Abraham, which was the son of Thara, which was the son of Nachor, 
Which was the son of Saruch, which was the son of Ragau, which was the son of Phalec, which was the son of Heber, which was the son of Sala, 
Which was the son of Cainan, which was the son of Arphaxad, which was the son of Sem, which was the son of Noe, which was the son of Lamech, 
Which was the son of Mathusala, which was the son of Enoch, which was the son of Jared, which was the son of Malel2el, which was the son of Cainan, 
Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God. 
And Jesus being fu2l of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderne2s, 
Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered. 
And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, co2mand this stone that it be made bread. 
And Jesus answered him, saying, It is wri2ten, That man sha2l not live by bread alone, but by every word of God. 
And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him a2l the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 
And the devil said unto him, A2l this power wi2l I give th2e, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I wi2l I give it. 
If thou therefore wilt worship me, a2l sha2l be thine. 
And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get th2e behind me, Satan: for it is wri2ten, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. 
And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pi2nacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence: 
For it is wri2ten, He sha2l give his angels charge over th2e, to k2ep th2e: 
And in their hands they sha2l bear th2e up, lest at any time thou dash thy f2ot against a stone. 
And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. 
And when the devil had ended a2l the temptation, he departed from him for a season. 
And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galil2e: and there went out a fame of him through a2l the region round about. 
And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of a2l. 
And he came to Nazareth, where he had b2en brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sa2bath day, and st2od up for to read. 
And there was delivered unto him the b2ok of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the b2ok, he found the place where it was wri2ten, 
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the p2or; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, 
To preach the a2ceptable year of the Lord. 
And he closed the b2ok, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of a2l them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. 
And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfi2led in your ears. 
And a2l bare him witne2s, and wondered at the gracious words which proc2eded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son? 
And he said unto them, Ye wi2l surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country. 
And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is a2cepted in his own country. 
But I te2l you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up thr2e years and six months, when great famine was throughout a2l the land; 
But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow. 
And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving N2aman the Syrian. 
And a2l they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were fi2led with wrath, 
And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hi2l whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong. 
But he pa2sing through the midst of them went his way, 
And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galil2e, and taught them on the sa2bath days. 
And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power. 
And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice, 
Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with th2e, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know th2e who thou art; the Holy One of God. 
And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not. 
And they were a2l amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he co2mandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out. 
And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about. 
And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her. 
And he st2od over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and i2mediately she arose and ministered unto them. 
Now when the sun was se2ting, a2l they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. 
And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them su2fered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ. 
And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them. 
And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent. 
And he preached in the synagogues of Galil2e. 
And it came to pa2s, that, as the people pre2sed upon him to hear the word of God, he st2od by the lake of Ge2nesaret, 
And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets. 
And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a li2tle from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship. 
Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the d2ep, and let down your nets for a draught. 
And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled a2l the night, and have taken nothing: neverthele2s at thy word I wi2l let down the net. 
And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake. 
And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and fi2led both the ships, so that they began to sink. 
When Simon Peter saw it, he fe2l down at Jesus' kn2es, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. 
For he was astonished, and a2l that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken: 
And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebed2e, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men. 
And when they had brought their ships to land, they fors2ok a2l, and fo2lowed him. 
And it came to pa2s, when he was in a certain city, behold a man fu2l of leprosy: who s2eing Jesus fe2l on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 
And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I wi2l: be thou clean. And i2mediately the leprosy departed from him. 
And he charged him to te2l no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and o2fer for thy cleansing, a2cording as Moses co2manded, for a testimony unto them. 
But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities. 
And he withdrew himself into the wilderne2s, and prayed. 
And it came to pa2s on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharis2es and doctors of the law si2ting by, which were come out of every town of Galil2e, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them. 
And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him. 
And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus. 
And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven th2e. 
And the scribes and the Pharis2es began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? 
But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts? 
Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven th2e; or to say, Rise up and walk? 
But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto th2e, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house. 
And i2mediately he rose up before them, and t2ok up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God. 
And they were a2l amazed, and they glorified God, and were fi2led with fear, saying, We have s2en strange things to day. 
And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, si2ting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Fo2low me. 
And he left a2l, rose up, and fo2lowed him. 
And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them. 
But their scribes and Pharis2es murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and si2ners? 
And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole n2ed not a physician; but they that are sick. 
I came not to ca2l the righteous, but si2ners to repentance. 
And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharis2es; but thine eat and drink? 
And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegr2om is with them? 
But the days wi2l come, when the bridegr2om sha2l be taken away from them, and then sha2l they fast in those days. 
And he spake also a parable unto them; No man pu2teth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agr2eth not with the old. 
And no man pu2teth new wine into old bo2tles; else the new wine wi2l burst the bo2tles, and be spi2led, and the bo2tles sha2l perish. 
But new wine must be put into new bo2tles; and both are preserved. 
No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is be2ter. 
And it came to pa2s on the second sa2bath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, ru2bing them in their hands. 
And certain of the Pharis2es said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sa2bath days? 
And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him; 
How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone? 
And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sa2bath. 
And it came to pa2s also on another sa2bath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered. 
And the scribes and Pharis2es watched him, whether he would heal on the sa2bath day; that they might find an a2cusation against him. 
But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and st2od forth. 
Then said Jesus unto them, I wi2l ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sa2bath days to do g2od, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it? 
And l2oking round about upon them a2l, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other. 
And they were fi2led with madne2s; and co2muned one with another what they might do to Jesus. 
And it came to pa2s in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued a2l night in prayer to God. 
And when it was day, he ca2led unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles; 
Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, 
Ma2thew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon ca2led Zelotes, 
And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor. 
And he came down with them, and st2od in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of a2l Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases; 
And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed. 
And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them a2l. 
And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Ble2sed be ye p2or: for yours is the kingdom of God. 
Ble2sed are ye that hunger now: for ye sha2l be fi2led. Ble2sed are ye that w2ep now: for ye sha2l laugh. 
Ble2sed are ye, when men sha2l hate you, and when they sha2l separate you from their company, and sha2l reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake. 
Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like ma2ner did their fathers unto the prophets. 
But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation. 
Woe unto you that are fu2l! for ye sha2l hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye sha2l mourn and w2ep. 
Woe unto you, when a2l men sha2l speak we2l of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets. 
But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do g2od to them which hate you, 
Ble2s them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefu2ly use you. 
And unto him that smiteth th2e on the one ch2ek o2fer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also. 
Give to every man that asketh of th2e; and of him that taketh away thy g2ods ask them not again. 
And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. 
For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for si2ners also love those that love them. 
And if ye do g2od to them which do g2od to you, what thank have ye? for si2ners also do even the same. 
And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for si2ners also lend to si2ners, to receive as much again. 
But love ye your enemies, and do g2od, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward sha2l be great, and ye sha2l be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. 
Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. 
Judge not, and ye sha2l not be judged: condemn not, and ye sha2l not be condemned: forgive, and ye sha2l be forgiven: 
Give, and it sha2l be given unto you; g2od measure, pre2sed down, and shaken together, and ru2ning over, sha2l men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it sha2l be measured to you again. 
And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? sha2l they not both fa2l into the ditch? 
The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect sha2l be as his master. 
And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye? 
Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pu2l out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou s2e clearly to pu2l out the mote that is in thy brother's eye. 
For a g2od tr2e bringeth not forth co2rupt fruit; neither doth a co2rupt tr2e bring forth g2od fruit. 
For every tr2e is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes. 
A g2od man out of the g2od treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is g2od; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh. 
And why ca2l ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? 
Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I wi2l shew you to whom he is like: 
He is like a man which built an house, and di2ged d2ep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the fl2od arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock. 
But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and i2mediately it fe2l; and the ruin of that house was great. 
Now when he had ended a2l his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum. 
And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die. 
And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, bes2eching him that he would come and heal his servant. 
And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this: 
For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue. 
Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my r2of: 
Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto th2e: but say in a word, and my servant sha2l be healed. 
For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. 
When Jesus heard these things, he marve2led at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that fo2lowed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. 
And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had b2en sick. 
And it came to pa2s the day after, that he went into a city ca2led Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people. 
Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man ca2ried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her. 
And when the Lord saw her, he had compa2sion on her, and said unto her, W2ep not. 
And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him st2od sti2l. And he said, Young man, I say unto th2e, Arise. 
And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother. 
And there came a fear on a2l: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people. 
And this rumour of him went forth throughout a2l Judaea, and throughout a2l the region round about. 
And the disciples of John shewed him of a2l these things. 
And John ca2ling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or l2ok we for another? 
When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto th2e, saying, Art thou he that should come? or l2ok we for another? 
And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight. 
Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and te2l John what things ye have s2en and heard; how that the blind s2e, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the p2or the gospel is preached. 
And ble2sed is he, whosoever sha2l not be o2fended in me. 
And when the me2sengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderne2s for to s2e? A r2ed shaken with the wind? 
But what went ye out for to s2e? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously a2pare2led, and live delicately, are in kings' courts. 
But what went ye out for to s2e? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet. 
This is he, of whom it is wri2ten, Behold, I send my me2senger before thy face, which sha2l prepare thy way before th2e. 
For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. 
And a2l the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John. 
But the Pharis2es and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him. 
And the Lord said, Whereunto then sha2l I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like? 
They are like unto children si2ting in the marketplace, and ca2ling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept. 
For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil. 
The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a glu2tonous man, and a winebi2ber, a friend of publicans and si2ners! 
But wisdom is justified of a2l her children. 
And one of the Pharis2es desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharis2e's house, and sat down to meat. 
And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a si2ner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharis2e's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, 
And st2od at his f2et behind him w2eping, and began to wash his f2et with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and ki2sed his f2et, and anointed them with the ointment. 
Now when the Pharis2e which had bi2den him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what ma2ner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a si2ner. 
And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto th2e. And he saith, Master, say on. 
There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. 
And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Te2l me therefore, which of them wi2l love him most? 
Simon answered and said, I su2pose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. 
And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, S2est thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my f2et: but she hath washed my f2et with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. 
Thou gavest me no ki2s: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to ki2s my f2et. 
My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my f2et with ointment. 
Wherefore I say unto th2e, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom li2tle is forgiven, the same loveth li2tle. 
And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. 
And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also? 
And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved th2e; go in peace. 
And it came to pa2s afterward, that he went throughout every city and vi2lage, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him, 
And certain women, which had b2en healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary ca2led Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils, 
And Joa2na the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susa2na, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance. 
And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable: 
A sower went out to sow his s2ed: and as he sowed, some fe2l by the way side; and it was tro2den down, and the fowls of the air devoured it. 
And some fe2l upon a rock; and as s2on as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture. 
And some fe2l among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it. 
And other fe2l on g2od ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be? 
And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that s2eing they might not s2e, and hearing they might not understand. 
Now the parable is this: The s2ed is the word of God. 
Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. 
They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no r2ot, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fa2l away. 
And that which fe2l among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection. 
But that on the g2od ground are they, which in an honest and g2od heart, having heard the word, k2ep it, and bring forth fruit with patience. 
No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a ve2sel, or pu2teth it under a bed; but se2teth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may s2e the light. 
For nothing is secret, that sha2l not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that sha2l not be known and come abroad. 
Take h2ed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him sha2l be given; and whosoever hath not, from him sha2l be taken even that which he s2emeth to have. 
Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the pre2s. 
And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to s2e th2e. 
And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it. 
Now it came to pa2s on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth. 
But as they sailed he fe2l asl2ep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were fi2led with water, and were in jeopardy. 
And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm. 
And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What ma2ner of man is this! for he co2mandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him. 
And they a2rived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galil2e. 
And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs. 
When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fe2l down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with th2e, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I bes2ech th2e, torment me not. 
(For he had co2manded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fe2ters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderne2s.) 
And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him. 
And they besought him that he would not co2mand them to go out into the d2ep. 
And there was there an herd of many swine f2eding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would su2fer them to enter into them. And he su2fered them. 
Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a st2ep place into the lake, and were choked. 
When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country. 
Then they went out to s2e what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, si2ting at the f2et of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. 
They also which saw it told them by what means he that was po2se2sed of the devils was healed. 
Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again. 
Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying, 
Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto th2e. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him. 
And it came to pa2s, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were a2l waiting for him. 
And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fe2l down at Jesus' f2et, and besought him that he would come into his house: 
For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him. 
And a woman having an i2sue of bl2od twelve years, which had spent a2l her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any, 
Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and i2mediately her i2sue of bl2od stanched. 
And Jesus said, Who touched me? When a2l denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng th2e and pre2s th2e, and sayest thou, Who touched me? 
And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me. 
And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and fa2ling down before him, she declared unto him before a2l the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed i2mediately. 
And he said unto her, Daughter, be of g2od comfort: thy faith hath made th2e whole; go in peace. 
While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master. 
But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she sha2l be made whole. 
And when he came into the house, he su2fered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden. 
And a2l wept, and bewailed her: but he said, W2ep not; she is not dead, but sl2epeth. 
And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. 
And he put them a2l out, and t2ok her by the hand, and ca2led, saying, Maid, arise. 
And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he co2manded to give her meat. 
And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should te2l no man what was done. 
Then he ca2led his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over a2l devils, and to cure diseases. 
And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. 
And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece. 
And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart. 
And whosoever wi2l not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake o2f the very dust from your f2et for a testimony against them. 
And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where. 
Now Herod the tetrarch heard of a2l that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead; 
And of some, that Elias had a2peared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again. 
And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to s2e him. 
And the apostles, when they were returned, told him a2l that they had done. And he t2ok them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city ca2led Bethsaida. 
And the people, when they knew it, fo2lowed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had n2ed of healing. 
And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place. 
But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for a2l this people. 
For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company. 
And they did so, and made them a2l sit down. 
Then he t2ok the five loaves and the two fishes, and l2oking up to heaven, he ble2sed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude. 
And they did eat, and were a2l fi2led: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets. 
And it came to pa2s, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am? 
They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again. 
He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God. 
And he straitly charged them, and co2manded them to te2l no man that thing; 
Saying, The Son of man must su2fer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day. 
And he said to them a2l, If any man wi2l come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cro2s daily, and fo2low me. 
For whosoever wi2l save his life sha2l lose it: but whosoever wi2l lose his life for my sake, the same sha2l save it. 
For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away? 
For whosoever sha2l be ashamed of me and of my words, of him sha2l the Son of man be ashamed, when he sha2l come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels. 
But I te2l you of a truth, there be some standing here, which sha2l not taste of death, ti2l they s2e the kingdom of God. 
And it came to pa2s about an eight days after these sayings, he t2ok Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray. 
And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering. 
And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias: 
Who a2peared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should a2complish at Jerusalem. 
But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sl2ep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that st2od with him. 
And it came to pa2s, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is g2od for us to be here: and let us make thr2e tabernacles; one for th2e, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said. 
While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud. 
And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him. 
And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had s2en. 
And it came to pa2s, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hi2l, much people met him. 
And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I bes2ech th2e, l2ok upon my son: for he is mine only child. 
And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he su2denly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him. 
And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not. 
And Jesus answering said, O faithle2s and perverse generation, how long sha2l I be with you, and su2fer you? Bring thy son hither. 
And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father. 
And they were a2l amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at a2l things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples, 
Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man sha2l be delivered into the hands of men. 
But they underst2od not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying. 
Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest. 
And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, t2ok a child, and set him by him, 
And said unto them, Whosoever sha2l receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever sha2l receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you a2l, the same sha2l be great. 
And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he fo2loweth not with us. 
And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us. 
And it came to pa2s, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, 
And sent me2sengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a vi2lage of the Samaritans, to make ready for him. 
And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem. 
And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we co2mand fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did? 
But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what ma2ner of spirit ye are of. 
For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another vi2lage. 
And it came to pa2s, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I wi2l fo2low th2e whithersoever thou goest. 
And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. 
And he said unto another, Fo2low me. But he said, Lord, su2fer me first to go and bury my father. 
Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God. 
And another also said, Lord, I wi2l fo2low th2e; but let me first go bid them farewe2l, which are at home at my house. 
And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and l2oking back, is fit for the kingdom of God. 
After these things the LORD a2pointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself would come. 
Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest. 
Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves. 
Ca2ry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way. 
And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house. 
And if the son of peace be there, your peace sha2l rest upon it: if not, it sha2l turn to you again. 
And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house. 
And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you: 
And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. 
But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the str2ets of the same, and say, 
Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe o2f against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. 
But I say unto you, that it sha2l be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city. 
Woe unto th2e, Chorazin! woe unto th2e, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had b2en done in Tyre and Sidon, which have b2en done in you, they had a great while ago repented, si2ting in sackcloth and ashes. 
But it sha2l be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you. 
And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to he2l. 
He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me. 
And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. 
And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fa2l from heaven. 
Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over a2l the power of the enemy: and nothing sha2l by any means hurt you. 
Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are wri2ten in heaven. 
In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank th2e, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it s2emed g2od in thy sight. 
A2l things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son wi2l reveal him. 
And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Ble2sed are the eyes which s2e the things that ye s2e: 
For I te2l you, that many prophets and kings have desired to s2e those things which ye s2e, and have not s2en them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them. 
And, behold, a certain lawyer st2od up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what sha2l I do to inherit eternal life? 
He said unto him, What is wri2ten in the law? how readest thou? 
And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with a2l thy heart, and with a2l thy soul, and with a2l thy strength, and with a2l thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself. 
And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live. 
But he, wi2ling to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour? 
And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fe2l among thieves, which stri2ped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. 
And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he pa2sed by on the other side. 
And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and l2oked on him, and pa2sed by on the other side. 
But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compa2sion on him, 
And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an i2n, and t2ok care of him. 
And on the mo2row when he departed, he t2ok out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I wi2l repay th2e. 
Which now of these thr2e, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fe2l among the thieves? 
And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise. 
Now it came to pa2s, as they went, that he entered into a certain vi2lage: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house. 
And she had a sister ca2led Mary, which also sat at Jesus' f2et, and heard his word. 
But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me. 
And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: 
But one thing is n2edful: and Mary hath chosen that g2od part, which sha2l not be taken away from her. 
And it came to pa2s, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples. 
And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven, Ha2lowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy wi2l be done, as in heaven, so in earth. 
Give us day by day our daily bread. 
And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil. 
And he said unto them, Which of you sha2l have a friend, and sha2l go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me thr2e loaves; 
For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him? 
And he from within sha2l answer and say, Trouble me not: the d2or is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I ca2not rise and give th2e. 
I say unto you, Though he wi2l not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he wi2l rise and give him as many as he n2edeth. 
And I say unto you, Ask, and it sha2l be given you; s2ek, and ye sha2l find; knock, and it sha2l be opened unto you. 
For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that s2eketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it sha2l be opened. 
If a son sha2l ask bread of any of you that is a father, wi2l he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, wi2l he for a fish give him a serpent? 
Or if he sha2l ask an e2g, wi2l he o2fer him a scorpion? 
If ye then, being evil, know how to give g2od gifts unto your children: how much more sha2l your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him? 
And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pa2s, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered. 
But some of them said, He casteth out devils through B2elzebub the chief of the devils. 
And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven. 
But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house fa2leth. 
If Satan also be divided against himself, how sha2l his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through B2elzebub. 
And if I by B2elzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore sha2l they be your judges. 
But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you. 
When a strong man armed k2epeth his palace, his g2ods are in peace: 
But when a stronger than he sha2l come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him a2l his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils. 
He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me sca2tereth. 
When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, s2eking rest; and finding none, he saith, I wi2l return unto my house whence I came out. 
And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished. 
Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwe2l there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. 
And it came to pa2s, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Ble2sed is the womb that bare th2e, and the paps which thou hast sucked. 
But he said, Yea rather, ble2sed are they that hear the word of God, and k2ep it. 
And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they s2ek a sign; and there sha2l no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet. 
For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so sha2l also the Son of man be to this generation. 
The qu2en of the south sha2l rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here. 
The men of Nineve sha2l rise up in the judgment with this generation, and sha2l condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here. 
No man, when he hath lighted a candle, pu2teth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may s2e the light. 
The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is fu2l of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is fu2l of darkne2s. 
Take h2ed therefore that the light which is in th2e be not darkne2s. 
If thy whole body therefore be fu2l of light, having no part dark, the whole sha2l be fu2l of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give th2e light. 
And as he spake, a certain Pharis2e besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat. 
And when the Pharis2e saw it, he marve2led that he had not first washed before di2ner. 
And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharis2es make clean the outside of the cup and the pla2ter; but your inward part is fu2l of ravening and wickedne2s. 
Ye f2ols, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also? 
But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, a2l things are clean unto you. 
But woe unto you, Pharis2es! for ye tithe mint and rue and a2l ma2ner of herbs, and pa2s over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. 
Woe unto you, Pharis2es! for ye love the u2permost seats in the synagogues, and gr2etings in the markets. 
Woe unto you, scribes and Pharis2es, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which a2pear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them. 
Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also. 
And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers. 
Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers ki2led them. 
Truly ye bear witne2s that ye a2low the d2eds of your fathers: for they ind2ed ki2led them, and ye build their sepulchres. 
Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I wi2l send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they sha2l slay and persecute: 
That the bl2od of a2l the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation; 
From the bl2od of Abel unto the bl2od of Zacharias which perished betw2en the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It sha2l be required of this generation. 
Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered. 
And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharis2es began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things: 
Laying wait for him, and s2eking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might a2cuse him. 
In the mean time, when there were gathered together an i2numerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of a2l, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharis2es, which is hypocrisy. 
For there is nothing covered, that sha2l not be revealed; neither hid, that sha2l not be known. 
Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkne2s sha2l be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets sha2l be proclaimed upon the housetops. 
And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that ki2l the body, and after that have no more that they can do. 
But I wi2l forewarn you whom ye sha2l fear: Fear him, which after he hath ki2led hath power to cast into he2l; yea, I say unto you, Fear him. 
Are not five spa2rows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgo2ten before God? 
But even the very hairs of your head are a2l numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many spa2rows. 
Also I say unto you, Whosoever sha2l confe2s me before men, him sha2l the Son of man also confe2s before the angels of God: 
But he that denieth me before men sha2l be denied before the angels of God. 
And whosoever sha2l speak a word against the Son of man, it sha2l be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it sha2l not be forgiven. 
And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye sha2l answer, or what ye sha2l say: 
For the Holy Ghost sha2l teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say. 
And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me. 
And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you? 
And he said unto them, Take h2ed, and beware of covetousne2s: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he po2se2seth. 
And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifu2ly: 
And he thought within himself, saying, What sha2l I do, because I have no r2om where to bestow my fruits? 
And he said, This wi2l I do: I wi2l pu2l down my barns, and build greater; and there wi2l I bestow a2l my fruits and my g2ods. 
And I wi2l say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much g2ods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be me2ry. 
But God said unto him, Thou f2ol, this night thy soul sha2l be required of th2e: then whose sha2l those things be, which thou hast provided? 
So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God. 
And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye sha2l eat; neither for the body, what ye sha2l put on. 
The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment. 
Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God f2edeth them: how much more are ye be2ter than the fowls? 
And which of you with taking thought can a2d to his stature one cubit? 
If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest? 
Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in a2l his glory was not a2rayed like one of these. 
If then God so clothe the gra2s, which is to day in the field, and to mo2row is cast into the oven; how much more wi2l he clothe you, O ye of li2tle faith? 
And s2ek not ye what ye sha2l eat, or what ye sha2l drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind. 
For a2l these things do the nations of the world s2ek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have n2ed of these things. 
But rather s2ek ye the kingdom of God; and a2l these things sha2l be a2ded unto you. 
Fear not, li2tle flock; for it is your Father's g2od pleasure to give you the kingdom. 
Se2l that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief a2proacheth, neither moth co2rupteth. 
For where your treasure is, there wi2l your heart be also. 
Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning; 
And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he wi2l return from the we2ding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him i2mediately. 
Ble2sed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh sha2l find watching: verily I say unto you, that he sha2l gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and wi2l come forth and serve them. 
And if he sha2l come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, ble2sed are those servants. 
And this know, that if the g2odman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have su2fered his house to be broken through. 
Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not. 
Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to a2l? 
And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord sha2l make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season? 
Ble2sed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh sha2l find so doing. 
Of a truth I say unto you, that he wi2l make him ruler over a2l that he hath. 
But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and sha2l begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken; 
The lord of that servant wi2l come in a day when he l2oketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and wi2l cut him in sunder, and wi2l a2point him his portion with the unbelievers. 
And that servant, which knew his lord's wi2l, and prepared not himself, neither did a2cording to his wi2l, sha2l be beaten with many stripes. 
But he that knew not, and did co2mit things worthy of stripes, sha2l be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him sha2l be much required: and to whom men have co2mi2ted much, of him they wi2l ask the more. 
I am come to send fire on the earth; and what wi2l I, if it be already kindled? 
But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened ti2l it be a2complished! 
Su2pose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I te2l you, Nay; but rather division: 
For from henceforth there sha2l be five in one house divided, thr2e against two, and two against thr2e. 
The father sha2l be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. 
And he said also to the people, When ye s2e a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is. 
And when ye s2e the south wind blow, ye say, There wi2l be heat; and it cometh to pa2s. 
Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time? 
Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right? 
When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale th2e to the judge, and the judge deliver th2e to the o2ficer, and the o2ficer cast th2e into prison. 
I te2l th2e, thou shalt not depart thence, ti2l thou hast paid the very last mite. 
There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose bl2od Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. 
And Jesus answering said unto them, Su2pose ye that these Galilaeans were si2ners above a2l the Galilaeans, because they su2fered such things? 
I te2l you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye sha2l a2l likewise perish. 
Or those eight2en, upon whom the tower in Siloam fe2l, and slew them, think ye that they were si2ners above a2l men that dwelt in Jerusalem? 
I te2l you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye sha2l a2l likewise perish. 
He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tr2e planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. 
Then said he unto the dre2ser of his vineyard, Behold, these thr2e years I come s2eking fruit on this fig tr2e, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? 
And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, ti2l I sha2l dig about it, and dung it: 
And if it bear fruit, we2l: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down. 
And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sa2bath. 
And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eight2en years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself. 
And when Jesus saw her, he ca2led her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art l2osed from thine infirmity. 
And he laid his hands on her: and i2mediately she was made straight, and glorified God. 
And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sa2bath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sa2bath day. 
The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sa2bath l2ose his ox or his a2s from the sta2l, and lead him away to watering? 
And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eight2en years, be l2osed from this bond on the sa2bath day? 
And when he had said these things, a2l his adversaries were ashamed: and a2l the people rejoiced for a2l the glorious things that were done by him. 
Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto sha2l I resemble it? 
It is like a grain of mustard s2ed, which a man t2ok, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tr2e; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it. 
And again he said, Whereunto sha2l I liken the kingdom of God? 
It is like leaven, which a woman t2ok and hid in thr2e measures of meal, ti2l the whole was leavened. 
And he went through the cities and vi2lages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem. 
Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them, 
Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, wi2l s2ek to enter in, and sha2l not be able. 
When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the d2or, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the d2or, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he sha2l answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are: 
Then sha2l ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our str2ets. 
But he sha2l say, I te2l you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, a2l ye workers of iniquity. 
There sha2l be w2eping and gnashing of t2eth, when ye sha2l s2e Abraham, and Is2ac, and Jacob, and a2l the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out. 
And they sha2l come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and sha2l sit down in the kingdom of God. 
And, behold, there are last which sha2l be first, and there are first which sha2l be last. 
The same day there came certain of the Pharis2es, saying unto him, Get th2e out, and depart hence: for Herod wi2l ki2l th2e. 
And he said unto them, Go ye, and te2l that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to mo2row, and the third day I sha2l be perfected. 
Neverthele2s I must walk to day, and to mo2row, and the day fo2lowing: for it ca2not be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem. 
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which ki2lest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto th2e; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her br2od under her wings, and ye would not! 
Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye sha2l not s2e me, until the time come when ye sha2l say, Ble2sed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. 
And it came to pa2s, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharis2es to eat bread on the sa2bath day, that they watched him. 
And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy. 
And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharis2es, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sa2bath day? 
And they held their peace. And he t2ok him, and healed him, and let him go; 
And answered them, saying, Which of you sha2l have an a2s or an ox fa2len into a pit, and wi2l not straightway pu2l him out on the sa2bath day? 
And they could not answer him again to these things. 
And he put forth a parable to those which were bi2den, when he marked how they chose out the chief r2oms; saying unto them. 
When thou art bi2den of any man to a we2ding, sit not down in the highest r2om; lest a more honourable man than thou be bi2den of him; 
And he that bade th2e and him come and say to th2e, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest r2om. 
But when thou art bi2den, go and sit down in the lowest r2om; that when he that bade th2e cometh, he may say unto th2e, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with th2e. 
For whosoever exalteth himself sha2l be abased; and he that humbleth himself sha2l be exalted. 
Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a di2ner or a su2per, ca2l not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid th2e again, and a recompence be made th2e. 
But when thou makest a feast, ca2l the p2or, the maimed, the lame, the blind: 
And thou shalt be ble2sed; for they ca2not recompense th2e: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resu2rection of the just. 
And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Ble2sed is he that sha2l eat bread in the kingdom of God. 
Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great su2per, and bade many: 
And sent his servant at su2per time to say to them that were bi2den, Come; for a2l things are now ready. 
And they a2l with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must n2eds go and s2e it: I pray th2e have me excused. 
And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray th2e have me excused. 
And another said, I have ma2ried a wife, and therefore I ca2not come. 
So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the str2ets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the p2or, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind. 
And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast co2manded, and yet there is r2om. 
And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be fi2led. 
For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bi2den sha2l taste of my su2per. 
And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them, 
If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he ca2not be my disciple. 
And whosoever doth not bear his cro2s, and come after me, ca2not be my disciple. 
For which of you, intending to build a tower, si2teth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have su2ficient to finish it? 
Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, a2l that behold it begin to mock him, 
Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. 
Or what king, going to make war against another king, si2teth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to m2et him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? 
Or else, while the other is yet a great way o2f, he sendeth an amba2sage, and desireth conditions of peace. 
So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not a2l that he hath, he ca2not be my disciple. 
Salt is g2od: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith sha2l it be seasoned? 
It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghi2l; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. 
Then drew near unto him a2l the publicans and si2ners for to hear him. 
And the Pharis2es and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth si2ners, and eateth with them. 
And he spake this parable unto them, saying, 
What man of you, having an hundred sh2ep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderne2s, and go after that which is lost, until he find it? 
And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing. 
And when he cometh home, he ca2leth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sh2ep which was lost. 
I say unto you, that likewise joy sha2l be in heaven over one si2ner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which n2ed no repentance. 
Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sw2ep the house, and s2ek diligently ti2l she find it? 
And when she hath found it, she ca2leth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost. 
Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one si2ner that repenteth. 
And he said, A certain man had two sons: 
And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of g2ods that fa2leth to me. And he divided unto them his living. 
And not many days after the younger son gathered a2l together, and t2ok his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living. 
And when he had spent a2l, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want. 
And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to f2ed swine. 
And he would fain have fi2led his be2ly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. 
And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! 
I wi2l arise and go to my father, and wi2l say unto him, Father, I have si2ned against heaven, and before th2e, 
And am no more worthy to be ca2led thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. 
And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way o2f, his father saw him, and had compa2sion, and ran, and fe2l on his neck, and ki2sed him. 
And the son said unto him, Father, I have si2ned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be ca2led thy son. 
But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his f2et: 
And bring hither the fa2ted calf, and ki2l it; and let us eat, and be me2ry: 
For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be me2ry. 
Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing. 
And he ca2led one of the servants, and asked what these things meant. 
And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath ki2led the fa2ted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound. 
And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him. 
And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve th2e, neither transgre2sed I at any time thy co2mandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make me2ry with my friends: 
But as s2on as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast ki2led for him the fa2ted calf. 
And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and a2l that I have is thine. 
It was m2et that we should make me2ry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found. 
And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was a2cused unto him that he had wasted his g2ods. 
And he ca2led him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of th2e? give an a2count of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward. 
Then the steward said within himself, What sha2l I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I ca2not dig; to beg I am ashamed. 
I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. 
So he ca2led every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord? 
And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bi2l, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. 
Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bi2l, and write fourscore. 
And the lord co2mended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light. 
And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the ma2mon of unrighteousne2s; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations. 
He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. 
If therefore ye have not b2en faithful in the unrighteous ma2mon, who wi2l co2mit to your trust the true riches? 
And if ye have not b2en faithful in that which is another man's, who sha2l give you that which is your own? 
No servant can serve two masters: for either he wi2l hate the one, and love the other; or else he wi2l hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye ca2not serve God and ma2mon. 
And the Pharis2es also, who were covetous, heard a2l these things: and they derided him. 
And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly est2emed among men is abomination in the sight of God. 
The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man pre2seth into it. 
And it is easier for heaven and earth to pa2s, than one ti2tle of the law to fail. 
Whosoever pu2teth away his wife, and ma2rieth another, co2mi2teth adultery: and whosoever ma2rieth her that is put away from her husband co2mi2teth adultery. 
There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: 
And there was a certain be2gar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, fu2l of sores, 
And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fe2l from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. 
And it came to pa2s, that the be2gar died, and was ca2ried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; 
And in he2l he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and s2eth Abraham afar o2f, and Lazarus in his bosom. 
And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and c2ol my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. 
But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy g2od things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. 
And beside a2l this, betw2en us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pa2s from hence to you ca2not; neither can they pa2s to us, that would come from thence. 
Then he said, I pray th2e therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house: 
For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. 
Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. 
And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they wi2l repent. 
And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither wi2l they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead. 
Then said he unto the disciples, It is impo2sible but that o2fences wi2l come: but woe unto him, through whom they come! 
It were be2ter for him that a mi2lstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should o2fend one of these li2tle ones. 
Take h2ed to yourselves: If thy brother trespa2s against th2e, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. 
And if he trespa2s against th2e seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to th2e, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him. 
And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith. 
And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard s2ed, ye might say unto this sycamine tr2e, Be thou plucked up by the r2ot, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you. 
But which of you, having a servant plowing or f2eding ca2tle, wi2l say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat? 
And wi2l not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, ti2l I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? 
Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were co2manded him? I trow not. 
So likewise ye, when ye sha2l have done a2l those things which are co2manded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do. 
And it came to pa2s, as he went to Jerusalem, that he pa2sed through the midst of Samaria and Galil2e. 
And as he entered into a certain vi2lage, there met him ten men that were lepers, which st2od afar o2f: 
And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. 
And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pa2s, that, as they went, they were cleansed. 
And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, 
And fe2l down on his face at his f2et, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. 
And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine? 
There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger. 
And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made th2e whole. 
And when he was demanded of the Pharis2es, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: 
Neither sha2l they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you. 
And he said unto the disciples, The days wi2l come, when ye sha2l desire to s2e one of the days of the Son of man, and ye sha2l not s2e it. 
And they sha2l say to you, S2e here; or, s2e there: go not after them, nor fo2low them. 
For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so sha2l also the Son of man be in his day. 
But first must he su2fer many things, and be rejected of this generation. 
And as it was in the days of Noe, so sha2l it be also in the days of the Son of man. 
They did eat, they drank, they ma2ried wives, they were given in ma2riage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the fl2od came, and destroyed them a2l. 
Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; 
But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them a2l. 
Even thus sha2l it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. 
In that day, he which sha2l be upon the housetop, and his stu2f in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back. 
Remember Lot's wife. 
Whosoever sha2l s2ek to save his life sha2l lose it; and whosoever sha2l lose his life sha2l preserve it. 
I te2l you, in that night there sha2l be two men in one bed; the one sha2l be taken, and the other sha2l be left. 
Two women sha2l be grinding together; the one sha2l be taken, and the other left. 
Two men sha2l be in the field; the one sha2l be taken, and the other left. 
And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither wi2l the eagles be gathered together. 
And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint; 
Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man: 
And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. 
And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; 
Yet because this widow troubleth me, I wi2l avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me. 
And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith. 
And sha2l not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? 
I te2l you that he wi2l avenge them sp2edily. Neverthele2s when the Son of man cometh, sha2l he find faith on the earth? 
And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: 
Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharis2e, and the other a publican. 
The Pharis2e st2od and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank th2e, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. 
I fast twice in the w2ek, I give tithes of a2l that I po2se2s. 
And the publican, standing afar o2f, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a si2ner. 
I te2l you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself sha2l be abased; and he that humbleth himself sha2l be exalted. 
And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them. 
But Jesus ca2led them unto him, and said, Su2fer li2tle children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. 
Verily I say unto you, Whosoever sha2l not receive the kingdom of God as a li2tle child sha2l in no wise enter therein. 
And a certain ruler asked him, saying, G2od Master, what sha2l I do to inherit eternal life? 
And Jesus said unto him, Why ca2lest thou me g2od? none is g2od, save one, that is, God. 
Thou knowest the co2mandments, Do not co2mit adultery, Do not ki2l, Do not steal, Do not bear false witne2s, Honour thy father and thy mother. 
And he said, A2l these have I kept from my youth up. 
Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: se2l a2l that thou hast, and distribute unto the p2or, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, fo2low me. 
And when he heard this, he was very so2rowful: for he was very rich. 
And when Jesus saw that he was very so2rowful, he said, How hardly sha2l they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! 
For it is easier for a camel to go through a n2edle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 
And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved? 
And he said, The things which are impo2sible with men are po2sible with God. 
Then Peter said, Lo, we have left a2l, and fo2lowed th2e. 
And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, 
Who sha2l not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting. 
Then he t2ok unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and a2l things that are wri2ten by the prophets concerning the Son of man sha2l be a2complished. 
For he sha2l be delivered unto the Gentiles, and sha2l be mocked, and spitefu2ly entreated, and spi2ted on: 
And they sha2l scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he sha2l rise again. 
And they underst2od none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken. 
And it came to pa2s, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side be2ging: 
And hearing the multitude pa2s by, he asked what it meant. 
And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth pa2seth by. 
And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me. 
And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David, have mercy on me. 
And Jesus st2od, and co2manded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him, 
Saying, What wilt thou that I sha2l do unto th2e? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. 
And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved th2e. 
And i2mediately he received his sight, and fo2lowed him, glorifying God: and a2l the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God. 
And Jesus entered and pa2sed through Jericho. 
And, behold, there was a man named Za2chaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich. 
And he sought to s2e Jesus who he was; and could not for the pre2s, because he was li2tle of stature. 
And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tr2e to s2e him: for he was to pa2s that way. 
And when Jesus came to the place, he l2oked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Za2chaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house. 
And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfu2ly. 
And when they saw it, they a2l murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a si2ner. 
And Za2chaeus st2od, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my g2ods I give to the p2or; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false a2cusation, I restore him fourfold. 
And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham. 
For the Son of man is come to s2ek and to save that which was lost. 
And as they heard these things, he a2ded and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should i2mediately a2pear. 
He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. 
And he ca2led his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, O2cupy ti2l I come. 
But his citizens hated him, and sent a me2sage after him, saying, We wi2l not have this man to reign over us. 
And it came to pa2s, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he co2manded these servants to be ca2led unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading. 
Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds. 
And he said unto him, We2l, thou g2od servant: because thou hast b2en faithful in a very li2tle, have thou authority over ten cities. 
And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds. 
And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities. 
And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin: 
For I feared th2e, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow. 
And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth wi2l I judge th2e, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow: 
Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury? 
And he said unto them that st2od by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds. 
(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.) 
For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath sha2l be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath sha2l be taken away from him. 
But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me. 
And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem. 
And it came to pa2s, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount ca2led the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, 
Saying, Go ye into the vi2lage over against you; in the which at your entering ye sha2l find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: l2ose him, and bring him hither. 
And if any man ask you, Why do ye l2ose him? thus sha2l ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath n2ed of him. 
And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them. 
And as they were l2osing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why l2ose ye the colt? 
And they said, The Lord hath n2ed of him. 
And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon. 
And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way. 
And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for a2l the mighty works that they had s2en; 
Saying, Ble2sed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest. 
And some of the Pharis2es from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples. 
And he answered and said unto them, I te2l you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would i2mediately cry out. 
And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, 
Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. 
For the days sha2l come upon th2e, that thine enemies sha2l cast a trench about th2e, and compa2s th2e round, and k2ep th2e in on every side, 
And sha2l lay th2e even with the ground, and thy children within th2e; and they sha2l not leave in th2e one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation. 
And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought; 
Saying unto them, It is wri2ten, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves. 
And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him, 
And could not find what they might do: for a2l the people were very a2tentive to hear him. 
And it came to pa2s, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders, 
And spake unto him, saying, Te2l us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave th2e this authority? 
And he answered and said unto them, I wi2l also ask you one thing; and answer me: 
The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? 
And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we sha2l say, From heaven; he wi2l say, Why then believed ye him not? 
But and if we say, Of men; a2l the people wi2l stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet. 
And they answered, that they could not te2l whence it was. 
And Jesus said unto them, Neither te2l I you by what authority I do these things. 
Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time. 
And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty. 
And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefu2ly, and sent him away empty. 
And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out. 
Then said the lord of the vineyard, What sha2l I do? I wi2l send my beloved son: it may be they wi2l reverence him when they s2e him. 
But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us ki2l him, that the inheritance may be ours. 
So they cast him out of the vineyard, and ki2led him. What therefore sha2l the lord of the vineyard do unto them? 
He sha2l come and destroy these husbandmen, and sha2l give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid. 
And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is wri2ten, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner? 
Whosoever sha2l fa2l upon that stone sha2l be broken; but on whomsoever it sha2l fa2l, it wi2l grind him to powder. 
And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them. 
And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor. 
And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither a2ceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly: 
Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no? 
But he perceived their craftine2s, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me? 
Shew me a pe2ny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's. 
And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's. 
And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marve2led at his answer, and held their peace. 
Then came to him certain of the Sa2duc2es, which deny that there is any resu2rection; and they asked him, 
Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up s2ed unto his brother. 
There were therefore seven brethren: and the first t2ok a wife, and died without children. 
And the second t2ok her to wife, and he died childle2s. 
And the third t2ok her; and in like ma2ner the seven also: and they left no children, and died. 
Last of a2l the woman died also. 
Therefore in the resu2rection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife. 
And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world ma2ry, and are given in ma2riage: 
But they which sha2l be a2counted worthy to obtain that world, and the resu2rection from the dead, neither ma2ry, nor are given in ma2riage: 
Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resu2rection. 
Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he ca2leth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Is2ac, and the God of Jacob. 
For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for a2l live unto him. 
Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast we2l said. 
And after that they durst not ask him any question at a2l. 
And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's son? 
And David himself saith in the b2ok of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 
Ti2l I make thine enemies thy f2otst2ol. 
David therefore ca2leth him Lord, how is he then his son? 
Then in the audience of a2l the people he said unto his disciples, 
Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love gr2etings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief r2oms at feasts; 
Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same sha2l receive greater damnation. 
And he l2oked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury. 
And he saw also a certain p2or widow casting in thither two mites. 
And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this p2or widow hath cast in more than they a2l: 
For a2l these have of their abundance cast in unto the o2ferings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in a2l the living that she had. 
And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with g2odly stones and gifts, he said, 
As for these things which ye behold, the days wi2l come, in the which there sha2l not be left one stone upon another, that sha2l not be thrown down. 
And they asked him, saying, Master, but when sha2l these things be? and what sign wi2l there be when these things sha2l come to pa2s? 
And he said, Take h2ed that ye be not deceived: for many sha2l come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them. 
But when ye sha2l hear of wars and co2motions, be not te2rified: for these things must first come to pa2s; but the end is not by and by. 
Then said he unto them, Nation sha2l rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: 
And great earthquakes sha2l be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs sha2l there be from heaven. 
But before a2l these, they sha2l lay their hands on you, and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake. 
And it sha2l turn to you for a testimony. 
Se2tle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye sha2l answer: 
For I wi2l give you a mouth and wisdom, which a2l your adversaries sha2l not be able to gainsay nor resist. 
And ye sha2l be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you sha2l they cause to be put to death. 
And ye sha2l be hated of a2l men for my name's sake. 
But there sha2l not an hair of your head perish. 
In your patience po2se2s ye your souls. 
And when ye sha2l s2e Jerusalem compa2sed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. 
Then let them which are in Judaea fl2e to the mountains; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto. 
For these be the days of vengeance, that a2l things which are wri2ten may be fulfi2led. 
But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there sha2l be great distre2s in the land, and wrath upon this people. 
And they sha2l fa2l by the edge of the sword, and sha2l be led away captive into a2l nations: and Jerusalem sha2l be tro2den down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfi2led. 
And there sha2l be signs in the sun, and in the m2on, and in the stars; and upon the earth distre2s of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; 
Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for l2oking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven sha2l be shaken. 
And then sha2l they s2e the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. 
And when these things begin to come to pa2s, then l2ok up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh. 
And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tr2e, and a2l the tr2es; 
When they now sh2ot forth, ye s2e and know of your own selves that su2mer is now nigh at hand. 
So likewise ye, when ye s2e these things come to pa2s, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. 
Verily I say unto you, This generation sha2l not pa2s away, ti2l a2l be fulfi2led. 
Heaven and earth sha2l pa2s away: but my words sha2l not pa2s away. 
And take h2ed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunke2ne2s, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. 
For as a snare sha2l it come on a2l them that dwe2l on the face of the whole earth. 
Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be a2counted worthy to escape a2l these things that sha2l come to pa2s, and to stand before the Son of man. 
And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is ca2led the mount of Olives. 
And a2l the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for to hear him. 
Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is ca2led the Pa2sover. 
And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might ki2l him; for they feared the people. 
Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. 
And he went his way, and co2muned with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them. 
And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. 
And he promised, and sought o2portunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude. 
Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the pa2sover must be ki2led. 
And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the pa2sover, that we may eat. 
And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare? 
And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there sha2l a man m2et you, bearing a pitcher of water; fo2low him into the house where he entereth in. 
And ye sha2l say unto the g2odman of the house, The Master saith unto th2e, Where is the guestchamber, where I sha2l eat the pa2sover with my disciples? 
And he sha2l shew you a large u2per r2om furnished: there make ready. 
And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the pa2sover. 
And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. 
And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this pa2sover with you before I su2fer: 
For I say unto you, I wi2l not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfi2led in the kingdom of God. 
And he t2ok the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves: 
For I say unto you, I wi2l not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God sha2l come. 
And he t2ok bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. 
Likewise also the cup after su2per, saying, This cup is the new testament in my bl2od, which is shed for you. 
But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table. 
And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed! 
And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing. 
And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be a2counted the greatest. 
And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are ca2led benefactors. 
But ye sha2l not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. 
For whether is greater, he that si2teth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that si2teth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth. 
Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. 
And I a2point unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath a2pointed unto me; 
That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 
And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: 
But I have prayed for th2e, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. 
And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with th2e, both into prison, and to death. 
And he said, I te2l th2e, Peter, the cock sha2l not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me. 
And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing. 
Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him se2l his garment, and buy one. 
For I say unto you, that this that is wri2ten must yet be a2complished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgre2sors: for the things concerning me have an end. 
And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough. 
And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also fo2lowed him. 
And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation. 
And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kn2eled down, and prayed, 
Saying, Father, if thou be wi2ling, remove this cup from me: neverthele2s not my wi2l, but thine, be done. 
And there a2peared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. 
And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of bl2od fa2ling down to the ground. 
And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sl2eping for so2row, 
And said unto them, Why sl2ep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. 
And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was ca2led Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to ki2s him. 
But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a ki2s? 
When they which were about him saw what would fo2low, they said unto him, Lord, sha2l we smite with the sword? 
And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut o2f his right ear. 
And Jesus answered and said, Su2fer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him. 
Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves? 
When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkne2s. 
Then t2ok they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter fo2lowed afar o2f. 
And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the ha2l, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them. 
But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly l2oked upon him, and said, This man was also with him. 
And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. 
And after a li2tle while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not. 
And about the space of one hour after another confidently a2firmed, saying, Of a truth this fe2low also was with him: for he is a Galilaean. 
And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And i2mediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. 
And the Lord turned, and l2oked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. 
And Peter went out, and wept bi2terly. 
And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him. 
And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote th2e? 
And many other things blasphemously spake they against him. 
And as s2on as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying, 
Art thou the Christ? te2l us. And he said unto them, If I te2l you, ye wi2l not believe: 
And if I also ask you, ye wi2l not answer me, nor let me go. 
Hereafter sha2l the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God. 
Then said they a2l, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am. 
And they said, What n2ed we any further witne2s? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth. 
And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate. 
And they began to a2cuse him, saying, We found this fe2low perverting the nation, and forbi2ding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King. 
And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it. 
Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man. 
And they were the more fierce, saying, He sti2reth up the people, teaching throughout a2l Jewry, begi2ning from Galil2e to this place. 
When Pilate heard of Galil2e, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean. 
And as s2on as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time. 
And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exc2eding glad: for he was desirous to s2e him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have s2en some miracle done by him. 
Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing. 
And the chief priests and scribes st2od and vehemently a2cused him. 
And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and a2rayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate. 
And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity betw2en themselves. 
And Pilate, when he had ca2led together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 
Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye a2cuse him: 
No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him. 
I wi2l therefore chastise him, and release him. 
(For of nece2sity he must release one unto them at the feast.) 
And they cried out a2l at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Bara2bas: 
(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.) 
Pilate therefore, wi2ling to release Jesus, spake again to them. 
But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. 
And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I wi2l therefore chastise him, and let him go. 
And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed. 
And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. 
And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their wi2l. 
And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cro2s, that he might bear it after Jesus. 
And there fo2lowed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him. 
But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, w2ep not for me, but w2ep for yourselves, and for your children. 
For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they sha2l say, Ble2sed are the ba2ren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck. 
Then sha2l they begin to say to the mountains, Fa2l on us; and to the hi2ls, Cover us. 
For if they do these things in a gr2en tr2e, what sha2l be done in the dry? 
And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death. 
And when they were come to the place, which is ca2led Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. 
Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots. 
And the people st2od beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God. 
And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and o2fering him vinegar, 
And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. 
And a superscription also was wri2ten over him in le2ters of Gr2ek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. 
But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, s2eing thou art in the same condemnation? 
And we ind2ed justly; for we receive the due reward of our d2eds: but this man hath done nothing ami2s. 
And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. 
And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto th2e, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise. 
And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkne2s over a2l the earth until the ninth hour. 
And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. 
And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I co2mend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost. 
Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. 
And a2l the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. 
And a2l his acquaintance, and the women that fo2lowed him from Galil2e, st2od afar o2f, beholding these things. 
And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counse2lor; and he was a g2od man, and a just: 
(The same had not consented to the counsel and d2ed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God. 
This man went unto Pilate, and be2ged the body of Jesus. 
And he t2ok it down, and wra2ped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid. 
And that day was the preparation, and the sa2bath drew on. 
And the women also, which came with him from Galil2e, fo2lowed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. 
And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sa2bath day a2cording to the co2mandment. 
Now upon the first day of the w2ek, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them. 
And they found the stone ro2led away from the sepulchre. 
And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. 
And it came to pa2s, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men st2od by them in shining garments: 
And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why s2ek ye the living among the dead? 
He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galil2e, 
Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. 
And they remembered his words, 
And returned from the sepulchre, and told a2l these things unto the eleven, and to a2l the rest. 
It was Mary Magdalene and Joa2na, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles. 
And their words s2emed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not. 
Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and st2oping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pa2s. 
And, behold, two of them went that same day to a vi2lage ca2led E2maus, which was from Jerusalem about thr2escore furlongs. 
And they talked together of a2l these things which had ha2pened. 
And it came to pa2s, that, while they co2muned together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. 
But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. 
And he said unto them, What ma2ner of co2munications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? 
And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pa2s there in these days? 
And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in d2ed and word before God and a2l the people: 
And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. 
But we trusted that it had b2en he which should have red2emed Israel: and beside a2l this, to day is the third day since these things were done. 
Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; 
And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also s2en a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. 
And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. 
Then he said unto them, O f2ols, and slow of heart to believe a2l that the prophets have spoken: 
Ought not Christ to have su2fered these things, and to enter into his glory? 
And begi2ning at Moses and a2l the prophets, he expounded unto them in a2l the scriptures the things concerning himself. 
And they drew nigh unto the vi2lage, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. 
But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to ta2ry with them. 
And it came to pa2s, as he sat at meat with them, he t2ok bread, and ble2sed it, and brake, and gave to them. 
And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. 
And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? 
And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, 
Saying, The Lord is risen ind2ed, and hath a2peared to Simon. 
And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread. 
And as they thus spake, Jesus himself st2od in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. 
But they were te2rified and a2frighted, and su2posed that they had s2en a spirit. 
And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? 
Behold my hands and my f2et, that it is I myself: handle me, and s2e; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye s2e me have. 
And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his f2et. 
And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat? 
And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. 
And he t2ok it, and did eat before them. 
And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that a2l things must be fulfi2led, which were wri2ten in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. 
Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, 
And said unto them, Thus it is wri2ten, and thus it behoved Christ to su2fer, and to rise from the dead the third day: 
And that repentance and remi2sion of sins should be preached in his name among a2l nations, begi2ning at Jerusalem. 
And ye are witne2ses of these things. 
And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but ta2ry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high. 
And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and ble2sed them. 
And it came to pa2s, while he ble2sed them, he was parted from them, and ca2ried up into heaven. 
And they worshi2ped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: 
And were continua2ly in the temple, praising and ble2sing God. Amen. 
In the begi2ning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 
The same was in the begi2ning with God. 
A2l things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. 
In him was life; and the life was the light of men. 
And the light shineth in darkne2s; and the darkne2s comprehended it not. 
There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. 
The same came for a witne2s, to bear witne2s of the Light, that a2l men through him might believe. 
He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witne2s of that Light. 
That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. 
He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. 
He came unto his own, and his own received him not. 
But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: 
Which were born, not of bl2od, nor of the wi2l of the flesh, nor of the wi2l of man, but of God. 
And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only bego2ten of the Father,) fu2l of grace and truth. 
John bare witne2s of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is prefe2red before me: for he was before me. 
And of his fulne2s have a2l we received, and grace for grace. 
For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. 
No man hath s2en God at any time, the only bego2ten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. 
And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? 
And he confe2sed, and denied not; but confe2sed, I am not the Christ. 
And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. 
Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? 
He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderne2s, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias. 
And they which were sent were of the Pharis2es. 
And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet? 
John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not; 
He it is, who coming after me is prefe2red before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unl2ose. 
These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing. 
The next day John s2eth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. 
This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is prefe2red before me: for he was before me. 
And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. 
And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. 
And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt s2e the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. 
And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God. 
Again the next day after John st2od, and two of his disciples; 
And l2oking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God! 
And the two disciples heard him speak, and they fo2lowed Jesus. 
Then Jesus turned, and saw them fo2lowing, and saith unto them, What s2ek ye? They said unto him, Ra2bi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwe2lest thou? 
He saith unto them, Come and s2e. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour. 
One of the two which heard John speak, and fo2lowed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 
He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Me2sias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ. 
And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be ca2led Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone. 
The day fo2lowing Jesus would go forth into Galil2e, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Fo2low me. 
Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. 
Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. 
And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any g2od thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and s2e. 
Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite ind2ed, in whom is no guile! 
Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip ca2led th2e, when thou wast under the fig tr2e, I saw th2e. 
Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Ra2bi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel. 
Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto th2e, I saw th2e under the fig tr2e, believest thou? thou shalt s2e greater things than these. 
And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye sha2l s2e heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. 
And the third day there was a ma2riage in Cana of Galil2e; and the mother of Jesus was there: 
And both Jesus was ca2led, and his disciples, to the ma2riage. 
And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. 
Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with th2e? mine hour is not yet come. 
His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. 
And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the ma2ner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or thr2e firkins apiece. 
Jesus saith unto them, Fi2l the waterpots with water. And they fi2led them up to the brim. 
And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it. 
When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast ca2led the bridegr2om, 
And saith unto him, Every man at the begi2ning doth set forth g2od wine; and when men have we2l drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the g2od wine until now. 
This begi2ning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galil2e, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. 
After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days. 
And the Jews' pa2sover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sh2ep and doves, and the changers of money si2ting: 
And when he had made a scourge of sma2l cords, he drove them a2l out of the temple, and the sh2ep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; 
And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise. 
And his disciples remembered that it was wri2ten, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. 
Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, s2eing that thou doest these things? 
Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in thr2e days I wi2l raise it up. 
Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in thr2e days? 
But he spake of the temple of his body. 
When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. 
Now when he was in Jerusalem at the pa2sover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. 
But Jesus did not co2mit himself unto them, because he knew a2l men, 
And n2eded not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man. 
There was a man of the Pharis2es, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: 
The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Ra2bi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. 
Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto th2e, Except a man be born again, he ca2not s2e the kingdom of God. 
Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? 
Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto th2e, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he ca2not enter into the kingdom of God. 
That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. 
Marvel not that I said unto th2e, Ye must be born again. 
The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not te2l whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. 
Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? 
Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? 
Verily, verily, I say unto th2e, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have s2en; and ye receive not our witne2s. 
If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how sha2l ye believe, if I te2l you of heavenly things? 
And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. 
And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderne2s, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: 
That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. 
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only bego2ten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 
For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. 
He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only bego2ten Son of God. 
And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkne2s rather than light, because their d2eds were evil. 
For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his d2eds should be reproved. 
But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his d2eds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. 
After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he ta2ried with them, and baptized. 
And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized. 
For John was not yet cast into prison. 
Then there arose a question betw2en some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying. 
And they came unto John, and said unto him, Ra2bi, he that was with th2e beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witne2s, behold, the same baptizeth, and a2l men come to him. 
John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven. 
Ye yourselves bear me witne2s, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him. 
He that hath the bride is the bridegr2om: but the friend of the bridegr2om, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegr2om's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfi2led. 
He must increase, but I must decrease. 
He that cometh from above is above a2l: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above a2l. 
And what he hath s2en and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony. 
He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true. 
For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him. 
The Father loveth the Son, and hath given a2l things into his hand. 
He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son sha2l not s2e life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. 
When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharis2es had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, 
(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) 
He left Judaea, and departed again into Galil2e. 
And he must n2eds go through Samaria. 
Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is ca2led Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 
Now Jacob's we2l was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the we2l: and it was about the sixth hour. 
There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. 
(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) 
Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. 
Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to th2e, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given th2e living water. 
The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the we2l is d2ep: from whence then hast thou that living water? 
Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the we2l, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his ca2tle? 
Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water sha2l thirst again: 
But whosoever drinketh of the water that I sha2l give him sha2l never thirst; but the water that I sha2l give him sha2l be in him a we2l of water springing up into everlasting life. 
The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. 
Jesus saith unto her, Go, ca2l thy husband, and come hither. 
The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast we2l said, I have no husband: 
For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. 
The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. 
Our fathers worshi2ped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 
Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye sha2l neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. 
Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. 
But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshi2pers sha2l worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father s2eketh such to worship him. 
God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. 
The woman saith unto him, I know that Me2sias cometh, which is ca2led Christ: when he is come, he wi2l te2l us a2l things. 
Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto th2e am he. 
And upon this came his disciples, and marve2led that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What s2ekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? 
The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, 
Come, s2e a man, which told me a2l things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? 
Then they went out of the city, and came unto him. 
In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. 
But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. 
Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat? 
Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the wi2l of him that sent me, and to finish his work. 
Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and l2ok on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. 
And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. 
And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. 
I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. 
And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me a2l that ever I did. 
So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would ta2ry with them: and he abode there two days. 
And many more believed because of his own word; 
And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is ind2ed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. 
Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galil2e. 
For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. 
Then when he was come into Galil2e, the Galilaeans received him, having s2en a2l the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast. 
So Jesus came again into Cana of Galil2e, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. 
When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galil2e, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. 
Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye s2e signs and wonders, ye wi2l not believe. 
The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. 
Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. 
And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth. 
Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. 
So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house. 
This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galil2e. 
After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 
Now there is at Jerusalem by the sh2ep market a p2ol, which is ca2led in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. 
In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. 
For an angel went down at a certain season into the p2ol, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water ste2ped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. 
And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. 
When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had b2en now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? 
The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the p2ol: but while I am coming, another ste2peth down before me. 
Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. 
And i2mediately the man was made whole, and t2ok up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sa2bath. 
The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sa2bath day: it is not lawful for th2e to ca2ry thy bed. 
He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. 
Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto th2e, Take up thy bed, and walk? 
And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place. 
Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto th2e. 
The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole. 
And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sa2bath day. 
But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. 
Therefore the Jews sought the more to ki2l him, because he not only had broken the sa2bath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God. 
Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he s2eth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. 
For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him a2l things that himself doeth: and he wi2l shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. 
For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he wi2l. 
For the Father judgeth no man, but hath co2mi2ted a2l judgment unto the Son: 
That a2l men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and sha2l not come into condemnation; but is pa2sed from death unto life. 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead sha2l hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear sha2l live. 
For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; 
And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. 
Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which a2l that are in the graves sha2l hear his voice, 
And sha2l come forth; they that have done g2od, unto the resu2rection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resu2rection of damnation. 
I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I s2ek not mine own wi2l, but the wi2l of the Father which hath sent me. 
If I bear witne2s of myself, my witne2s is not true. 
There is another that beareth witne2s of me; and I know that the witne2s which he witne2seth of me is true. 
Ye sent unto John, and he bare witne2s unto the truth. 
But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved. 
He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were wi2ling for a season to rejoice in his light. 
But I have greater witne2s than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witne2s of me, that the Father hath sent me. 
And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witne2s of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor s2en his shape. 
And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. 
Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. 
And ye wi2l not come to me, that ye might have life. 
I receive not honour from men. 
But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. 
I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another sha2l come in his own name, him ye wi2l receive. 
How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and s2ek not the honour that cometh from God only? 
Do not think that I wi2l a2cuse you to the Father: there is one that a2cuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. 
For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me. 
But if ye believe not his writings, how sha2l ye believe my words? 
After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galil2e, which is the sea of Tiberias. 
And a great multitude fo2lowed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased. 
And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. 
And the pa2sover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh. 
When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence sha2l we buy bread, that these may eat? 
And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do. 
Philip answered him, Two hundred pe2nyworth of bread is not su2ficient for them, that every one of them may take a li2tle. 
One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him, 
There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two sma2l fishes: but what are they among so many? 
And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much gra2s in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. 
And Jesus t2ok the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would. 
When they were fi2led, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. 
Therefore they gathered them together, and fi2led twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten. 
Then those men, when they had s2en the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world. 
When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone. 
And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea, 
And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them. 
And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew. 
So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they s2e Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid. 
But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid. 
Then they wi2lingly received him into the ship: and i2mediately the ship was at the land whither they went. 
The day fo2lowing, when the people which st2od on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone; 
(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:) 
When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also t2ok shi2ping, and came to Capernaum, s2eking for Jesus. 
And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Ra2bi, when camest thou hither? 
Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye s2ek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were fi2led. 
Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man sha2l give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed. 
Then said they unto him, What sha2l we do, that we might work the works of God? 
Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. 
They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may s2e, and believe th2e? what dost thou work? 
Our fathers did eat ma2na in the desert; as it is wri2ten, He gave them bread from heaven to eat. 
Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. 
For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. 
Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. 
And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me sha2l never hunger; and he that believeth on me sha2l never thirst. 
But I said unto you, That ye also have s2en me, and believe not. 
A2l that the Father giveth me sha2l come to me; and him that cometh to me I wi2l in no wise cast out. 
For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own wi2l, but the wi2l of him that sent me. 
And this is the Father's wi2l which hath sent me, that of a2l which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. 
And this is the wi2l of him that sent me, that every one which s2eth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I wi2l raise him up at the last day. 
The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven. 
And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven? 
Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves. 
No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I wi2l raise him up at the last day. 
It is wri2ten in the prophets, And they sha2l be a2l taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me. 
Not that any man hath s2en the Father, save he which is of God, he hath s2en the Father. 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. 
I am that bread of life. 
Your fathers did eat ma2na in the wilderne2s, and are dead. 
This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. 
I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he sha2l live for ever: and the bread that I wi2l give is my flesh, which I wi2l give for the life of the world. 
The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? 
Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his bl2od, ye have no life in you. 
Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my bl2od, hath eternal life; and I wi2l raise him up at the last day. 
For my flesh is meat ind2ed, and my bl2od is drink ind2ed. 
He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my bl2od, dwe2leth in me, and I in him. 
As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he sha2l live by me. 
This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat ma2na, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread sha2l live for ever. 
These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum. 
Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it? 
When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this o2fend you? 
What and if ye sha2l s2e the Son of man ascend up where he was before? 
It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life. 
But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the begi2ning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him. 
And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father. 
From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. 
Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Wi2l ye also go away? 
Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom sha2l we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. 
And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God. 
Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? 
He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve. 
After these things Jesus walked in Galil2e: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to ki2l him. 
Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand. 
His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may s2e the works that thou doest. 
For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself s2eketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world. 
For neither did his brethren believe in him. 
Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready. 
The world ca2not hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil. 
Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet fu2l come. 
When he had said these words unto them, he abode sti2l in Galil2e. 
But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. 
Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? 
And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a g2od man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people. 
Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews. 
Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. 
And the Jews marve2led, saying, How knoweth this man le2ters, having never learned? 
Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. 
If any man wi2l do his wi2l, he sha2l know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. 
He that speaketh of himself s2eketh his own glory: but he that s2eketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousne2s is in him. 
Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you k2epeth the law? Why go ye about to ki2l me? 
The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to ki2l th2e? 
Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye a2l marvel. 
Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sa2bath day circumcise a man. 
If a man on the sa2bath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sa2bath day? 
Judge not a2cording to the a2pearance, but judge righteous judgment. 
Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they s2ek to ki2l? 
But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know ind2ed that this is the very Christ? 
Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is. 
Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. 
But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me. 
Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. 
And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, wi2l he do more miracles than these which this man hath done? 
The Pharis2es heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharis2es and the chief priests sent o2ficers to take him. 
Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a li2tle while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me. 
Ye sha2l s2ek me, and sha2l not find me: and where I am, thither ye ca2not come. 
Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither wi2l he go, that we sha2l not find him? wi2l he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? 
What ma2ner of saying is this that he said, Ye sha2l s2ek me, and sha2l not find me: and where I am, thither ye ca2not come? 
In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus st2od and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. 
He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his be2ly sha2l flow rivers of living water. 
(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.) 
Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet. 
Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Sha2l Christ come out of Galil2e? 
Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the s2ed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? 
So there was a division among the people because of him. 
And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him. 
Then came the o2ficers to the chief priests and Pharis2es; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him? 
The o2ficers answered, Never man spake like this man. 
Then answered them the Pharis2es, Are ye also deceived? 
Have any of the rulers or of the Pharis2es believed on him? 
But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed. 
Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,) 
Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth? 
They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galil2e? Search, and l2ok: for out of Galil2e ariseth no prophet. 
And every man went unto his own house. 
Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. 
And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and a2l the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them. 
And the scribes and Pharis2es brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, 
They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. 
Now Moses in the law co2manded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? 
This they said, tempting him, that they might have to a2cuse him. But Jesus st2oped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. 
So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. 
And again he st2oped down, and wrote on the ground. 
And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, begi2ning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. 
When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine a2cusers? hath no man condemned th2e? 
She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn th2e: go, and sin no more. 
Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that fo2loweth me sha2l not walk in darkne2s, but sha2l have the light of life. 
The Pharis2es therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true. 
Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye ca2not te2l whence I come, and whither I go. 
Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man. 
And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. 
It is also wri2ten in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. 
I am one that bear witne2s of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witne2s of me. 
Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also. 
These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come. 
Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye sha2l s2ek me, and sha2l die in your sins: whither I go, ye ca2not come. 
Then said the Jews, Wi2l he ki2l himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye ca2not come. 
And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. 
I said therefore unto you, that ye sha2l die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye sha2l die in your sins. 
Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the begi2ning. 
I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him. 
They underst2od not that he spake to them of the Father. 
Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then sha2l ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. 
And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him. 
As he spake these words, many believed on him. 
Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples ind2ed; 
And ye sha2l know the truth, and the truth sha2l make you fr2e. 
They answered him, We be Abraham's s2ed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye sha2l be made fr2e? 
Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever co2mi2teth sin is the servant of sin. 
And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever. 
If the Son therefore sha2l make you fr2e, ye sha2l be fr2e ind2ed. 
I know that ye are Abraham's s2ed; but ye s2ek to ki2l me, because my word hath no place in you. 
I speak that which I have s2en with my Father: and ye do that which ye have s2en with your father. 
They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. 
But now ye s2ek to ki2l me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. 
Ye do the d2eds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. 
Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proc2eded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. 
Why do ye not understand my sp2ech? even because ye ca2not hear my word. 
Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye wi2l do. He was a murderer from the begi2ning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. 
And because I te2l you the truth, ye believe me not. 
Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me? 
He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God. 
Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not we2l that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? 
Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me. 
And I s2ek not mine own glory: there is one that s2eketh and judgeth. 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man k2ep my saying, he sha2l never s2e death. 
Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man k2ep my saying, he sha2l never taste of death. 
Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself? 
Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: 
Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I sha2l be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and k2ep his saying. 
Your father Abraham rejoiced to s2e my day: and he saw it, and was glad. 
Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou s2en Abraham? 
Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. 
Then t2ok they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so pa2sed by. 
And as Jesus pa2sed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth. 
And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? 
Jesus answered, Neither hath this man si2ned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. 
I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. 
As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. 
When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spi2tle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, 
And said unto him, Go, wash in the p2ol of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came s2eing. 
The neighbours therefore, and they which before had s2en him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and be2ged? 
Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he. 
Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened? 
He answered and said, A man that is ca2led Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the p2ol of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight. 
Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not. 
They brought to the Pharis2es him that aforetime was blind. 
And it was the sa2bath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. 
Then again the Pharis2es also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do s2e. 
Therefore said some of the Pharis2es, This man is not of God, because he k2epeth not the sa2bath day. Others said, How can a man that is a si2ner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. 
They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet. 
But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had b2en blind, and received his sight, until they ca2led the parents of him that had received his sight. 
And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now s2e? 
His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: 
But by what means he now s2eth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he sha2l speak for himself. 
These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agr2ed already, that if any man did confe2s that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. 
Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. 
Then again ca2led they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a si2ner. 
He answered and said, Whether he be a si2ner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I s2e. 
Then said they to him again, What did he to th2e? how opened he thine eyes? 
He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? wi2l ye also be his disciples? 
Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples. 
We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fe2low, we know not from whence he is. 
The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marve2lous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes. 
Now we know that God heareth not si2ners: but if any man be a worshi2per of God, and doeth his wi2l, him he heareth. 
Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. 
If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. 
They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. 
Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? 
He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? 
And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both s2en him, and it is he that talketh with th2e. 
And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshi2ped him. 
And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which s2e not might s2e; and that they which s2e might be made blind. 
And some of the Pharis2es which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also? 
Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We s2e; therefore your sin remaineth. 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the d2or into the sh2epfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a ro2ber. 
But he that entereth in by the d2or is the shepherd of the sh2ep. 
To him the porter openeth; and the sh2ep hear his voice: and he ca2leth his own sh2ep by name, and leadeth them out. 
And when he pu2teth forth his own sh2ep, he goeth before them, and the sh2ep fo2low him: for they know his voice. 
And a stranger wi2l they not fo2low, but wi2l fl2e from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. 
This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they underst2od not what things they were which he spake unto them. 
Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the d2or of the sh2ep. 
A2l that ever came before me are thieves and ro2bers: but the sh2ep did not hear them. 
I am the d2or: by me if any man enter in, he sha2l be saved, and sha2l go in and out, and find pasture. 
The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to ki2l, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. 
I am the g2od shepherd: the g2od shepherd giveth his life for the sh2ep. 
But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sh2ep are not, s2eth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sh2ep, and fl2eth: and the wolf catcheth them, and sca2tereth the sh2ep. 
The hireling fl2eth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sh2ep. 
I am the g2od shepherd, and know my sh2ep, and am known of mine. 
As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sh2ep. 
And other sh2ep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they sha2l hear my voice; and there sha2l be one fold, and one shepherd. 
Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. 
No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This co2mandment have I received of my Father. 
There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings. 
And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? 
Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind? 
And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter. 
And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch. 
Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, te2l us plainly. 
Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witne2s of me. 
But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sh2ep, as I said unto you. 
My sh2ep hear my voice, and I know them, and they fo2low me: 
And I give unto them eternal life; and they sha2l never perish, neither sha2l any man pluck them out of my hand. 
My Father, which gave them me, is greater than a2l; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. 
I and my Father are one. 
Then the Jews t2ok up stones again to stone him. 
Jesus answered them, Many g2od works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? 
The Jews answered him, saying, For a g2od work we stone th2e not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. 
Jesus answered them, Is it not wri2ten in your law, I said, Ye are gods? 
If he ca2led them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture ca2not be broken; 
Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? 
If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. 
But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him. 
Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand, 
And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode. 
And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but a2l things that John spake of this man were true. 
And many believed on him there. 
Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha. 
(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his f2et with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) 
Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. 
When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickne2s is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. 
Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. 
When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days sti2l in the same place where he was. 
Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. 
His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone th2e; and goest thou thither again? 
Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he s2eth the light of this world. 
But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him. 
These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sl2epeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sl2ep. 
Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sl2ep, he sha2l do we2l. 
Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sl2ep. 
Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. 
And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; neverthele2s let us go unto him. 
Then said Thomas, which is ca2led Didymus, unto his fe2lowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. 
Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already. 
Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fift2en furlongs o2f: 
And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. 
Then Martha, as s2on as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat sti2l in the house. 
Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst b2en here, my brother had not died. 
But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God wi2l give it th2e. 
Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother sha2l rise again. 
Martha saith unto him, I know that he sha2l rise again in the resu2rection at the last day. 
Jesus said unto her, I am the resu2rection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet sha2l he live: 
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me sha2l never die. Believest thou this? 
She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world. 
And when she had so said, she went her way, and ca2led Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and ca2leth for th2e. 
As s2on as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him. 
Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. 
The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, fo2lowed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to w2ep there. 
Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fe2l down at his f2et, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst b2en here, my brother had not died. 
When Jesus therefore saw her w2eping, and the Jews also w2eping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled. 
And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and s2e. 
Jesus wept. 
Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! 
And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died? 
Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. 
Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath b2en dead four days. 
Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto th2e, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest s2e the glory of God? 
Then they t2ok away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank th2e that thou hast heard me. 
And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. 
And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. 
And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and f2ot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, L2ose him, and let him go. 
Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had s2en the things which Jesus did, believed on him. 
But some of them went their ways to the Pharis2es, and told them what things Jesus had done. 
Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharis2es a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. 
If we let him thus alone, a2l men wi2l believe on him: and the Romans sha2l come and take away both our place and nation. 
And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at a2l, 
Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. 
And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; 
And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were sca2tered abroad. 
Then from that day forth they t2ok counsel together for to put him to death. 
Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderne2s, into a city ca2led Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples. 
And the Jews' pa2sover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the pa2sover, to purify themselves. 
Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they st2od in the temple, What think ye, that he wi2l not come to the feast? 
Now both the chief priests and the Pharis2es had given a co2mandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him. 
Then Jesus six days before the pa2sover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had b2en dead, whom he raised from the dead. 
There they made him a su2per; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. 
Then t2ok Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the f2et of Jesus, and wiped his f2et with her hair: and the house was fi2led with the odour of the ointment. 
Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him, 
Why was not this ointment sold for thr2e hundred pence, and given to the p2or? 
This he said, not that he cared for the p2or; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. 
Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this. 
For the p2or always ye have with you; but me ye have not always. 
Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might s2e Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. 
But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; 
Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus. 
On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 
T2ok branches of palm tr2es, and went forth to m2et him, and cried, Hosa2na: Ble2sed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord. 
And Jesus, when he had found a young a2s, sat thereon; as it is wri2ten, 
Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, si2ting on an a2s's colt. 
These things underst2od not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were wri2ten of him, and that they had done these things unto him. 
The people therefore that was with him when he ca2led Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record. 
For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle. 
The Pharis2es therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him. 
And there were certain Gr2eks among them that came up to worship at the feast: 
The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galil2e, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would s2e Jesus. 
Philip cometh and te2leth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip te2l Jesus. 
And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fa2l into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. 
He that loveth his life sha2l lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world sha2l k2ep it unto life eternal. 
If any man serve me, let him fo2low me; and where I am, there sha2l also my servant be: if any man serve me, him wi2l my Father honour. 
Now is my soul troubled; and what sha2l I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. 
Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and wi2l glorify it again. 
The people therefore, that st2od by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. 
Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. 
Now is the judgment of this world: now sha2l the prince of this world be cast out. 
And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, wi2l draw a2l men unto me. 
This he said, signifying what death he should die. 
The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man? 
Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a li2tle while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkne2s come upon you: for he that walketh in darkne2s knoweth not whither he goeth. 
While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them. 
But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him: 
That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfi2led, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord b2en revealed? 
Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again, 
He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not s2e with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. 
These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him. 
Neverthele2s among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharis2es they did not confe2s him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: 
For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God. 
Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. 
And he that s2eth me s2eth him that sent me. 
I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkne2s. 
And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. 
He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same sha2l judge him in the last day. 
For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a co2mandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. 
And I know that his co2mandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak. 
Now before the feast of the pa2sover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. 
And su2per being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him; 
Jesus knowing that the Father had given a2l things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; 
He riseth from su2per, and laid aside his garments; and t2ok a towel, and girded himself. 
After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' f2et, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. 
Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my f2et? 
Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. 
Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my f2et. Jesus answered him, If I wash th2e not, thou hast no part with me. 
Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my f2et only, but also my hands and my head. 
Jesus saith to him, He that is washed n2edeth not save to wash his f2et, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not a2l. 
For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not a2l clean. 
So after he had washed their f2et, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? 
Ye ca2l me Master and Lord: and ye say we2l; for so I am. 
If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your f2et; ye also ought to wash one another's f2et. 
For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. 
If ye know these things, ha2py are ye if ye do them. 
I speak not of you a2l: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfi2led, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his h2el against me. 
Now I te2l you before it come, that, when it is come to pa2s, ye may believe that I am he. 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. 
When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you sha2l betray me. 
Then the disciples l2oked one on another, doubting of whom he spake. 
Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. 
Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake. 
He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? 
Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I sha2l give a sop, when I have di2ped it. And when he had di2ped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. 
And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly. 
Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him. 
For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have n2ed of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the p2or. 
He then having received the sop went i2mediately out: and it was night. 
Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. 
If God be glorified in him, God sha2l also glorify him in himself, and sha2l straightway glorify him. 
Li2tle children, yet a li2tle while I am with you. Ye sha2l s2ek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye ca2not come; so now I say to you. 
A new co2mandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. 
By this sha2l a2l men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another. 
Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not fo2low me now; but thou shalt fo2low me afterwards. 
Peter said unto him, Lord, why ca2not I fo2low th2e now? I wi2l lay down my life for thy sake. 
Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto th2e, The cock sha2l not crow, ti2l thou hast denied me thrice. 
Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. 
In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I wi2l come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. 
And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. 
Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? 
Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. 
If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have s2en him. 
Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it su2ficeth us. 
Jesus saith unto him, Have I b2en so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath s2en me hath s2en the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? 
Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwe2leth in me, he doeth the works. 
Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake. 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do sha2l he do also; and greater works than these sha2l he do; because I go unto my Father. 
And whatsoever ye sha2l ask in my name, that wi2l I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 
If ye sha2l ask any thing in my name, I wi2l do it. 
If ye love me, k2ep my co2mandments. 
And I wi2l pray the Father, and he sha2l give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; 
Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world ca2not receive, because it s2eth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwe2leth with you, and sha2l be in you. 
I wi2l not leave you comfortle2s: I wi2l come to you. 
Yet a li2tle while, and the world s2eth me no more; but ye s2e me: because I live, ye sha2l live also. 
At that day ye sha2l know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. 
He that hath my co2mandments, and k2epeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me sha2l be loved of my Father, and I wi2l love him, and wi2l manifest myself to him. 
Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? 
Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he wi2l k2ep my words: and my Father wi2l love him, and we wi2l come unto him, and make our abode with him. 
He that loveth me not k2epeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me. 
These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. 
But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father wi2l send in my name, he sha2l teach you a2l things, and bring a2l things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. 
Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. 
Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I. 
And now I have told you before it come to pa2s, that, when it is come to pa2s, ye might believe. 
Hereafter I wi2l not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. 
But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me co2mandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence. 
I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. 
Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. 
Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. 
Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch ca2not bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. 
I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. 
If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. 
If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye sha2l ask what ye wi2l, and it sha2l be done unto you. 
Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so sha2l ye be my disciples. 
As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. 
If ye k2ep my co2mandments, ye sha2l abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's co2mandments, and abide in his love. 
These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be fu2l. 
This is my co2mandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you. 
Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. 
Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I co2mand you. 
Henceforth I ca2l you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have ca2led you friends; for a2l things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you. 
Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye sha2l ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. 
These things I co2mand you, that ye love one another. 
If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. 
If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. 
Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they wi2l also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they wi2l k2ep yours also. 
But a2l these things wi2l they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me. 
If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin. 
He that hateth me hateth my Father also. 
If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both s2en and hated both me and my Father. 
But this cometh to pa2s, that the word might be fulfi2led that is wri2ten in their law, They hated me without a cause. 
But when the Comforter is come, whom I wi2l send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proc2edeth from the Father, he sha2l testify of me: 
And ye also sha2l bear witne2s, because ye have b2en with me from the begi2ning. 
These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be o2fended. 
They sha2l put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever ki2leth you wi2l think that he doeth God service. 
And these things wi2l they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me. 
But these things have I told you, that when the time sha2l come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the begi2ning, because I was with you. 
But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? 
But because I have said these things unto you, so2row hath fi2led your heart. 
Neverthele2s I te2l you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter wi2l not come unto you; but if I depart, I wi2l send him unto you. 
And when he is come, he wi2l reprove the world of sin, and of righteousne2s, and of judgment: 
Of sin, because they believe not on me; 
Of righteousne2s, because I go to my Father, and ye s2e me no more; 
Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. 
I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye ca2not bear them now. 
Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he wi2l guide you into a2l truth: for he sha2l not speak of himself; but whatsoever he sha2l hear, that sha2l he speak: and he wi2l shew you things to come. 
He sha2l glorify me: for he sha2l receive of mine, and sha2l shew it unto you. 
A2l things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he sha2l take of mine, and sha2l shew it unto you. 
A li2tle while, and ye sha2l not s2e me: and again, a li2tle while, and ye sha2l s2e me, because I go to the Father. 
Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A li2tle while, and ye sha2l not s2e me: and again, a li2tle while, and ye sha2l s2e me: and, Because I go to the Father? 
They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A li2tle while? we ca2not te2l what he saith. 
Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A li2tle while, and ye sha2l not s2e me: and again, a li2tle while, and ye sha2l s2e me? 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye sha2l w2ep and lament, but the world sha2l rejoice: and ye sha2l be so2rowful, but your so2row sha2l be turned into joy. 
A woman when she is in travail hath so2row, because her hour is come: but as s2on as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. 
And ye now therefore have so2row: but I wi2l s2e you again, and your heart sha2l rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you. 
And in that day ye sha2l ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye sha2l ask the Father in my name, he wi2l give it you. 
Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye sha2l receive, that your joy may be fu2l. 
These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I sha2l no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I sha2l shew you plainly of the Father. 
At that day ye sha2l ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I wi2l pray the Father for you: 
For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. 
I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father. 
His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb. 
Now are we sure that thou knowest a2l things, and n2edest not that any man should ask th2e: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God. 
Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? 
Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye sha2l be sca2tered, every man to his own, and sha2l leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. 
These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye sha2l have tribulation: but be of g2od ch2er; I have overcome the world. 
These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify th2e: 
As thou hast given him power over a2l flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him. 
And this is life eternal, that they might know th2e the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. 
I have glorified th2e on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. 
And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with th2e before the world was. 
I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word. 
Now they have known that a2l things whatsoever thou hast given me are of th2e. 
For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from th2e, and they have believed that thou didst send me. 
I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. 
And a2l mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. 
And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to th2e. Holy Father, k2ep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. 
While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfi2led. 
And now come I to th2e; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfi2led in themselves. 
I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest k2ep them from the evil. 
They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 
Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. 
As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. 
And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. 
Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which sha2l believe on me through their word; 
That they a2l may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in th2e, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. 
And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: 
I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. 
Father, I wi2l that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. 
O righteous Father, the world hath not known th2e: but I have known th2e, and these have known that thou hast sent me. 
And I have declared unto them thy name, and wi2l declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them. 
When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the br2ok Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples. 
And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus of2times resorted thither with his disciples. 
Judas then, having received a band of men and o2ficers from the chief priests and Pharis2es, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons. 
Jesus therefore, knowing a2l things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom s2ek ye? 
They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, st2od with them. 
As s2on then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fe2l to the ground. 
Then asked he them again, Whom s2ek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. 
Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye s2ek me, let these go their way: 
That the saying might be fulfi2led, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none. 
Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut o2f his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus. 
Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, sha2l I not drink it? 
Then the band and the captain and o2ficers of the Jews t2ok Jesus, and bound him, 
And led him away to A2nas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year. 
Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people. 
And Simon Peter fo2lowed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest. 
But Peter st2od at the d2or without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the d2or, and brought in Peter. 
Then saith the damsel that kept the d2or unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not. 
And the servants and o2ficers st2od there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter st2od with them, and warmed himself. 
The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine. 
Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing. 
Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said. 
And when he had thus spoken, one of the o2ficers which st2od by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? 
Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witne2s of the evil: but if we2l, why smitest thou me? 
Now A2nas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest. 
And Simon Peter st2od and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not. 
One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut o2f, saith, Did not I s2e th2e in the garden with him? 
Peter then denied again: and i2mediately the cock crew. 
Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the ha2l of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment ha2l, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the pa2sover. 
Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What a2cusation bring ye against this man? 
They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto th2e. 
Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him a2cording to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: 
That the saying of Jesus might be fulfi2led, which he spake, signifying what death he should die. 
Then Pilate entered into the judgment ha2l again, and ca2led Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? 
Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others te2l it th2e of me? 
Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered th2e unto me: what hast thou done? 
Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence. 
Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witne2s unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. 
Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at a2l. 
But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the pa2sover: wi2l ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews? 
Then cried they a2l again, saying, Not this man, but Bara2bas. Now Bara2bas was a ro2ber. 
Then Pilate therefore t2ok Jesus, and scourged him. 
And the soldiers pla2ted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe, 
And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands. 
Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him. 
Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man! 
When the chief priests therefore and o2ficers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him. 
The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. 
When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid; 
And went again into the judgment ha2l, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. 
Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify th2e, and have power to release th2e? 
Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at a2l against me, except it were given th2e from above: therefore he that delivered me unto th2e hath the greater sin. 
And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar. 
When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is ca2led the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Ga2batha. 
And it was the preparation of the pa2sover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King! 
But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Sha2l I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar. 
Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they t2ok Jesus, and led him away. 
And he bearing his cro2s went forth into a place ca2led the place of a sku2l, which is ca2led in the Hebrew Golgotha: 
Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst. 
And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cro2s. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was wri2ten in Hebrew, and Gr2ek, and Latin. 
Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 
Pilate answered, What I have wri2ten I have wri2ten. 
Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, t2ok his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. 
They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it sha2l be: that the scripture might be fulfi2led, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did. 
Now there st2od by the cro2s of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. 
When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son! 
Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple t2ok her unto his own home. 
After this, Jesus knowing that a2l things were now a2complished, that the scripture might be fulfi2led, saith, I thirst. 
Now there was set a ve2sel fu2l of vinegar: and they fi2led a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hy2sop, and put it to his mouth. 
When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost. 
The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cro2s on the sa2bath day, (for that sa2bath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. 
Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him. 
But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs: 
But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out bl2od and water. 
And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe. 
For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfi2led, A bone of him sha2l not be broken. 
And again another scripture saith, They sha2l l2ok on him whom they pierced. 
And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and t2ok the body of Jesus. 
And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of my2rh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. 
Then t2ok they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the ma2ner of the Jews is to bury. 
Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. 
There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand. 
The first day of the w2ek cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and s2eth the stone taken away from the sepulchre. 
Then she ru2neth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him. 
Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre. 
So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre. 
And he st2oping down, and l2oking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in. 
Then cometh Simon Peter fo2lowing him, and went into the sepulchre, and s2eth the linen clothes lie, 
And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wra2ped together in a place by itself. 
Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed. 
For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead. 
Then the disciples went away again unto their own home. 
But Mary st2od without at the sepulchre w2eping: and as she wept, she st2oped down, and l2oked into the sepulchre, 
And s2eth two angels in white si2ting, the one at the head, and the other at the f2et, where the body of Jesus had lain. 
And they say unto her, Woman, why w2epest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid him. 
And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. 
Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why w2epest thou? whom s2ekest thou? She, su2posing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, te2l me where thou hast laid him, and I wi2l take him away. 
Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Ra2boni; which is to say, Master. 
Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God. 
Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had s2en the LORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her. 
Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the w2ek, when the d2ors were shut where the disciples were a2sembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and st2od in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. 
And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD. 
Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you. 
And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: 
Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remi2ted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained. 
But Thomas, one of the twelve, ca2led Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. 
The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have s2en the LORD. But he said unto them, Except I sha2l s2e in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I wi2l not believe. 
And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the d2ors being shut, and st2od in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. 
Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithle2s, but believing. 
And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God. 
Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast s2en me, thou hast believed: ble2sed are they that have not s2en, and yet have believed. 
And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not wri2ten in this b2ok: 
But these are wri2ten, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name. 
After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself. 
There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas ca2led Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galil2e, and the sons of Zebed2e, and two other of his disciples. 
Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with th2e. They went forth, and entered into a ship i2mediately; and that night they caught nothing. 
But when the morning was now come, Jesus st2od on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. 
Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No. 
And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye sha2l find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. 
Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea. 
And the other disciples came in a li2tle ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dra2ging the net with fishes. 
As s2on then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread. 
Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught. 
Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land fu2l of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and thr2e: and for a2l there were so many, yet was not the net broken. 
Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. 
Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise. 
This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead. 
So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love th2e. He saith unto him, F2ed my lambs. 
He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love th2e. He saith unto him, F2ed my sh2ep. 
He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest a2l things; thou knowest that I love th2e. Jesus saith unto him, F2ed my sh2ep. 
Verily, verily, I say unto th2e, When thou wast young, thou girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another sha2l gird th2e, and ca2ry th2e whither thou wouldest not. 
This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Fo2low me. 
Then Peter, turning about, s2eth the disciple whom Jesus loved fo2lowing; which also leaned on his breast at su2per, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth th2e? 
Peter s2eing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what sha2l this man do? 
Jesus saith unto him, If I wi2l that he ta2ry ti2l I come, what is that to th2e? fo2low thou me. 
Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He sha2l not die; but, If I wi2l that he ta2ry ti2l I come, what is that to th2e? 
This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true. 
And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be wri2ten every one, I su2pose that even the world itself could not contain the b2oks that should be wri2ten. Amen. 
The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of a2l that Jesus began both to do and teach, 
Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given co2mandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen: 
To whom also he shewed himself alive after his pa2sion by many infa2lible pr2ofs, being s2en of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God: 
And, being a2sembled together with them, co2manded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me. 
For John truly baptized with water; but ye sha2l be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence. 
When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? 
And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power. 
But ye sha2l receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye sha2l be witne2ses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in a2l Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the u2termost part of the earth. 
And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. 
And while they l2oked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men st2od by them in white a2parel; 
Which also said, Ye men of Galil2e, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, sha2l so come in like ma2ner as ye have s2en him go into heaven. 
Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount ca2led Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sa2bath day's journey. 
And when they were come in, they went up into an u2per r2om, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Ma2thew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. 
These a2l continued with one a2cord in prayer and su2plication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren. 
And in those days Peter st2od up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,) 
Men and brethren, this scripture must n2eds have b2en fulfi2led, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that t2ok Jesus. 
For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry. 
Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and fa2ling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and a2l his bowels gushed out. 
And it was known unto a2l the dwe2lers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is ca2led in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of bl2od. 
For it is wri2ten in the b2ok of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwe2l therein: and his bishoprick let another take. 
Wherefore of these men which have companied with us a2l the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, 
Begi2ning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witne2s with us of his resu2rection. 
And they a2pointed two, Joseph ca2led Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Ma2thias. 
And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of a2l men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen, 
That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgre2sion fe2l, that he might go to his own place. 
And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fe2l upon Ma2thias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles. 
And when the day of Pentecost was fu2ly come, they were a2l with one a2cord in one place. 
And su2denly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it fi2led a2l the house where they were si2ting. 
And there a2peared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. 
And they were a2l fi2led with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them u2terance. 
And there were dwe2ling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. 
Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language. 
And they were a2l amazed and marve2led, saying one to another, Behold, are not a2l these which speak Galilaeans? 
And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born? 
Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwe2lers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Ca2padocia, in Pontus, and Asia, 
Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, 
Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God. 
And they were a2l amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this? 
Others mocking said, These men are fu2l of new wine. 
But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and a2l ye that dwe2l at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words: 
For these are not drunken, as ye su2pose, s2eing it is but the third hour of the day. 
But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; 
And it sha2l come to pa2s in the last days, saith God, I wi2l pour out of my Spirit upon a2l flesh: and your sons and your daughters sha2l prophesy, and your young men sha2l s2e visions, and your old men sha2l dream dreams: 
And on my servants and on my handmaidens I wi2l pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they sha2l prophesy: 
And I wi2l shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; bl2od, and fire, and vapour of smoke: 
The sun sha2l be turned into darkne2s, and the m2on into bl2od, before the great and notable day of the Lord come: 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that whosoever sha2l ca2l on the name of the Lord sha2l be saved. 
Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man a2proved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: 
Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain: 
Whom God hath raised up, having l2osed the pains of death: because it was not po2sible that he should be holden of it. 
For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved: 
Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh sha2l rest in hope: 
Because thou wilt not leave my soul in he2l, neither wilt thou su2fer thine Holy One to s2e co2ruption. 
Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me fu2l of joy with thy countenance. 
Men and brethren, let me fr2ely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. 
Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, a2cording to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; 
He s2eing this before spake of the resu2rection of Christ, that his soul was not left in he2l, neither his flesh did s2e co2ruption. 
This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we a2l are witne2ses. 
Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now s2e and hear. 
For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 
Until I make thy foes thy f2otst2ol. 
Therefore let a2l the house of Israel know a2suredly, that God hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. 
Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what sha2l we do? 
Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remi2sion of sins, and ye sha2l receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. 
For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to a2l that are afar o2f, even as many as the LORD our God sha2l ca2l. 
And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation. 
Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were a2ded unto them about thr2e thousand souls. 
And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fe2lowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. 
And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles. 
And a2l that believed were together, and had a2l things co2mon; 
And sold their po2se2sions and g2ods, and parted them to a2l men, as every man had n2ed. 
And they, continuing daily with one a2cord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladne2s and singlene2s of heart, 
Praising God, and having favour with a2l the people. And the Lord a2ded to the church daily such as should be saved. 
Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour. 
And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was ca2ried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is ca2led Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; 
Who s2eing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms. 
And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, L2ok on us. 
And he gave h2ed unto them, expecting to receive something of them. 
Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I th2e: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. 
And he t2ok him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and i2mediately his f2et and ankle bones received strength. 
And he leaping up st2od, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. 
And a2l the people saw him walking and praising God: 
And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were fi2led with wonder and amazement at that which had ha2pened unto him. 
And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, a2l the people ran together unto them in the porch that is ca2led Solomon's, greatly wondering. 
And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why l2ok ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holine2s we had made this man to walk? 
The God of Abraham, and of Is2ac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go. 
But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you; 
And ki2led the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witne2ses. 
And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye s2e and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundne2s in the presence of you a2l. 
And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers. 
But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of a2l his prophets, that Christ should su2fer, he hath so fulfi2led. 
Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blo2ted out, when the times of refreshing sha2l come from the presence of the Lord. 
And he sha2l send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: 
Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of a2l things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of a2l his holy prophets since the world began. 
For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet sha2l the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him sha2l ye hear in a2l things whatsoever he sha2l say unto you. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that every soul, which wi2l not hear that prophet, sha2l be destroyed from among the people. 
Yea, and a2l the prophets from Samuel and those that fo2low after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days. 
Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy s2ed sha2l a2l the kindreds of the earth be ble2sed. 
Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to ble2s you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities. 
And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sa2duc2es, came upon them, 
Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resu2rection from the dead. 
And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide. 
Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand. 
And it came to pa2s on the mo2row, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes, 
And A2nas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem. 
And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this? 
Then Peter, fi2led with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel, 
If we this day be examined of the g2od d2ed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole; 
Be it known unto you a2l, and to a2l the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. 
This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. 
Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. 
Now when they saw the boldne2s of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marve2led; and they t2ok knowledge of them, that they had b2en with Jesus. 
And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it. 
But when they had co2manded them to go aside out of the council, they confe2red among themselves, 
Saying, What sha2l we do to these men? for that ind2ed a notable miracle hath b2en done by them is manifest to a2l them that dwe2l in Jerusalem; and we ca2not deny it. 
But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. 
And they ca2led them, and co2manded them not to speak at a2l nor teach in the name of Jesus. 
But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. 
For we ca2not but speak the things which we have s2en and heard. 
So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for a2l men glorified God for that which was done. 
For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed. 
And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported a2l that the chief priests and elders had said unto them. 
And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one a2cord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and a2l that in them is: 
Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? 
The kings of the earth st2od up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ. 
For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together, 
For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done. 
And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with a2l boldne2s they may speak thy word, 
By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus. 
And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were a2sembled together; and they were a2l fi2led with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldne2s. 
And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he po2se2sed was his own; but they had a2l things co2mon. 
And with great power gave the apostles witne2s of the resu2rection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them a2l. 
Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were po2se2sors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, 
And laid them down at the apostles' f2et: and distribution was made unto every man a2cording as he had n2ed. 
And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus, 
Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles' f2et. 
But a certain man named Ananias, with Sa2phira his wife, sold a po2se2sion, 
And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' f2et. 
But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan fi2led thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to k2ep back part of the price of the land? 
Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God. 
And Ananias hearing these words fe2l down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on a2l them that heard these things. 
And the young men arose, wound him up, and ca2ried him out, and buried him. 
And it was about the space of thr2e hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in. 
And Peter answered unto her, Te2l me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much. 
Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agr2ed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the f2et of them which have buried thy husband are at the d2or, and sha2l ca2ry th2e out. 
Then fe2l she down straightway at his f2et, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, ca2rying her forth, buried her by her husband. 
And great fear came upon a2l the church, and upon as many as heard these things. 
And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were a2l with one a2cord in Solomon's porch. 
And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them. 
And believers were the more a2ded to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.) 
Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the str2ets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter pa2sing by might overshadow some of them. 
There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one. 
Then the high priest rose up, and a2l they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sa2duc2es,) and were fi2led with indignation, 
And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the co2mon prison. 
But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison d2ors, and brought them forth, and said, 
Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people a2l the words of this life. 
And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and ca2led the council together, and a2l the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought. 
But when the o2ficers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned and told, 
Saying, The prison truly found we shut with a2l safety, and the k2epers standing without before the d2ors: but when we had opened, we found no man within. 
Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow. 
Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people. 
Then went the captain with the o2ficers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have b2en stoned. 
And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them, 
Saying, Did not we straitly co2mand you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have fi2led Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's bl2od upon us. 
Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men. 
The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tr2e. 
Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgivene2s of sins. 
And we are his witne2ses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. 
When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and t2ok counsel to slay them. 
Then st2od there up one in the council, a Pharis2e, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among a2l the people, and co2manded to put the apostles forth a li2tle space; 
And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take h2ed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men. 
For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and a2l, as many as obeyed him, were sca2tered, and brought to nought. 
After this man rose up Judas of Galil2e in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and a2l, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed. 
And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it wi2l come to nought: 
But if it be of God, ye ca2not overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God. 
And to him they agr2ed: and when they had ca2led the apostles, and beaten them, they co2manded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. 
And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to su2fer shame for his name. 
And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ. 
And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration. 
Then the twelve ca2led the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables. 
Wherefore, brethren, l2ok ye out among you seven men of honest report, fu2l of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may a2point over this busine2s. 
But we wi2l give ourselves continua2ly to prayer, and to the ministry of the word. 
And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man fu2l of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: 
Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them. 
And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith. 
And Stephen, fu2l of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people. 
Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is ca2led the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen. 
And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake. 
Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God. 
And they sti2red up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council, 
And set up false witne2ses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law: 
For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth sha2l destroy this place, and sha2l change the customs which Moses delivered us. 
And a2l that sat in the council, l2oking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had b2en the face of an angel. 
Then said the high priest, Are these things so? 
And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory a2peared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Cha2ran, 
And said unto him, Get th2e out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I sha2l shew th2e. 
Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Cha2ran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwe2l. 
And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his f2ot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a po2se2sion, and to his s2ed after him, when as yet he had no child. 
And God spake on this wise, That his s2ed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years. 
And the nation to whom they sha2l be in bondage wi2l I judge, said God: and after that sha2l they come forth, and serve me in this place. 
And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Is2ac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Is2ac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs. 
And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him, 
And delivered him out of a2l his a2flictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and a2l his house. 
Now there came a dearth over a2l the land of Egypt and Chan2an, and great a2fliction: and our fathers found no sustenance. 
But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first. 
And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh. 
Then sent Joseph, and ca2led his father Jacob to him, and a2l his kindred, thr2escore and fift2en souls. 
So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers, 
And were ca2ried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of E2mor the father of Sychem. 
But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, 
Ti2l another king arose, which knew not Joseph. 
The same dealt subti2ly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live. 
In which time Moses was born, and was exc2eding fair, and nourished up in his father's house thr2e months: 
And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter t2ok him up, and nourished him for her own son. 
And Moses was learned in a2l the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in d2eds. 
And when he was fu2l forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel. 
And s2eing one of them su2fer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was o2pre2sed, and smote the Egyptian: 
For he su2posed his brethren would have underst2od how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they underst2od not. 
And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another? 
But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made th2e a ruler and a judge over us? 
Wilt thou ki2l me, as thou di2dest the Egyptian yesterday? 
Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons. 
And when forty years were expired, there a2peared to him in the wilderne2s of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush. 
When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the LORD came unto him, 
Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Is2ac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold. 
Then said the Lord to him, Put o2f thy shoes from thy f2et: for the place where thou standest is holy ground. 
I have s2en, I have s2en the a2fliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I wi2l send th2e into Egypt. 
This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made th2e a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which a2peared to him in the bush. 
He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderne2s forty years. 
This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet sha2l the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him sha2l ye hear. 
This is he, that was in the church in the wilderne2s with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us: 
To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt, 
Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. 
And they made a calf in those days, and o2fered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands. 
Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is wri2ten in the b2ok of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye o2fered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderne2s? 
Yea, ye t2ok up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I wi2l ca2ry you away beyond Babylon. 
Our fathers had the tabernacle of witne2s in the wilderne2s, as he had a2pointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it a2cording to the fashion that he had s2en. 
Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the po2se2sion of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David; 
Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. 
But Solomon built him an house. 
Howbeit the most High dwe2leth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet, 
Heaven is my throne, and earth is my f2otst2ol: what house wi2l ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest? 
Hath not my hand made a2l these things? 
Ye sti2fnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye. 
Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have b2en now the betrayers and murderers: 
Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it. 
When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their t2eth. 
But he, being fu2l of the Holy Ghost, l2oked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, 
And said, Behold, I s2e the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God. 
Then they cried out with a loud voice, and sto2ped their ears, and ran upon him with one a2cord, 
And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witne2ses laid down their clothes at a young man's f2et, whose name was Saul. 
And they stoned Stephen, ca2ling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. 
And he kn2eled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fe2l asl2ep. 
And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were a2l sca2tered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles. 
And devout men ca2ried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him. 
As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women co2mi2ted them to prison. 
Therefore they that were sca2tered abroad went every where preaching the word. 
Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them. 
And the people with one a2cord gave h2ed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and s2eing the miracles which he did. 
For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were po2se2sed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed. 
And there was great joy in that city. 
But there was a certain man, ca2led Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one: 
To whom they a2l gave h2ed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God. 
And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. 
But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. 
Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done. 
Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: 
Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: 
(For as yet he was fa2len upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) 
Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost. 
And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he o2fered them money, 
Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. 
But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with th2e, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. 
Thou hast neither part nor lot in this ma2ter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God. 
Repent therefore of this thy wickedne2s, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven th2e. 
For I perceive that thou art in the ga2l of bi2terne2s, and in the bond of iniquity. 
Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me. 
And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many vi2lages of the Samaritans. 
And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert. 
And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace qu2en of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of a2l her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship, 
Was returning, and si2ting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet. 
Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. 
And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? 
And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. 
The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sh2ep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth: 
In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who sha2l declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth. 
And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray th2e, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man? 
Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. 
And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, S2e, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? 
And Philip said, If thou believest with a2l thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. 
And he co2manded the chariot to stand sti2l: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. 
And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing. 
But Philip was found at Azotus: and pa2sing through he preached in a2l the cities, ti2l he came to Caesarea. 
And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, 
And desired of him le2ters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem. 
And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and su2denly there shined round about him a light from heaven: 
And he fe2l to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 
And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for th2e to kick against the pricks. 
And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it sha2l be told th2e what thou must do. 
And the men which journeyed with him st2od sp2echle2s, hearing a voice, but s2eing no man. 
And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. 
And he was thr2e days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink. 
And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord. 
And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the str2et which is ca2led Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one ca2led Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth, 
And hath s2en in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and pu2ting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight. 
Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem: 
And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind a2l that ca2l on thy name. 
But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen ve2sel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel: 
For I wi2l shew him how great things he must su2fer for my name's sake. 
And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and pu2ting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that a2peared unto th2e in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be fi2led with the Holy Ghost. 
And i2mediately there fe2l from his eyes as it had b2en scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized. 
And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus. 
And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God. 
But a2l that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which ca2led on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests? 
But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ. 
And after that many days were fulfi2led, the Jews t2ok counsel to ki2l him: 
But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to ki2l him. 
Then the disciples t2ok him by night, and let him down by the wa2l in a basket. 
And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he a2sayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were a2l afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple. 
But Barnabas t2ok him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had s2en the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus. 
And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem. 
And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him. 
Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus. 
Then had the churches rest throughout a2l Judaea and Galil2e and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied. 
And it came to pa2s, as Peter pa2sed throughout a2l quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Ly2da. 
And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy. 
And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh th2e whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose i2mediately. 
And a2l that dwelt at Ly2da and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord. 
Now there was at Jo2pa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is ca2led Dorcas: this woman was fu2l of g2od works and almsd2eds which she did. 
And it came to pa2s in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an u2per chamber. 
And forasmuch as Ly2da was nigh to Jo2pa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them. 
Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the u2per chamber: and a2l the widows st2od by him w2eping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them. 
But Peter put them a2l forth, and kn2eled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up. 
And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had ca2led the saints and widows, presented her alive. 
And it was known throughout a2l Jo2pa; and many believed in the Lord. 
And it came to pa2s, that he ta2ried many days in Jo2pa with one Simon a ta2ner. 
There was a certain man in Caesarea ca2led Cornelius, a centurion of the band ca2led the Italian band, 
A devout man, and one that feared God with a2l his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway. 
He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius. 
And when he l2oked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. 
And now send men to Jo2pa, and ca2l for one Simon, whose surname is Peter: 
He lodgeth with one Simon a ta2ner, whose house is by the sea side: he sha2l te2l th2e what thou oughtest to do. 
And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he ca2led two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continua2ly; 
And when he had declared a2l these things unto them, he sent them to Jo2pa. 
On the mo2row, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour: 
And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fe2l into a trance, 
And saw heaven opened, and a certain ve2sel descending upon him, as it had b2en a great sh2et knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth: 
Wherein were a2l ma2ner of fourf2oted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and cr2eping things, and fowls of the air. 
And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; ki2l, and eat. 
But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is co2mon or unclean. 
And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that ca2l not thou co2mon. 
This was done thrice: and the ve2sel was received up again into heaven. 
Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had s2en should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and st2od before the gate, 
And ca2led, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there. 
While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, thr2e men s2ek th2e. 
Arise therefore, and get th2e down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them. 
Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye s2ek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come? 
And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of g2od report among a2l the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for th2e into his house, and to hear words of th2e. 
Then ca2led he them in, and lodged them. And on the mo2row Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Jo2pa a2companied him. 
And the mo2row after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and he had ca2led together his kinsmen and near friends. 
And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fe2l down at his f2et, and worshi2ped him. 
But Peter t2ok him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man. 
And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together. 
And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to k2ep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not ca2l any man co2mon or unclean. 
Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as s2on as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me? 
And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man st2od before me in bright clothing, 
And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God. 
Send therefore to Jo2pa, and ca2l hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a ta2ner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, sha2l speak unto th2e. 
I2mediately therefore I sent to th2e; and thou hast we2l done that thou art come. Now therefore are we a2l here present before God, to hear a2l things that are co2manded th2e of God. 
Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: 
But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousne2s, is a2cepted with him. 
The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of a2l:) 
That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout a2l Judaea, and began from Galil2e, after the baptism which John preached; 
How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing g2od, and healing a2l that were o2pre2sed of the devil; for God was with him. 
And we are witne2ses of a2l things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tr2e: 
Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; 
Not to a2l the people, but unto witne2ses chosen before God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead. 
And he co2manded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. 
To him give a2l the prophets witne2s, that through his name whosoever believeth in him sha2l receive remi2sion of sins. 
While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fe2l on a2l them which heard the word. 
And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost. 
For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter, 
Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as we2l as we? 
And he co2manded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to ta2ry certain days. 
And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God. 
And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him, 
Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them. 
But Peter rehearsed the ma2ter from the begi2ning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying, 
I was in the city of Jo2pa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain ve2sel descend, as it had b2en a great sh2et, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me: 
Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourf2oted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and cr2eping things, and fowls of the air. 
And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat. 
But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing co2mon or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth. 
But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, that ca2l not thou co2mon. 
And this was done thr2e times: and a2l were drawn up again into heaven. 
And, behold, i2mediately there were thr2e men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me. 
And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren a2companied me, and we entered into the man's house: 
And he shewed us how he had s2en an angel in his house, which st2od and said unto him, Send men to Jo2pa, and ca2l for Simon, whose surname is Peter; 
Who sha2l te2l th2e words, whereby thou and a2l thy house sha2l be saved. 
And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fe2l on them, as on us at the begi2ning. 
Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John ind2ed baptized with water; but ye sha2l be baptized with the Holy Ghost. 
Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God? 
When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life. 
Now they which were sca2tered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen trave2led as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only. 
And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus. 
And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord. 
Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch. 
Who, when he came, and had s2en the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them a2l, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord. 
For he was a g2od man, and fu2l of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was a2ded unto the Lord. 
Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to s2ek Saul: 
And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pa2s, that a whole year they a2sembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were ca2led Christians first in Antioch. 
And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch. 
And there st2od up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout a2l the world: which came to pa2s in the days of Claudius Caesar. 
Then the disciples, every man a2cording to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea: 
Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul. 
Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church. 
And he ki2led James the brother of John with the sword. 
And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proc2eded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.) 
And when he had a2prehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to k2ep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. 
Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him. 
And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sl2eping betw2en two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the k2epers before the d2or kept the prison. 
And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fe2l o2f from his hands. 
And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about th2e, and fo2low me. 
And he went out, and fo2lowed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision. 
When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own a2cord: and they went out, and pa2sed on through one str2et; and forthwith the angel departed from him. 
And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the LORD hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from a2l the expectation of the people of the Jews. 
And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying. 
And as Peter knocked at the d2or of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda. 
And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladne2s, but ran in, and told how Peter st2od before the gate. 
And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly a2firmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel. 
But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the d2or, and saw him, they were astonished. 
But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place. 
Now as s2on as it was day, there was no sma2l stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter. 
And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the k2epers, and co2manded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode. 
And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one a2cord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country. 
And upon a set day Herod, a2rayed in royal a2parel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them. 
And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man. 
And i2mediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost. 
But the word of God grew and multiplied. 
And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfi2led their ministry, and t2ok with them John, whose surname was Mark. 
Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was ca2led Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had b2en brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. 
As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have ca2led them. 
And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away. 
So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus. 
And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister. 
And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus: 
Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who ca2led for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God. 
But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withst2od them, s2eking to turn away the deputy from the faith. 
Then Saul, (who also is ca2led Paul,) fi2led with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him. 
And said, O fu2l of a2l subtilty and a2l mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of a2l righteousne2s, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? 
And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon th2e, and thou shalt be blind, not s2eing the sun for a season. And i2mediately there fe2l on him a mist and a darkne2s; and he went about s2eking some to lead him by the hand. 
Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord. 
Now when Paul and his company l2osed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem. 
But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sa2bath day, and sat down. 
And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on. 
Then Paul st2od up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience. 
The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it. 
And about the time of forty years su2fered he their ma2ners in the wilderne2s. 
And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chan2an, he divided their land to them by lot. 
And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet. 
And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years. 
And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave their testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Je2se, a man after mine own heart, which sha2l fulfil a2l my wi2l. 
Of this man's s2ed hath God a2cording to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus: 
When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to a2l the people of Israel. 
And as John fulfi2led his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his f2et I am not worthy to l2ose. 
Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent. 
For they that dwe2l at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sa2bath day, they have fulfi2led them in condemning him. 
And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain. 
And when they had fulfi2led a2l that was wri2ten of him, they t2ok him down from the tr2e, and laid him in a sepulchre. 
But God raised him from the dead: 
And he was s2en many days of them which came up with him from Galil2e to Jerusalem, who are his witne2ses unto the people. 
And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers, 
God hath fulfi2led the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also wri2ten in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I bego2ten th2e. 
And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to co2ruption, he said on this wise, I wi2l give you the sure mercies of David. 
Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not su2fer thine Holy One to s2e co2ruption. 
For David, after he had served his own generation by the wi2l of God, fe2l on sl2ep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw co2ruption: 
But he, whom God raised again, saw no co2ruption. 
Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgivene2s of sins: 
And by him a2l that believe are justified from a2l things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. 
Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets; 
Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye sha2l in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you. 
And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sa2bath. 
Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes fo2lowed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. 
And the next sa2bath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God. 
But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were fi2led with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming. 
Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was nece2sary that the word of God should first have b2en spoken to you: but s2eing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. 
For so hath the Lord co2manded us, saying, I have set th2e to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth. 
And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed. 
And the word of the Lord was published throughout a2l the region. 
But the Jews sti2red up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expe2led them out of their coasts. 
But they sh2ok o2f the dust of their f2et against them, and came unto Iconium. 
And the disciples were fi2led with joy, and with the Holy Ghost. 
And it came to pa2s in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Gr2eks believed. 
But the unbelieving Jews sti2red up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil a2fected against the brethren. 
Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands. 
But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles. 
And when there was an a2sault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefu2ly, and to stone them, 
They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about: 
And there they preached the gospel. 
And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his f2et, being a cri2ple from his mother's womb, who never had walked: 
The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, 
Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy f2et. And he leaped and walked. 
And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the sp2ech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likene2s of men. 
And they ca2led Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker. 
Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people. 
Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, 
And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like pa2sions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and a2l things that are therein: 
Who in times past su2fered a2l nations to walk in their own ways. 
Neverthele2s he left not himself without witne2s, in that he did g2od, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, fi2ling our hearts with f2od and gladne2s. 
And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them. 
And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, su2posing he had b2en dead. 
Howbeit, as the disciples st2od round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe. 
And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch, 
Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. 
And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they co2mended them to the Lord, on whom they believed. 
And after they had pa2sed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia. 
And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into A2talia: 
And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had b2en reco2mended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfi2led. 
And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed a2l that God had done with them, and how he had opened the d2or of faith unto the Gentiles. 
And there they abode long time with the disciples. 
And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the ma2ner of Moses, ye ca2not be saved. 
When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no sma2l di2sension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question. 
And being brought on their way by the church, they pa2sed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto a2l the brethren. 
And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared a2l things that God had done with them. 
But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharis2es which believed, saying, That it was n2edful to circumcise them, and to co2mand them to k2ep the law of Moses. 
And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this ma2ter. 
And when there had b2en much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a g2od while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. 
And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witne2s, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; 
And put no di2ference betw2en us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. 
Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? 
But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we sha2l be saved, even as they. 
Then a2l the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them. 
And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me: 
Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. 
And to this agr2e the words of the prophets; as it is wri2ten, 
After this I wi2l return, and wi2l build again the tabernacle of David, which is fa2len down; and I wi2l build again the ruins thereof, and I wi2l set it up: 
That the residue of men might s2ek after the Lord, and a2l the Gentiles, upon whom my name is ca2led, saith the Lord, who doeth a2l these things. 
Known unto God are a2l his works from the begi2ning of the world. 
Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: 
But that we write unto them, that they abstain from po2lutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from bl2od. 
For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sa2bath day. 
Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brethren: 
And they wrote le2ters by them after this ma2ner; The apostles and elders and brethren send gr2eting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia. 
Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and k2ep the law: to whom we gave no such co2mandment: 
It s2emed g2od unto us, being a2sembled with one a2cord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, 
Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who sha2l also te2l you the same things by mouth. 
For it s2emed g2od to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these nece2sary things; 
That ye abstain from meats o2fered to idols, and from bl2od, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye k2ep yourselves, ye sha2l do we2l. Fare ye we2l. 
So when they were dismi2sed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle: 
Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation. 
And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them. 
And after they had ta2ried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles. 
Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there sti2l. 
Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. 
And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and s2e how they do. 
And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark. 
But Paul thought not g2od to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. 
And the contention was so sharp betw2en them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas t2ok Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus; 
And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being reco2mended by the brethren unto the grace of God. 
And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches. 
Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewe2s, and believed; but his father was a Gr2ek: 
Which was we2l reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium. 
Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and t2ok and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew a2l that his father was a Gr2ek. 
And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decr2es for to k2ep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem. 
And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily. 
Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbi2den of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia, 
After they were come to Mysia, they a2sayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit su2fered them not. 
And they pa2sing by Mysia came down to Troas. 
And a vision a2peared to Paul in the night; There st2od a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us. 
And after he had s2en the vision, i2mediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, a2suredly gathering that the Lord had ca2led us for to preach the gospel unto them. 
Therefore l2osing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis; 
And from thence to Phili2pi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days. 
And on the sa2bath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither. 
And a certain woman named Lydia, a se2ler of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshi2ped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she a2tended unto the things which were spoken of Paul. 
And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us. 
And it came to pa2s, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel po2se2sed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by s2othsaying: 
The same fo2lowed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation. 
And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I co2mand th2e in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour. 
And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers, 
And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exc2edingly trouble our city, 
And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans. 
And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent o2f their clothes, and co2manded to beat them. 
And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to k2ep them safely: 
Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the i2ner prison, and made their f2et fast in the stocks. 
And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them. 
And su2denly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and i2mediately a2l the d2ors were opened, and every one's bands were l2osed. 
And the k2eper of the prison awaking out of his sl2ep, and s2eing the prison d2ors open, he drew out his sword, and would have ki2led himself, su2posing that the prisoners had b2en fled. 
But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are a2l here. 
Then he ca2led for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fe2l down before Paul and Silas, 
And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? 
And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. 
And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to a2l that were in his house. 
And he t2ok them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and a2l his, straightway. 
And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with a2l his house. 
And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go. 
And the k2eper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace. 
But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out. 
And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans. 
And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city. 
And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had s2en the brethren, they comforted them, and departed. 
Now when they had pa2sed through Amphipolis and Apo2lonia, they came to The2salonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews: 
And Paul, as his ma2ner was, went in unto them, and thr2e sa2bath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures, 
Opening and a2leging, that Christ must n2eds have su2fered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ. 
And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Gr2eks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few. 
But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, t2ok unto them certain lewd fe2lows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set a2l the city on an uproar, and a2saulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people. 
And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also; 
Whom Jason hath received: and these a2l do contrary to the decr2es of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus. 
And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things. 
And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go. 
And the brethren i2mediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews. 
These were more noble than those in The2salonica, in that they received the word with a2l readine2s of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so. 
Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Gr2eks, and of men, not a few. 
But when the Jews of The2salonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and sti2red up the people. 
And then i2mediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there sti2l. 
And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a co2mandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with a2l sp2ed, they departed. 
Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was sti2red in him, when he saw the city who2ly given to idolatry. 
Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him. 
Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What wi2l this ba2bler say? other some, He s2emeth to be a se2ter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resu2rection. 
And they t2ok him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is? 
For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean. 
(For a2l the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to te2l, or to hear some new thing.) 
Then Paul st2od in the midst of Mars' hi2l, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in a2l things ye are t2o superstitious. 
For as I pa2sed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. 
God that made the world and a2l things therein, s2eing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwe2leth not in temples made with hands; 
Neither is worshi2ped with men's hands, as though he n2eded any thing, s2eing he giveth to a2l life, and breath, and a2l things; 
And hath made of one bl2od a2l nations of men for to dwe2l on a2l the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before a2pointed, and the bounds of their habitation; 
That they should s2ek the Lord, if haply they might f2el after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us: 
For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his o2fspring. 
Forasmuch then as we are the o2fspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device. 
And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now co2mandeth a2l men every where to repent: 
Because he hath a2pointed a day, in the which he wi2l judge the world in righteousne2s by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given a2surance unto a2l men, in that he hath raised him from the dead. 
And when they heard of the resu2rection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We wi2l hear th2e again of this ma2ter. 
So Paul departed from among them. 
Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them. 
After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; 
And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Prisci2la; (because that Claudius had co2manded a2l Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them. 
And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their o2cupation they were tentmakers. 
And he reasoned in the synagogue every sa2bath, and persuaded the Jews and the Gr2eks. 
And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pre2sed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ. 
And when they o2posed themselves, and blasphemed, he sh2ok his raiment, and said unto them, Your bl2od be upon your own heads; I am clean; from henceforth I wi2l go unto the Gentiles. 
And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshi2ped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. 
And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with a2l his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized. 
Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: 
For I am with th2e, and no man sha2l set on th2e to hurt th2e: for I have much people in this city. 
And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. 
And when Ga2lio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insu2rection with one a2cord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat, 
Saying, This fe2low persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law. 
And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Ga2lio said unto the Jews, If it were a ma2ter of wrong or wicked lewdne2s, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: 
But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, l2ok ye to it; for I wi2l be no judge of such ma2ters. 
And he drave them from the judgment seat. 
Then a2l the Gr2eks t2ok Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Ga2lio cared for none of those things. 
And Paul after this ta2ried there yet a g2od while, and then t2ok his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Prisci2la and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow. 
And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. 
When they desired him to ta2ry longer time with them, he consented not; 
But bade them farewe2l, saying, I must by a2l means k2ep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I wi2l return again unto you, if God wi2l. And he sailed from Ephesus. 
And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch. 
And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over a2l the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening a2l the disciples. 
And a certain Jew named Apo2los, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. 
This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. 
And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Prisci2la had heard, they t2ok him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly. 
And when he was disposed to pa2s into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace: 
For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ. 
And it came to pa2s, that, while Apo2los was at Corinth, Paul having pa2sed through the u2per coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples, 
He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. 
And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism. 
Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. 
When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied. 
And a2l the men were about twelve. 
And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of thr2e months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God. 
But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the sch2ol of one Tyra2nus. 
And this continued by the space of two years; so that a2l they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Gr2eks. 
And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: 
So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them. 
Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, t2ok upon them to ca2l over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. 
And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so. 
And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? 
And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. 
And this was known to a2l the Jews and Gr2eks also dwe2ling at Ephesus; and fear fe2l on them a2l, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. 
And many that believed came, and confe2sed, and shewed their d2eds. 
Many of them also which used curious arts brought their b2oks together, and burned them before a2l men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. 
So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed. 
After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had pa2sed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have b2en there, I must also s2e Rome. 
So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season. 
And the same time there arose no sma2l stir about that way. 
For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no sma2l gain unto the craftsmen; 
Whom he ca2led together with the workmen of like o2cupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth. 
Moreover ye s2e and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout a2l Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands: 
So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great go2de2s Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom a2l Asia and the world worshi2peth. 
And when they heard these sayings, they were fu2l of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. 
And the whole city was fi2led with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one a2cord into the theatre. 
And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples su2fered him not. 
And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre. 
Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the a2sembly was confused: and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together. 
And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews pu2ting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people. 
But when they knew that he was a Jew, a2l with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. 
And when the townclerk had a2peased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshi2per of the great go2de2s Diana, and of the image which fe2l down from Jupiter? 
S2eing then that these things ca2not be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly. 
For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither ro2bers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your go2de2s. 
Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a ma2ter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another. 
But if ye enquire any thing concerning other ma2ters, it sha2l be determined in a lawful a2sembly. 
For we are in danger to be ca2led in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an a2count of this concourse. 
And when he had thus spoken, he dismi2sed the a2sembly. 
And after the uproar was ceased, Paul ca2led unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia. 
And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Gr2ece, 
And there abode thr2e months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia. 
And there a2companied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the The2salonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. 
These going before ta2ried for us at Troas. 
And we sailed away from Phili2pi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days. 
And upon the first day of the w2ek, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the mo2row; and continued his sp2ech until midnight. 
And there were many lights in the u2per chamber, where they were gathered together. 
And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fa2len into a d2ep sl2ep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sl2ep, and fe2l down from the third loft, and was taken up dead. 
And Paul went down, and fe2l on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him. 
When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even ti2l break of day, so he departed. 
And they brought the young man alive, and were not a li2tle comforted. 
And we went before to ship, and sailed unto A2sos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he a2pointed, minding himself to go af2ot. 
And when he met with us at A2sos, we t2ok him in, and came to Mitylene. 
And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we a2rived at Samos, and ta2ried at Trogy2lium; and the next day we came to Miletus. 
For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were po2sible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost. 
And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and ca2led the elders of the church. 
And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what ma2ner I have b2en with you at a2l seasons, 
Serving the LORD with a2l humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befe2l me by the lying in wait of the Jews: 
And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house, 
Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Gr2eks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. 
And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that sha2l befa2l me there: 
Save that the Holy Ghost witne2seth in every city, saying that bonds and a2flictions abide me. 
But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. 
And now, behold, I know that ye a2l, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, sha2l s2e my face no more. 
Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the bl2od of a2l men. 
For I have not shu2ned to declare unto you a2l the counsel of God. 
Take h2ed therefore unto yourselves, and to a2l the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overs2ers, to f2ed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own bl2od. 
For I know this, that after my departing sha2l grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. 
Also of your own selves sha2l men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. 
Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of thr2e years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. 
And now, brethren, I co2mend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among a2l them which are sanctified. 
I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or a2parel. 
Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my nece2sities, and to them that were with me. 
I have shewed you a2l things, how that so labouring ye ought to su2port the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more ble2sed to give than to receive. 
And when he had thus spoken, he kn2eled down, and prayed with them a2l. 
And they a2l wept sore, and fe2l on Paul's neck, and ki2sed him, 
So2rowing most of a2l for the words which he spake, that they should s2e his face no more. And they a2companied him unto the ship. 
And it came to pa2s, that after we were go2ten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto C2os, and the day fo2lowing unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara: 
And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth. 
Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden. 
And finding disciples, we ta2ried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem. 
And when we had a2complished those days, we departed and went our way; and they a2l brought us on our way, with wives and children, ti2l we were out of the city: and we kn2eled down on the shore, and prayed. 
And when we had taken our leave one of another, we t2ok ship; and they returned home again. 
And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day. 
And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him. 
And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy. 
And as we ta2ried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus. 
And when he was come unto us, he t2ok Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and f2et, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So sha2l the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and sha2l deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. 
And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem. 
Then Paul answered, What mean ye to w2ep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. 
And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The wi2l of the Lord be done. 
And after those days we t2ok up our ca2riages, and went up to Jerusalem. 
There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge. 
And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly. 
And the day fo2lowing Paul went in with us unto James; and a2l the elders were present. 
And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry. 
And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou s2est, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are a2l zealous of the law: 
And they are informed of th2e, that thou teachest a2l the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs. 
What is it therefore? the multitude must n2eds come together: for they wi2l hear that thou art come. 
Do therefore this that we say to th2e: We have four men which have a vow on them; 
Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and a2l may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning th2e, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and k2epest the law. 
As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have wri2ten and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they k2ep themselves from things o2fered to idols, and from bl2od, and from strangled, and from fornication. 
Then Paul t2ok the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the a2complishment of the days of purification, until that an o2fering should be o2fered for every one of them. 
And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, sti2red up a2l the people, and laid hands on him, 
Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth a2l men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Gr2eks also into the temple, and hath po2luted this holy place. 
(For they had s2en before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they su2posed that Paul had brought into the temple.) 
And a2l the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they t2ok Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the d2ors were shut. 
And as they went about to ki2l him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that a2l Jerusalem was in an uproar. 
Who i2mediately t2ok soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul. 
Then the chief captain came near, and t2ok him, and co2manded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done. 
And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he co2manded him to be ca2ried into the castle. 
And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people. 
For the multitude of the people fo2lowed after, crying, Away with him. 
And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto th2e? Who said, Canst thou speak Gr2ek? 
Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and le2dest out into the wilderne2s four thousand men that were murderers? 
But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I bes2ech th2e, su2fer me to speak unto the people. 
And when he had given him licence, Paul st2od on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying, 
Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto you. 
(And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,) 
I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the f2et of Gamaliel, and taught a2cording to the perfect ma2ner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye a2l are this day. 
And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women. 
As also the high priest doth bear me witne2s, and a2l the estate of the elders: from whom also I received le2ters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished. 
And it came to pa2s, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about n2on, su2denly there shone from heaven a great light round about me. 
And I fe2l unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 
And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest. 
And they that were with me saw ind2ed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me. 
And I said, What sha2l I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it sha2l be told th2e of a2l things which are a2pointed for th2e to do. 
And when I could not s2e for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus. 
And one Ananias, a devout man a2cording to the law, having a g2od report of a2l the Jews which dwelt there, 
Came unto me, and st2od, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I l2oked up upon him. 
And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen th2e, that thou shouldest know his wi2l, and s2e that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth. 
For thou shalt be his witne2s unto a2l men of what thou hast s2en and heard. 
And now why ta2riest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, ca2ling on the name of the Lord. 
And it came to pa2s, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance; 
And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get th2e quickly out of Jerusalem: for they wi2l not receive thy testimony concerning me. 
And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on th2e: 
And when the bl2od of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him. 
And he said unto me, Depart: for I wi2l send th2e far hence unto the Gentiles. 
And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fe2low from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live. 
And as they cried out, and cast o2f their clothes, and threw dust into the air, 
The chief captain co2manded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him. 
And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that st2od by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned? 
When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take h2ed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman. 
Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Te2l me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea. 
And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this fr2edom. And Paul said, But I was fr2e born. 
Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him. 
On the mo2row, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was a2cused of the Jews, he l2osed him from his bands, and co2manded the chief priests and a2l their council to a2pear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them. 
And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in a2l g2od conscience before God until this day. 
And the high priest Ananias co2manded them that st2od by him to smite him on the mouth. 
Then said Paul unto him, God sha2l smite th2e, thou whited wa2l: for si2test thou to judge me after the law, and co2mandest me to be smi2ten contrary to the law? 
And they that st2od by said, Revilest thou God's high priest? 
Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is wri2ten, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people. 
But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sa2duc2es, and the other Pharis2es, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharis2e, the son of a Pharis2e: of the hope and resu2rection of the dead I am ca2led in question. 
And when he had so said, there arose a di2sension betw2en the Pharis2es and the Sa2duc2es: and the multitude was divided. 
For the Sa2duc2es say that there is no resu2rection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharis2es confe2s both. 
And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharis2es' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God. 
And when there arose a great di2sension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have b2en pu2led in pieces of them, co2manded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle. 
And the night fo2lowing the Lord st2od by him, and said, Be of g2od ch2er, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witne2s also at Rome. 
And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink ti2l they had ki2led Paul. 
And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy. 
And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we wi2l eat nothing until we have slain Paul. 
Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to mo2row, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to ki2l him. 
And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul. 
Then Paul ca2led one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to te2l him. 
So he t2ok him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner ca2led me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto th2e, who hath something to say unto th2e. 
Then the chief captain t2ok him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to te2l me? 
And he said, The Jews have agr2ed to desire th2e that thou wouldest bring down Paul to mo2row into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly. 
But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they wi2l neither eat nor drink ti2l they have ki2led him: and now are they ready, l2oking for a promise from th2e. 
So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, S2e thou te2l no man that thou hast shewed these things to me. 
And he ca2led unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen thr2escore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night; 
And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor. 
And he wrote a le2ter after this ma2ner: 
Claudius Lysias unto the most exce2lent governor Felix sendeth gr2eting. 
This man was taken of the Jews, and should have b2en ki2led of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having underst2od that he was a Roman. 
And when I would have known the cause wherefore they a2cused him, I brought him forth into their council: 
Whom I perceived to be a2cused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds. 
And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to th2e, and gave co2mandment to his a2cusers also to say before th2e what they had against him. Farewe2l. 
Then the soldiers, as it was co2manded them, t2ok Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris. 
On the mo2row they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle: 
Who, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him. 
And when the governor had read the le2ter, he asked of what province he was. And when he underst2od that he was of Cilicia; 
I wi2l hear th2e, said he, when thine a2cusers are also come. And he co2manded him to be kept in Herod's judgment ha2l. 
And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertu2lus, who informed the governor against Paul. 
And when he was ca2led forth, Tertu2lus began to a2cuse him, saying, S2eing that by th2e we enjoy great quietne2s, and that very worthy d2eds are done unto this nation by thy providence, 
We a2cept it always, and in a2l places, most noble Felix, with a2l thankfulne2s. 
Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto th2e, I pray th2e that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words. 
For we have found this man a pestilent fe2low, and a mover of sedition among a2l the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: 
Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we t2ok, and would have judged a2cording to our law. 
But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence t2ok him away out of our hands, 
Co2manding his a2cusers to come unto th2e: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of a2l these things, whereof we a2cuse him. 
And the Jews also a2sented, saying that these things were so. 
Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast b2en of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more ch2erfu2ly answer for myself: 
Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship. 
And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city: 
Neither can they prove the things whereof they now a2cuse me. 
But this I confe2s unto th2e, that after the way which they ca2l heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing a2l things which are wri2ten in the law and in the prophets: 
And have hope toward God, which they themselves also a2low, that there sha2l be a resu2rection of the dead, both of the just and unjust. 
And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to o2fence toward God, and toward men. 
Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and o2ferings. 
Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult. 
Who ought to have b2en here before th2e, and object, if they had ought against me. 
Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I st2od before the council, 
Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resu2rection of the dead I am ca2led in question by you this day. 
And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he defe2red them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain sha2l come down, I wi2l know the u2termost of your ma2ter. 
And he co2manded a centurion to k2ep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him. 
And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusi2la, which was a Jewe2s, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. 
And as he reasoned of righteousne2s, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I wi2l ca2l for th2e. 
He hoped also that money should have b2en given him of Paul, that he might l2ose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and co2muned with him. 
But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' r2om: and Felix, wi2ling to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound. 
Now when Festus was come into the province, after thr2e days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem. 
Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him, 
And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to ki2l him. 
But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither. 
Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and a2cuse this man, if there be any wickedne2s in him. 
And when he had ta2ried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day si2ting on the judgment seat co2manded Paul to be brought. 
And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem st2od round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove. 
While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I o2fended any thing at a2l. 
But Festus, wi2ling to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me? 
Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very we2l knowest. 
For if I be an o2fender, or have co2mi2ted any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these a2cuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I a2peal unto Caesar. 
Then Festus, when he had confe2red with the council, answered, Hast thou a2pealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go. 
And after certain days king Agri2pa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus. 
And when they had b2en there many days, Festus declared Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix: 
About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him. 
To whom I answered, It is not the ma2ner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is a2cused have the a2cusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him. 
Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the mo2row I sat on the judgment seat, and co2manded the man to be brought forth. 
Against whom when the a2cusers st2od up, they brought none a2cusation of such things as I su2posed: 
But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul a2firmed to be alive. 
And because I doubted of such ma2ner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these ma2ters. 
But when Paul had a2pealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I co2manded him to be kept ti2l I might send him to Caesar. 
Then Agri2pa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To mo2row, said he, thou shalt hear him. 
And on the mo2row, when Agri2pa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' co2mandment Paul was brought forth. 
And Festus said, King Agri2pa, and a2l men which are here present with us, ye s2e this man, about whom a2l the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer. 
But when I found that he had co2mi2ted nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath a2pealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him. 
Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specia2ly before th2e, O king Agri2pa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write. 
For it s2emeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him. 
Then Agri2pa said unto Paul, Thou art permi2ted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself: 
I think myself ha2py, king Agri2pa, because I sha2l answer for myself this day before th2e touching a2l the things whereof I am a2cused of the Jews: 
Especia2ly because I know th2e to be expert in a2l customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I bes2ech th2e to hear me patiently. 
My ma2ner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know a2l the Jews; 
Which knew me from the begi2ning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharis2e. 
And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God, unto our fathers: 
Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agri2pa, I am a2cused of the Jews. 
Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead? 
I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. 
Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them. 
And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compe2led them to blaspheme; and being exc2edingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities. 
Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and co2mi2sion from the chief priests, 
At mi2day, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightne2s of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me. 
And when we were a2l fa2len to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for th2e to kick against the pricks. 
And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. 
But rise, and stand upon thy f2et: for I have a2peared unto th2e for this purpose, to make th2e a minister and a witne2s both of these things which thou hast s2en, and of those things in the which I wi2l a2pear unto th2e; 
Delivering th2e from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send th2e, 
To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkne2s to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgivene2s of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me. 
Whereupon, O king Agri2pa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision: 
But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout a2l the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works m2et for repentance. 
For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to ki2l me. 
Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witne2sing both to sma2l and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come: 
That Christ should su2fer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles. 
And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make th2e mad. 
But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberne2s. 
For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak fr2ely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hi2den from him; for this thing was not done in a corner. 
King Agri2pa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest. 
Then Agri2pa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian. 
And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also a2l that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds. 
And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them: 
And when they were gone aside, they talked betw2en themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds. 
Then said Agri2pa unto Festus, This man might have b2en set at liberty, if he had not a2pealed unto Caesar. 
And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus' band. 
And entering into a ship of Adramy2tium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of The2salonica, being with us. 
And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself. 
And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. 
And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia. 
And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein. 
And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not su2fering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone; 
And, hardly pa2sing it, came unto a place which is ca2led The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea. 
Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them, 
And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage wi2l be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives. 
Neverthele2s the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul. 
And because the haven was not co2modious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might a2tain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west. 
And when the south wind blew softly, su2posing that they had obtained their purpose, l2osing thence, they sailed close by Crete. 
But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, ca2led Euroclydon. 
And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive. 
And ru2ning under a certain island which is ca2led Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat: 
Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fa2l into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven. 
And we being exc2edingly to2sed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship; 
And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship. 
And when neither sun nor stars in many days a2peared, and no sma2l tempest lay on us, a2l hope that we should be saved was then taken away. 
But after long abstinence Paul st2od forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have l2osed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and lo2s. 
And now I exhort you to be of g2od ch2er: for there sha2l be no lo2s of any man's life among you, but of the ship. 
For there st2od by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, 
Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given th2e a2l them that sail with th2e. 
Wherefore, sirs, be of g2od ch2er: for I believe God, that it sha2l be even as it was told me. 
Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island. 
But when the fourt2enth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen d2emed that they drew near to some country; 
And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a li2tle further, they sounded again, and found it fift2en fathoms. 
Then fearing lest we should have fa2len upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day. 
And as the shipmen were about to fl2e out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship, 
Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye ca2not be saved. 
Then the soldiers cut o2f the ropes of the boat, and let her fa2l o2f. 
And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them a2l to take meat, saying, This day is the fourt2enth day that ye have ta2ried and continued fasting, having taken nothing. 
Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there sha2l not an hair fa2l from the head of any of you. 
And when he had thus spoken, he t2ok bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them a2l: and when he had broken it, he began to eat. 
Then were they a2l of g2od ch2er, and they also t2ok some meat. 
And we were in a2l in the ship two hundred thr2escore and sixt2en souls. 
And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea. 
And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain cr2ek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were po2sible, to thrust in the ship. 
And when they had taken up the anchors, they co2mi2ted themselves unto the sea, and l2osed the ru2der bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore. 
And fa2ling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves. 
And the soldiers' counsel was to ki2l the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape. 
But the centurion, wi2ling to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and co2manded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land: 
And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pa2s, that they escaped a2l safe to land. 
And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was ca2led Melita. 
And the barbarous people shewed us no li2tle kindne2s: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold. 
And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand. 
And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance su2fereth not to live. 
And he sh2ok o2f the beast into the fire, and felt no harm. 
Howbeit they l2oked when he should have swo2len, or fa2len down dead su2denly: but after they had l2oked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god. 
In the same quarters were po2se2sions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us thr2e days courteously. 
And it came to pa2s, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bl2ody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him. 
So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed: 
Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were nece2sary. 
And after thr2e months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Po2lux. 
And landing at Syracuse, we ta2ried there thr2e days. 
And from thence we fetched a compa2s, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli: 
Where we found brethren, and were desired to ta2ry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome. 
And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to m2et us as far as A2p2i forum, and The thr2e taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and t2ok courage. 
And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was su2fered to dwe2l by himself with a soldier that kept him. 
And it came to pa2s, that after thr2e days Paul ca2led the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have co2mi2ted nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. 
Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me. 
But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to a2peal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to a2cuse my nation of. 
For this cause therefore have I ca2led for you, to s2e you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain. 
And they said unto him, We neither received le2ters out of Judaea concerning th2e, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of th2e. 
But we desire to hear of th2e what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against. 
And when they had a2pointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning ti2l evening. 
And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not. 
And when they agr2ed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, We2l spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers, 
Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye sha2l hear, and sha2l not understand; and s2eing ye sha2l s2e, and not perceive: 
For the heart of this people is waxed gro2s, and their ears are du2l of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should s2e with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. 
Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they wi2l hear it. 
And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves. 
And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received a2l that came in unto him, 
Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with a2l confidence, no man forbi2ding him. 
Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, ca2led to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, 
(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,) 
Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the s2ed of David a2cording to the flesh; 
And declared to be the Son of God with power, a2cording to the spirit of holine2s, by the resu2rection from the dead: 
By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among a2l nations, for his name: 
Among whom are ye also the ca2led of Jesus Christ: 
To a2l that be in Rome, beloved of God, ca2led to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you a2l, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. 
For God is my witne2s, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers; 
Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the wi2l of God to come unto you. 
For I long to s2e you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established; 
That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me. 
Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles. 
I am debtor both to the Gr2eks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise. 
So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also. 
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Gr2ek. 
For therein is the righteousne2s of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is wri2ten, The just sha2l live by faith. 
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against a2l ungodline2s and unrighteousne2s of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousne2s; 
Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. 
For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly s2en, being underst2od by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: 
Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their f2olish heart was darkened. 
Profe2sing themselves to be wise, they became f2ols, 
And changed the glory of the unco2ruptible God into an image made like to co2ruptible man, and to birds, and fourf2oted beasts, and cr2eping things. 
Wherefore God also gave them up to unclea2ne2s through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies betw2en themselves: 
Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshi2ped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is ble2sed for ever. Amen. 
For this cause God gave them up unto vile a2fections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: 
And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is uns2emly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their e2ror which was m2et. 
And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; 
Being fi2led with a2l unrighteousne2s, fornication, wickedne2s, covetousne2s, maliciousne2s; fu2l of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, 
Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 
Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural a2fection, implacable, unmerciful: 
Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which co2mit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. 
Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things. 
But we are sure that the judgment of God is a2cording to truth against them which co2mit such things. 
And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? 
Or despisest thou the riches of his g2odne2s and forbearance and longsu2fering; not knowing that the g2odne2s of God leadeth th2e to repentance? 
But after thy hardne2s and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; 
Who wi2l render to every man a2cording to his d2eds: 
To them who by patient continuance in we2l doing s2ek for glory and honour and i2mortality, eternal life: 
But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousne2s, indignation and wrath, 
Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; 
But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh g2od, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: 
For there is no respect of persons with God. 
For as many as have si2ned without law sha2l also perish without law: and as many as have si2ned in the law sha2l be judged by the law; 
(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law sha2l be justified. 
For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: 
Which shew the work of the law wri2ten in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witne2s, and their thoughts the mean while a2cusing or else excusing one another;) 
In the day when God sha2l judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ a2cording to my gospel. 
Behold, thou art ca2led a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God, 
And knowest his wi2l, and a2provest the things that are more exce2lent, being instructed out of the law; 
And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkne2s, 
An instructor of the f2olish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law. 
Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? 
Thou that sayest a man should not co2mit adultery, dost thou co2mit adultery? thou that abho2rest idols, dost thou co2mit sacrilege? 
Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God? 
For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is wri2ten. 
For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou k2ep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision. 
Therefore if the uncircumcision k2ep the righteousne2s of the law, sha2l not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? 
And sha2l not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge th2e, who by the le2ter and circumcision dost transgre2s the law? 
For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: 
But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the le2ter; whose praise is not of men, but of God. 
What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision? 
Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were co2mi2ted the oracles of God. 
For what if some did not believe? sha2l their unbelief make the faith of God without e2fect? 
God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is wri2ten, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged. 
But if our unrighteousne2s co2mend the righteousne2s of God, what sha2l we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man) 
God forbid: for then how sha2l God judge the world? 
For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a si2ner? 
And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some a2firm that we say,) Let us do evil, that g2od may come? whose damnation is just. 
What then? are we be2ter than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are a2l under sin; 
As it is wri2ten, There is none righteous, no, not one: 
There is none that understandeth, there is none that s2eketh after God. 
They are a2l gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth g2od, no, not one. 
Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: 
Whose mouth is fu2l of cursing and bi2terne2s: 
Their f2et are swift to shed bl2od: 
Destruction and misery are in their ways: 
And the way of peace have they not known: 
There is no fear of God before their eyes. 
Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be sto2ped, and a2l the world may become guilty before God. 
Therefore by the d2eds of the law there sha2l no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. 
But now the righteousne2s of God without the law is manifested, being witne2sed by the law and the prophets; 
Even the righteousne2s of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto a2l and upon a2l them that believe: for there is no di2ference: 
For a2l have si2ned, and come short of the glory of God; 
Being justified fr2ely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: 
Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his bl2od, to declare his righteousne2s for the remi2sion of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; 
To declare, I say, at this time his righteousne2s: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. 
Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. 
Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the d2eds of the law. 
Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: 
S2eing it is one God, which sha2l justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. 
Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law. 
What sha2l we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found? 
For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God. 
For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousne2s. 
Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. 
But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousne2s. 
Even as David also describeth the ble2sedne2s of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousne2s without works, 
Saying, Ble2sed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. 
Ble2sed is the man to whom the Lord wi2l not impute sin. 
Cometh this ble2sedne2s then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousne2s. 
How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. 
And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousne2s of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of a2l them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousne2s might be imputed unto them also: 
And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised. 
For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his s2ed, through the law, but through the righteousne2s of faith. 
For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none e2fect: 
Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgre2sion. 
Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to a2l the s2ed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us a2l, 
(As it is wri2ten, I have made th2e a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and ca2leth those things which be not as though they were. 
Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, a2cording to that which was spoken, So sha2l thy s2ed be. 
And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadne2s of Sarah's womb: 
He sta2gered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; 
And being fu2ly persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform. 
And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousne2s. 
Now it was not wri2ten for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; 
But for us also, to whom it sha2l be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; 
Who was delivered for our o2fences, and was raised again for our justification. 
Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: 
By whom also we have a2ce2s by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 
And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; 
And patience, experience; and experience, hope: 
And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. 
For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. 
For scarcely for a righteous man wi2l one die: yet peradventure for a g2od man some would even dare to die. 
But God co2mendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet si2ners, Christ died for us. 
Much more then, being now justified by his bl2od, we sha2l be saved from wrath through him. 
For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we sha2l be saved by his life. 
And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. 
Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death pa2sed upon a2l men, for that a2l have si2ned: 
(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. 
Neverthele2s death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not si2ned after the similitude of Adam's transgre2sion, who is the figure of him that was to come. 
But not as the o2fence, so also is the fr2e gift. For if through the o2fence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. 
And not as it was by one that si2ned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the fr2e gift is of many o2fences unto justification. 
For if by one man's o2fence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousne2s sha2l reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) 
Therefore as by the o2fence of one judgment came upon a2l men to condemnation; even so by the righteousne2s of one the fr2e gift came upon a2l men unto justification of life. 
For as by one man's disobedience many were made si2ners, so by the obedience of one sha2l many be made righteous. 
Moreover the law entered, that the o2fence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: 
That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousne2s unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord. 
What sha2l we say then? Sha2l we continue in sin, that grace may abound? 
God forbid. How sha2l we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? 
Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? 
Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newne2s of life. 
For if we have b2en planted together in the likene2s of his death, we sha2l be also in the likene2s of his resu2rection: 
Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. 
For he that is dead is fr2ed from sin. 
Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we sha2l also live with him: 
Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. 
For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. 
Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead ind2ed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. 
Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. 
Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousne2s unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousne2s unto God. 
For sin sha2l not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. 
What then? sha2l we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. 
Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousne2s? 
But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. 
Being then made fr2e from sin, ye became the servants of righteousne2s. 
I speak after the ma2ner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to unclea2ne2s and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousne2s unto holine2s. 
For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were fr2e from righteousne2s. 
What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death. 
But now being made fr2e from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holine2s, and the end everlasting life. 
For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. 
Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth? 
For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is l2osed from the law of her husband. 
So then if, while her husband liveth, she be ma2ried to another man, she sha2l be ca2led an adultere2s: but if her husband be dead, she is fr2e from that law; so that she is no adultere2s, though she be ma2ried to another man. 
Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be ma2ried to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. 
For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. 
But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newne2s of spirit, and not in the oldne2s of the le2ter. 
What sha2l we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. 
But sin, taking o2casion by the co2mandment, wrought in me a2l ma2ner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. 
For I was alive without the law once: but when the co2mandment came, sin revived, and I died. 
And the co2mandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. 
For sin, taking o2casion by the co2mandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. 
Wherefore the law is holy, and the co2mandment holy, and just, and g2od. 
Was then that which is g2od made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might a2pear sin, working death in me by that which is g2od; that sin by the co2mandment might become exc2eding sinful. 
For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin. 
For that which I do I a2low not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. 
If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is g2od. 
Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwe2leth in me. 
For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwe2leth no g2od thing: for to wi2l is present with me; but how to perform that which is g2od I find not. 
For the g2od that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. 
Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwe2leth in me. 
I find then a law, that, when I would do g2od, evil is present with me. 
For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: 
But I s2e another law in my members, wa2ring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. 
O wretched man that I am! who sha2l deliver me from the body of this death? 
I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin. 
There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me fr2e from the law of sin and death. 
For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likene2s of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: 
That the righteousne2s of the law might be fulfi2led in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 
For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. 
For to be carna2ly minded is death; but to be spiritua2ly minded is life and peace. 
Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither ind2ed can be. 
So then they that are in the flesh ca2not please God. 
But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwe2l in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. 
And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousne2s. 
But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwe2l in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead sha2l also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwe2leth in you. 
Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. 
For if ye live after the flesh, ye sha2l die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the d2eds of the body, ye sha2l live. 
For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. 
For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, A2ba, Father. 
The Spirit itself beareth witne2s with our spirit, that we are the children of God: 
And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we su2fer with him, that we may be also glorified together. 
For I reckon that the su2ferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which sha2l be revealed in us. 
For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. 
For the creature was made subject to vanity, not wi2lingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope, 
Because the creature itself also sha2l be delivered from the bondage of co2ruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. 
For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. 
And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. 
For we are saved by hope: but hope that is s2en is not hope: for what a man s2eth, why doth he yet hope for? 
But if we hope for that we s2e not, then do we with patience wait for it. 
Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh interce2sion for us with groanings which ca2not be u2tered. 
And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh interce2sion for the saints a2cording to the wi2l of God. 
And we know that a2l things work together for g2od to them that love God, to them who are the ca2led a2cording to his purpose. 
For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. 
Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also ca2led: and whom he ca2led, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified. 
What sha2l we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? 
He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us a2l, how sha2l he not with him also fr2ely give us a2l things? 
Who sha2l lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. 
Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh interce2sion for us. 
Who sha2l separate us from the love of Christ? sha2l tribulation, or distre2s, or persecution, or famine, or nakedne2s, or peril, or sword? 
As it is wri2ten, For thy sake we are ki2led a2l the day long; we are a2counted as sh2ep for the slaughter. 
Nay, in a2l these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. 
For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, 
Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, sha2l be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witne2s in the Holy Ghost, 
That I have great heavine2s and continual so2row in my heart. 
For I could wish that myself were a2cursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen a2cording to the flesh: 
Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises; 
Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over a2l, God ble2sed for ever. Amen. 
Not as though the word of God hath taken none e2fect. For they are not a2l Israel, which are of Israel: 
Neither, because they are the s2ed of Abraham, are they a2l children: but, In Is2ac sha2l thy s2ed be ca2led. 
That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the s2ed. 
For this is the word of promise, At this time wi2l I come, and Sarah sha2l have a son. 
And not only this; but when Rebe2ca also had conceived by one, even by our father Is2ac; 
(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any g2od or evil, that the purpose of God a2cording to election might stand, not of works, but of him that ca2leth;) 
It was said unto her, The elder sha2l serve the younger. 
As it is wri2ten, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. 
What sha2l we say then? Is there unrighteousne2s with God? God forbid. 
For he saith to Moses, I wi2l have mercy on whom I wi2l have mercy, and I wi2l have compa2sion on whom I wi2l have compa2sion. 
So then it is not of him that wi2leth, nor of him that ru2neth, but of God that sheweth mercy. 
For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised th2e up, that I might shew my power in th2e, and that my name might be declared throughout a2l the earth. 
Therefore hath he mercy on whom he wi2l have mercy, and whom he wi2l he hardeneth. 
Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his wi2l? 
Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Sha2l the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? 
Hath not the po2ter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one ve2sel unto honour, and another unto dishonour? 
What if God, wi2ling to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsu2fering the ve2sels of wrath fi2ted to destruction: 
And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the ve2sels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, 
Even us, whom he hath ca2led, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles? 
As he saith also in Os2e, I wi2l ca2l them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. 
And it sha2l come to pa2s, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there sha2l they be ca2led the children of the living God. 
Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant sha2l be saved: 
For he wi2l finish the work, and cut it short in righteousne2s: because a short work wi2l the Lord make upon the earth. 
And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a s2ed, we had b2en as Sodoma, and b2en made like unto Gomo2rha. 
What sha2l we say then? That the Gentiles, which fo2lowed not after righteousne2s, have a2tained to righteousne2s, even the righteousne2s which is of faith. 
But Israel, which fo2lowed after the law of righteousne2s, hath not a2tained to the law of righteousne2s. 
Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone; 
As it is wri2ten, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of o2fence: and whosoever believeth on him sha2l not be ashamed. 
Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved. 
For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not a2cording to knowledge. 
For they being ignorant of God's righteousne2s, and going about to establish their own righteousne2s, have not submi2ted themselves unto the righteousne2s of God. 
For Christ is the end of the law for righteousne2s to every one that believeth. 
For Moses describeth the righteousne2s which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things sha2l live by them. 
But the righteousne2s which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who sha2l ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:) 
Or, Who sha2l descend into the d2ep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) 
But what saith it? The word is nigh th2e, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; 
That if thou shalt confe2s with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 
For with the heart man believeth unto righteousne2s; and with the mouth confe2sion is made unto salvation. 
For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him sha2l not be ashamed. 
For there is no di2ference betw2en the Jew and the Gr2ek: for the same Lord over a2l is rich unto a2l that ca2l upon him. 
For whosoever sha2l ca2l upon the name of the Lord sha2l be saved. 
How then sha2l they ca2l on him in whom they have not believed? and how sha2l they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how sha2l they hear without a preacher? 
And how sha2l they preach, except they be sent? as it is wri2ten, How beautiful are the f2et of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of g2od things! 
But they have not a2l obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? 
So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. 
But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into a2l the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world. 
But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I wi2l provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a f2olish nation I wi2l anger you. 
But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me. 
But to Israel he saith, A2l day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people. 
I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the s2ed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. 
God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh interce2sion to God against Israel saying, 
Lord, they have ki2led thy prophets, and di2ged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they s2ek my life. 
But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the kn2e to the image of B2al. 
Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant a2cording to the election of grace. 
And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work. 
What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he s2eketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded. 
(A2cording as it is wri2ten, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not s2e, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day. 
And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them: 
Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not s2e, and bow down their back alway. 
I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fa2l? God forbid: but rather through their fa2l salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy. 
Now if the fa2l of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulne2s? 
For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine o2fice: 
If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them. 
For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what sha2l the receiving of them be, but life from the dead? 
For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the r2ot be holy, so are the branches. 
And if some of the branches be broken o2f, and thou, being a wild olive tr2e, wert gra2fed in among them, and with them partakest of the r2ot and fatne2s of the olive tr2e; 
Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the r2ot, but the r2ot th2e. 
Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken o2f, that I might be gra2fed in. 
We2l; because of unbelief they were broken o2f, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear: 
For if God spared not the natural branches, take h2ed lest he also spare not th2e. 
Behold therefore the g2odne2s and severity of God: on them which fe2l, severity; but toward th2e, g2odne2s, if thou continue in his g2odne2s: otherwise thou also shalt be cut o2f. 
And they also, if they abide not sti2l in unbelief, sha2l be gra2fed in: for God is able to gra2f them in again. 
For if thou wert cut out of the olive tr2e which is wild by nature, and wert gra2fed contrary to nature into a g2od olive tr2e: how much more sha2l these, which be the natural branches, be gra2fed into their own olive tr2e? 
For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindne2s in part is ha2pened to Israel, until the fulne2s of the Gentiles be come in. 
And so a2l Israel sha2l be saved: as it is wri2ten, There sha2l come out of Sion the Deliverer, and sha2l turn away ungodline2s from Jacob: 
For this is my covenant unto them, when I sha2l take away their sins. 
As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes. 
For the gifts and ca2ling of God are without repentance. 
For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief: 
Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy. 
For God hath concluded them a2l in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon a2l. 
O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! 
For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath b2en his counse2lor? 
Or who hath first given to him, and it sha2l be recompensed unto him again? 
For of him, and through him, and to him, are a2l things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen. 
I bes2ech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, a2ceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. 
And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that g2od, and a2ceptable, and perfect, wi2l of God. 
For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, a2cording as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. 
For as we have many members in one body, and a2l members have not the same o2fice: 
So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another. 
Having then gifts di2fering a2cording to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy a2cording to the proportion of faith; 
Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; 
Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with ch2erfulne2s. 
Let love be without di2simulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is g2od. 
Be kindly a2fectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour prefe2ring one another; 
Not slothful in busine2s; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; 
Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; 
Distributing to the nece2sity of saints; given to hospitality. 
Ble2s them which persecute you: ble2s, and curse not. 
Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and w2ep with them that w2ep. 
Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. 
Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of a2l men. 
If it be po2sible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with a2l men. 
Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is wri2ten, Vengeance is mine; I wi2l repay, saith the Lord. 
Therefore if thine enemy hunger, f2ed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. 
Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with g2od. 
Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. 
Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist sha2l receive to themselves damnation. 
For rulers are not a te2ror to g2od works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is g2od, and thou shalt have praise of the same: 
For he is the minister of God to th2e for g2od. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil. 
Wherefore ye must n2eds be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. 
For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, a2tending continua2ly upon this very thing. 
Render therefore to a2l their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour. 
Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfi2led the law. 
For this, Thou shalt not co2mit adultery, Thou shalt not ki2l, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witne2s, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other co2mandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 
Love worketh no i2l to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfi2ling of the law. 
And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sl2ep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. 
The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast o2f the works of darkne2s, and let us put on the armour of light. 
Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunke2ne2s, not in chambering and wanto2ne2s, not in strife and envying. 
But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof. 
Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations. 
For one believeth that he may eat a2l things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. 
Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him. 
Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or fa2leth. Yea, he sha2l be holden up: for God is able to make him stand. 
One man est2emeth one day above another: another est2emeth every day alike. Let every man be fu2ly persuaded in his own mind. 
He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. 
For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself. 
For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. 
For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living. 
But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we sha2l a2l stand before the judgment seat of Christ. 
For it is wri2ten, As I live, saith the Lord, every kn2e sha2l bow to me, and every tongue sha2l confe2s to God. 
So then every one of us sha2l give a2count of himself to God. 
Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an o2casion to fa2l in his brother's way. 
I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that est2emeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean. 
But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. 
Let not then your g2od be evil spoken of: 
For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousne2s, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. 
For he that in these things serveth Christ is a2ceptable to God, and a2proved of men. 
Let us therefore fo2low after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another. 
For meat destroy not the work of God. A2l things ind2ed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with o2fence. 
It is g2od neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is o2fended, or is made weak. 
Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Ha2py is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he a2loweth. 
And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin. 
We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. 
Let every one of us please his neighbour for his g2od to edification. 
For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is wri2ten, The reproaches of them that reproached th2e fe2l on me. 
For whatsoever things were wri2ten aforetime were wri2ten for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. 
Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another a2cording to Christ Jesus: 
That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God. 
Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers: 
And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is wri2ten, For this cause I wi2l confe2s to th2e among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name. 
And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people. 
And again, Praise the Lord, a2l ye Gentiles; and laud him, a2l ye people. 
And again, Esaias saith, There sha2l be a r2ot of Je2se, and he that sha2l rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him sha2l the Gentiles trust. 
Now the God of hope fi2l you with a2l joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost. 
And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are fu2l of g2odne2s, fi2led with a2l knowledge, able also to admonish one another. 
Neverthele2s, brethren, I have wri2ten the more boldly unto you in some sort, as pu2ting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God, 
That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the o2fering up of the Gentiles might be a2ceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost. 
I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God. 
For I wi2l not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and d2ed, 
Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto I2lyricum, I have fu2ly preached the gospel of Christ. 
Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation: 
But as it is wri2ten, To whom he was not spoken of, they sha2l s2e: and they that have not heard sha2l understand. 
For which cause also I have b2en much hindered from coming to you. 
But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you; 
Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I wi2l come to you: for I trust to s2e you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat fi2led with your company. 
But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints. 
For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the p2or saints which are at Jerusalem. 
It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have b2en made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things. 
When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I wi2l come by you into Spain. 
And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I sha2l come in the fulne2s of the ble2sing of the gospel of Christ. 
Now I bes2ech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me; 
That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be a2cepted of the saints; 
That I may come unto you with joy by the wi2l of God, and may with you be refreshed. 
Now the God of peace be with you a2l. Amen. 
I co2mend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea: 
That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye a2sist her in whatsoever busine2s she hath n2ed of you: for she hath b2en a su2courer of many, and of myself also. 
Gr2et Prisci2la and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus: 
Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also a2l the churches of the Gentiles. 
Likewise gr2et the church that is in their house. Salute my we2l-beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ. 
Gr2et Mary, who bestowed much labour on us. 
Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fe2low-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me. 
Gr2et Amplias my beloved in the Lord. 
Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved. 
Salute Ape2les a2proved in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristobulus' household. 
Salute Herodion my kinsman. Gr2et them that be of the household of Narci2sus, which are in the Lord. 
Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord. 
Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine. 
Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them. 
Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and a2l the saints which are with them. 
Salute one another with an holy ki2s. The churches of Christ salute you. 
Now I bes2ech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and o2fences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them. 
For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own be2ly; and by g2od words and fair sp2eches deceive the hearts of the simple. 
For your obedience is come abroad unto a2l men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is g2od, and simple concerning evil. 
And the God of peace sha2l bruise Satan under your f2et shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. 
Timotheus my workfe2low, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you. 
I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord. 
Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you a2l. Amen. 
Now to him that is of power to stablish you a2cording to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, a2cording to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began, 
But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, a2cording to the co2mandment of the everlasting God, made known to a2l nations for the obedience of faith: 
To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen. 
Paul ca2led to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the wi2l of God, and Sosthenes our brother, 
Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, ca2led to be saints, with a2l that in every place ca2l upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their's and our's: 
Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. 
I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ; 
That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in a2l u2terance, and in a2l knowledge; 
Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: 
So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: 
Who sha2l also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blamele2s in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
God is faithful, by whom ye were ca2led unto the fe2lowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. 
Now I bes2ech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye a2l speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. 
For it hath b2en declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you. 
Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apo2los; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ. 
Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul? 
I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius; 
Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name. 
And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other. 
For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cro2s of Christ should be made of none e2fect. 
For the preaching of the cro2s is to them that perish f2olishne2s; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. 
For it is wri2ten, I wi2l destroy the wisdom of the wise, and wi2l bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. 
Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made f2olish the wisdom of this world? 
For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the f2olishne2s of preaching to save them that believe. 
For the Jews require a sign, and the Gr2eks s2ek after wisdom: 
But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Gr2eks f2olishne2s; 
But unto them which are ca2led, both Jews and Gr2eks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. 
Because the f2olishne2s of God is wiser than men; and the weakne2s of God is stronger than men. 
For ye s2e your ca2ling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are ca2led: 
But God hath chosen the f2olish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; 
And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: 
That no flesh should glory in his presence. 
But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousne2s, and sanctification, and redemption: 
That, a2cording as it is wri2ten, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. 
And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with exce2lency of sp2ech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. 
For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. 
And I was with you in weakne2s, and in fear, and in much trembling. 
And my sp2ech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: 
That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. 
Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: 
But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hi2den wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: 
Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 
But as it is wri2ten, Eye hath not s2en, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. 
But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth a2l things, yea, the d2ep things of God. 
For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. 
Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are fr2ely given to us of God. 
Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. 
But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are f2olishne2s unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritua2ly discerned. 
But he that is spiritual judgeth a2l things, yet he himself is judged of no man. 
For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? but we have the mind of Christ. 
And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. 
I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. 
For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? 
For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apo2los; are ye not carnal? 
Who then is Paul, and who is Apo2los, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? 
I have planted, Apo2los watered; but God gave the increase. 
So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. 
Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man sha2l receive his own reward a2cording to his own labour. 
For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building. 
A2cording to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take h2ed how he buildeth thereupon. 
For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, w2od, hay, stu2ble; 
Every man's work sha2l be made manifest: for the day sha2l declare it, because it sha2l be revealed by fire; and the fire sha2l try every man's work of what sort it is. 
If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he sha2l receive a reward. 
If any man's work sha2l be burned, he sha2l su2fer lo2s: but he himself sha2l be saved; yet so as by fire. 
Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwe2leth in you? 
If any man defile the temple of God, him sha2l God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. 
Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you s2emeth to be wise in this world, let him become a f2ol, that he may be wise. 
For the wisdom of this world is f2olishne2s with God. For it is wri2ten, He taketh the wise in their own craftine2s. 
And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. 
Therefore let no man glory in men. For a2l things are your's; 
Whether Paul, or Apo2los, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; a2l are your's; 
And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's. 
Let a man so a2count of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. 
Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. 
But with me it is a very sma2l thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. 
For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord. 
Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both wi2l bring to light the hi2den things of darkne2s, and wi2l make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then sha2l every man have praise of God. 
And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transfe2red to myself and to Apo2los for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is wri2ten, that no one of you be pu2fed up for one against another. 
For who maketh th2e to di2fer from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it? 
Now ye are fu2l, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you. 
For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were a2pointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men. 
We are f2ols for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised. 
Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are bu2feted, and have no certain dwe2lingplace; 
And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we ble2s; being persecuted, we su2fer it: 
Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the o2fscouring of a2l things unto this day. 
I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you. 
For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have bego2ten you through the gospel. 
Wherefore I bes2ech you, be ye fo2lowers of me. 
For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who sha2l bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church. 
Now some are pu2fed up, as though I would not come to you. 
But I wi2l come to you shortly, if the Lord wi2l, and wi2l know, not the sp2ech of them which are pu2fed up, but the power. 
For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power. 
What wi2l ye? sha2l I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of m2ekne2s? 
It is reported co2monly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife. 
And ye are pu2fed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this d2ed might be taken away from among you. 
For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this d2ed, 
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. 
Your glorying is not g2od. Know ye not that a li2tle leaven leaveneth the whole lump? 
Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our pa2sover is sacrificed for us: 
Therefore let us k2ep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedne2s; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. 
I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators: 
Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye n2eds go out of the world. 
But now I have wri2ten unto you not to k2ep company, if any man that is ca2led a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolator, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat. 
For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within? 
But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person. 
Dare any of you, having a ma2ter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints? 
Do ye not know that the saints sha2l judge the world? and if the world sha2l be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the sma2lest ma2ters? 
Know ye not that we sha2l judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life? 
If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least est2emed in the church. 
I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that sha2l be able to judge betw2en his brethren? 
But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers. 
Now therefore there is u2terly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather su2fer yourselves to be defrauded? 
Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren. 
Know ye not that the unrighteous sha2l not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor e2feminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, 
Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, sha2l inherit the kingdom of God. 
And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. 
A2l things are lawful unto me, but a2l things are not expedient: a2l things are lawful for me, but I wi2l not be brought under the power of any. 
Meats for the be2ly, and the be2ly for meats: but God sha2l destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. 
And God hath both raised up the Lord, and wi2l also raise up us by his own power. 
Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? sha2l I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid. 
What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, sha2l be one flesh. 
But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. 
Fl2e fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that co2mi2teth fornication si2neth against his own body. 
What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? 
For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's. 
Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is g2od for a man not to touch a woman. 
Neverthele2s, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband. 
Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband. 
The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife. 
Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency. 
But I speak this by permi2sion, and not of co2mandment. 
For I would that a2l men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this ma2ner, and another after that. 
I say therefore to the unma2ried and widows, it is g2od for them if they abide even as I. 
But if they ca2not contain, let them ma2ry: for it is be2ter to ma2ry than to burn. 
And unto the ma2ried I co2mand, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband: 
But and if she depart, let her remain unma2ried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife. 
But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwe2l with him, let him not put her away. 
And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwe2l with her, let her not leave him. 
For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy. 
But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath ca2led us to peace. 
For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife? 
But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath ca2led every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in a2l churches. 
Is any man ca2led being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any ca2led in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. 
Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the k2eping of the co2mandments of God. 
Let every man abide in the same ca2ling wherein he was ca2led. 
Art thou ca2led being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made fr2e, use it rather. 
For he that is ca2led in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's fr2eman: likewise also he that is ca2led, being fr2e, is Christ's servant. 
Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men. 
Brethren, let every man, wherein he is ca2led, therein abide with God. 
Now concerning virgins I have no co2mandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. 
I su2pose therefore that this is g2od for the present distre2s, I say, that it is g2od for a man so to be. 
Art thou bound unto a wife? s2ek not to be l2osed. Art thou l2osed from a wife? s2ek not a wife. 
But and if thou ma2ry, thou hast not si2ned; and if a virgin ma2ry, she hath not si2ned. Neverthele2s such sha2l have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you. 
But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none; 
And they that w2ep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they po2se2sed not; 
And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world pa2seth away. 
But I would have you without carefulne2s. He that is unma2ried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: 
But he that is ma2ried careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife. 
There is di2ference also betw2en a wife and a virgin. The unma2ried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is ma2ried careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. 
And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may a2tend upon the Lord without distraction. 
But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pa2s the flower of her age, and n2ed so require, let him do what he wi2l, he si2neth not: let them ma2ry. 
Neverthele2s he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no nece2sity, but hath power over his own wi2l, and hath so decr2ed in his heart that he wi2l k2ep his virgin, doeth we2l. 
So then he that giveth her in ma2riage doeth we2l; but he that giveth her not in ma2riage doeth be2ter. 
The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be ma2ried to whom she wi2l; only in the Lord. 
But she is ha2pier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God. 
Now as touching things o2fered unto idols, we know that we a2l have knowledge. Knowledge pu2feth up, but charity edifieth. 
And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know. 
But if any man love God, the same is known of him. 
As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are o2fered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one. 
For though there be that are ca2led gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,) 
But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are a2l things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are a2l things, and we by him. 
Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing o2fered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled. 
But meat co2mendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the be2ter; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse. 
But take h2ed lest by any means this liberty of your's become a stumbling block to them that are weak. 
For if any man s2e th2e which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, sha2l not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are o2fered to idols; 
And through thy knowledge sha2l the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died? 
But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ. 
Wherefore, if meat make my brother to o2fend, I wi2l eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to o2fend. 
Am I am not an apostle? am I not fr2e? have I not s2en Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord? 
If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtle2s I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord. 
Mine answer to them that do examine me is this, 
Have we not power to eat and to drink? 
Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as we2l as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? 
Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working? 
Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who f2edeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? 
Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also? 
For it is wri2ten in the law of Moses, thou shalt not mu2zle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen? 
Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is wri2ten: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope. 
If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we sha2l reap your carnal things? 
If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Neverthele2s we have not used this power; but su2fer a2l things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ. 
Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? 
Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel. 
But I have used none of these things: neither have I wri2ten these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were be2ter for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void. 
For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for nece2sity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! 
For if I do this thing wi2lingly, I have a reward: but if against my wi2l, a dispensation of the gospel is co2mi2ted unto me. 
What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel. 
For though I be fr2e from a2l men, yet have I made myself servant unto a2l, that I might gain the more. 
And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; 
To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law. 
To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made a2l things to a2l men, that I might by a2l means save some. 
And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you. 
Know ye not that they which run in a race run a2l, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. 
And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in a2l things. Now they do it to obtain a co2ruptible crown; but we an inco2ruptible. 
I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: 
But I k2ep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway. 
Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that a2l our fathers were under the cloud, and a2l pa2sed through the sea; 
And were a2l baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; 
And did a2l eat the same spiritual meat; 
And did a2l drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that fo2lowed them: and that Rock was Christ. 
But with many of them God was not we2l pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderne2s. 
Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted. 
Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is wri2ten, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. 
Neither let us co2mit fornication, as some of them co2mi2ted, and fe2l in one day thr2e and twenty thousand. 
Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents. 
Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer. 
Now a2l these things ha2pened unto them for ensamples: and they are wri2ten for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. 
Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take h2ed lest he fa2l. 
There hath no temptation taken you but such as is co2mon to man: but God is faithful, who wi2l not su2fer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but wi2l with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it. 
Wherefore, my dearly beloved, fl2e from idolatry. 
I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. 
The cup of ble2sing which we ble2s, is it not the co2munion of the bl2od of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the co2munion of the body of Christ? 
For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are a2l partakers of that one bread. 
Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar? 
What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is o2fered in sacrifice to idols is any thing? 
But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fe2lowship with devils. 
Ye ca2not drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye ca2not be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils. 
Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he? 
A2l things are lawful for me, but a2l things are not expedient: a2l things are lawful for me, but a2l things edify not. 
Let no man s2ek his own, but every man another's wealth. 
Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake: 
For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulne2s thereof. 
If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake. 
But if any man say unto you, this is o2fered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulne2s thereof: 
Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience? 
For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks? 
Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do a2l to the glory of God. 
Give none o2fence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God: 
Even as I please a2l men in a2l things, not s2eking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved. 
Be ye fo2lowers of me, even as I also am of Christ. 
Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in a2l things, and k2ep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you. 
But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. 
Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head. 
But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even a2l one as if she were shaven. 
For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. 
For a man ind2ed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. 
For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man. 
Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man. 
For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels. 
Neverthele2s neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord. 
For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but a2l things of God. 
Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered? 
Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? 
But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. 
But if any man s2em to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God. 
Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the be2ter, but for the worse. 
For first of a2l, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. 
For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are a2proved may be made manifest among you. 
When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's su2per. 
For in eating every one taketh before other his own su2per: and one is hungry, and another is drunken. 
What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? what sha2l I say to you? sha2l I praise you in this? I praise you not. 
For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed t2ok bread: 
And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. 
After the same ma2ner also he t2ok the cup, when he had su2ped, saying, this cup is the new testament in my bl2od: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. 
For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death ti2l he come. 
Wherefore whosoever sha2l eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, sha2l be guilty of the body and bl2od of the Lord. 
But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. 
For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. 
For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sl2ep. 
For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. 
But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. 
Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, ta2ry one for another. 
And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest wi2l I set in order when I come. 
Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. 
Ye know that ye were Gentiles, ca2ried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led. 
Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God ca2leth Jesus a2cursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. 
Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 
And there are di2ferences of administrations, but the same Lord. 
And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh a2l in a2l. 
But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. 
For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; 
To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; 
To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: 
But a2l these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severa2ly as he wi2l. 
For as the body is one, and hath many members, and a2l the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ. 
For by one Spirit are we a2l baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or fr2e; and have b2en a2l made to drink into one Spirit. 
For the body is not one member, but many. 
If the f2ot sha2l say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? 
And if the ear sha2l say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? 
If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the sme2ling? 
But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him. 
And if they were a2l one member, where were the body? 
But now are they many members, yet but one body. 
And the eye ca2not say unto the hand, I have no n2ed of th2e: nor again the head to the f2et, I have no n2ed of you. 
Nay, much more those members of the body, which s2em to be more f2eble, are nece2sary: 
And those members of the body, which we think to be le2s honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeline2s. 
For our comely parts have no n2ed: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked. 
That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. 
And whether one member su2fer, a2l the members su2fer with it; or one member be honoured, a2l the members rejoice with it. 
Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. 
And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. 
Are a2l apostles? are a2l prophets? are a2l teachers? are a2l workers of miracles? 
Have a2l the gifts of healing? do a2l speak with tongues? do a2l interpret? 
But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more exce2lent way. 
Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding bra2s, or a tinkling cymbal. 
And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand a2l mysteries, and a2l knowledge; and though I have a2l faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 
And though I bestow a2l my g2ods to f2ed the p2or, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. 
Charity su2fereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not pu2fed up, 
Doth not behave itself uns2emly, s2eketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; 
Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; 
Beareth a2l things, believeth a2l things, hopeth a2l things, endureth a2l things. 
Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they sha2l fail; whether there be tongues, they sha2l cease; whether there be knowledge, it sha2l vanish away. 
For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. 
But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part sha2l be done away. 
When I was a child, I spake as a child, I underst2od as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. 
For now we s2e through a gla2s, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then sha2l I know even as also I am known. 
And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these thr2e; but the greatest of these is charity. 
Fo2low after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy. 
For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries. 
But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort. 
He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church. 
I would that ye a2l spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying. 
Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what sha2l I profit you, except I sha2l speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine? 
And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how sha2l it be known what is piped or harped? 
For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who sha2l prepare himself to the ba2tle? 
So likewise ye, except ye u2ter by the tongue words easy to be underst2od, how sha2l it be known what is spoken? for ye sha2l speak into the air. 
There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification. 
Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I sha2l be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh sha2l be a barbarian unto me. 
Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, s2ek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church. 
Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret. 
For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful. 
What is it then? I wi2l pray with the spirit, and I wi2l pray with the understanding also: I wi2l sing with the spirit, and I wi2l sing with the understanding also. 
Else when thou shalt ble2s with the spirit, how sha2l he that o2cupieth the r2om of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, s2eing he understandeth not what thou sayest? 
For thou verily givest thanks we2l, but the other is not edified. 
I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye a2l: 
Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue. 
Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men. 
In the law it is wri2ten, With men of other tongues and other lips wi2l I speak unto this people; and yet for a2l that wi2l they not hear me, saith the Lord. 
Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe. 
If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and a2l speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, wi2l they not say that ye are mad? 
But if a2l prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of a2l, he is judged of a2l: 
And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so fa2ling down on his face he wi2l worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth. 
How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let a2l things be done unto edifying. 
If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by thr2e, and that by course; and let one interpret. 
But if there be no interpreter, let him k2ep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God. 
Let the prophets speak two or thr2e, and let the other judge. 
If any thing be revealed to another that si2teth by, let the first hold his peace. 
For ye may a2l prophesy one by one, that a2l may learn, and a2l may be comforted. 
And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. 
For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in a2l churches of the saints. 
Let your women k2ep silence in the churches: for it is not permi2ted unto them to speak; but they are co2manded to be under obedience as also saith the law. 
And if they wi2l learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church. 
What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only? 
If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the co2mandments of the Lord. 
But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant. 
Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues. 
Let a2l things be done decently and in order. 
Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
By which also ye are saved, if ye k2ep in memory what I preached unto you, unle2s ye have believed in vain. 
For I delivered unto you first of a2l that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins a2cording to the scriptures; 
And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day a2cording to the scriptures: 
And that he was s2en of Cephas, then of the twelve: 
After that, he was s2en of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fa2len asl2ep. 
After that, he was s2en of James; then of a2l the apostles. 
And last of a2l he was s2en of me also, as of one born out of due time. 
For I am the least of the apostles, that am not m2et to be ca2led an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 
But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they a2l: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. 
Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed. 
Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resu2rection of the dead? 
But if there be no resu2rection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: 
And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. 
Yea, and we are found false witne2ses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. 
For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: 
And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. 
Then they also which are fa2len asl2ep in Christ are perished. 
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of a2l men most miserable. 
But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept. 
For since by man came death, by man came also the resu2rection of the dead. 
For as in Adam a2l die, even so in Christ sha2l a2l be made alive. 
But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming. 
Then cometh the end, when he sha2l have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he sha2l have put down a2l rule and a2l authority and power. 
For he must reign, ti2l he hath put a2l enemies under his f2et. 
The last enemy that sha2l be destroyed is death. 
For he hath put a2l things under his f2et. But when he saith a2l things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put a2l things under him. 
And when a2l things sha2l be subdued unto him, then sha2l the Son also himself be subject unto him that put a2l things under him, that God may be a2l in a2l. 
Else what sha2l they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at a2l? why are they then baptized for the dead? 
And why stand we in jeopardy every hour? 
I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. 
If after the ma2ner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to mo2row we die. 
Be not deceived: evil co2munications co2rupt g2od ma2ners. 
Awake to righteousne2s, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame. 
But some man wi2l say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come? 
Thou f2ol, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die: 
And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that sha2l be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain: 
But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every s2ed his own body. 
A2l flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds. 
There are also celestial bodies, and bodies te2restrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the te2restrial is another. 
There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the m2on, and another glory of the stars: for one star di2fereth from another star in glory. 
So also is the resu2rection of the dead. It is sown in co2ruption; it is raised in inco2ruption: 
It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakne2s; it is raised in power: 
It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. 
And so it is wri2ten, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit. 
Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. 
The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven. 
As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. 
And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we sha2l also bear the image of the heavenly. 
Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and bl2od ca2not inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth co2ruption inherit inco2ruption. 
Behold, I shew you a mystery; We sha2l not a2l sl2ep, but we sha2l a2l be changed, 
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet sha2l sound, and the dead sha2l be raised inco2ruptible, and we sha2l be changed. 
For this co2ruptible must put on inco2ruption, and this mortal must put on i2mortality. 
So when this co2ruptible sha2l have put on inco2ruption, and this mortal sha2l have put on i2mortality, then sha2l be brought to pa2s the saying that is wri2ten, Death is swa2lowed up in victory. 
O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? 
The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. 
But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord. 
Now concerning the co2lection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. 
Upon the first day of the w2ek let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come. 
And when I come, whomsoever ye sha2l a2prove by your le2ters, them wi2l I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. 
And if it be m2et that I go also, they sha2l go with me. 
Now I wi2l come unto you, when I sha2l pa2s through Macedonia: for I do pa2s through Macedonia. 
And it may be that I wi2l abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go. 
For I wi2l not s2e you now by the way; but I trust to ta2ry a while with you, if the Lord permit. 
But I wi2l ta2ry at Ephesus until Pentecost. 
For a great d2or and e2fectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries. 
Now if Timotheus come, s2e that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do. 
Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I l2ok for him with the brethren. 
As touching our brother Apo2los, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his wi2l was not at a2l to come at this time; but he wi2l come when he sha2l have convenient time. 
Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. 
Let a2l your things be done with charity. 
I bes2ech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have a2dicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,) 
That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth. 
I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have su2plied. 
For they have refreshed my spirit and your's: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such. 
The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Prisci2la salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house. 
A2l the brethren gr2et you. Gr2et ye one another with an holy ki2s. 
The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand. 
If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 
My love be with you a2l in Christ Jesus. Amen. 
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the wi2l of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with a2l the saints which are in a2l Achaia: 
Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Ble2sed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of a2l comfort; 
Who comforteth us in a2l our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. 
For as the su2ferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ. 
And whether we be a2flicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is e2fectual in the enduring of the same su2ferings which we also su2fer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation. 
And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the su2ferings, so sha2l ye be also of the consolation. 
For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pre2sed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life: 
But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: 
Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he wi2l yet deliver us; 
Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf. 
For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward. 
For we write none other things unto you, that what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye sha2l acknowledge even to the end; 
As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus. 
And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit; 
And to pa2s by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea. 
When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightne2s? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose a2cording to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay? 
But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay. 
For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea. 
For a2l the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us. 
Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; 
Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. 
Moreover I ca2l God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth. 
Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand. 
But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heavine2s. 
For if I make you so2ry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made so2ry by me? 
And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have so2row from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you a2l, that my joy is the joy of you a2l. 
For out of much a2fliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you. 
But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you a2l. 
Su2ficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many. 
So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swa2lowed up with overmuch so2row. 
Wherefore I bes2ech you that ye would confirm your love toward him. 
For to this end also did I write, that I might know the pr2of of you, whether ye be obedient in a2l things. 
To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ; 
Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices. 
Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a d2or was opened unto me of the Lord, 
I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia. 
Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. 
For we are unto God a sw2et savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: 
To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is su2ficient for these things? 
For we are not as many, which co2rupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ. 
Do we begin again to co2mend ourselves? or n2ed we, as some others, epistles of co2mendation to you, or le2ters of co2mendation from you? 
Ye are our epistle wri2ten in our hearts, known and read of a2l men: 
Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, wri2ten not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart. 
And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: 
Not that we are su2ficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our su2ficiency is of God; 
Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the le2ter, but of the spirit: for the le2ter ki2leth, but the spirit giveth life. 
But if the ministration of death, wri2ten and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away: 
How sha2l not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? 
For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousne2s exc2ed in glory. 
For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that exce2leth. 
For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious. 
S2eing then that we have such hope, we use great plai2ne2s of sp2ech: 
And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly l2ok to the end of that which is abolished: 
But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ. 
But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart. 
Neverthele2s when it sha2l turn to the Lord, the vail sha2l be taken away. 
Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. 
But we a2l, with open face beholding as in a gla2s the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. 
Therefore s2eing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not; 
But have renounced the hi2den things of dishonesty, not walking in craftine2s, nor handling the word of God deceitfu2ly; but by manifestation of the truth co2mending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. 
But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: 
In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. 
For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. 
For God, who co2manded the light to shine out of darkne2s, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. 
But we have this treasure in earthen ve2sels, that the exce2lency of the power may be of God, and not of us. 
We are troubled on every side, yet not distre2sed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; 
Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; 
Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. 
For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. 
So then death worketh in us, but life in you. 
We having the same spirit of faith, a2cording as it is wri2ten, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak; 
Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus sha2l raise up us also by Jesus, and sha2l present us with you. 
For a2l things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God. 
For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. 
For our light a2fliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exc2eding and eternal weight of glory; 
While we l2ok not at the things which are s2en, but at the things which are not s2en: for the things which are s2en are temporal; but the things which are not s2en are eternal. 
For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were di2solved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. 
For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: 
If so be that being clothed we sha2l not be found naked. 
For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swa2lowed up of life. 
Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. 
Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: 
(For we walk by faith, not by sight:) 
We are confident, I say, and wi2ling rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord. 
Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be a2cepted of him. 
For we must a2l a2pear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, a2cording to that he hath done, whether it be g2od or bad. 
Knowing therefore the te2ror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences. 
For we co2mend not ourselves again unto you, but give you o2casion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in a2pearance, and not in heart. 
For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause. 
For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for a2l, then were a2l dead: 
And that he died for a2l, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. 
Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more. 
Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are pa2sed away; behold, a2l things are become new. 
And a2l things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; 
To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespa2ses unto them; and hath co2mi2ted unto us the word of reconciliation. 
Now then we are amba2sadors for Christ, as though God did bes2ech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. 
For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousne2s of God in him. 
We then, as workers together with him, bes2ech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. 
(For he saith, I have heard th2e in a time a2cepted, and in the day of salvation have I su2coured th2e: behold, now is the a2cepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.) 
Giving no o2fence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed: 
But in a2l things a2proving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in a2flictions, in nece2sities, in distre2ses, 
In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings; 
By purene2s, by knowledge, by long su2fering, by kindne2s, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, 
By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousne2s on the right hand and on the left, 
By honour and dishonour, by evil report and g2od report: as deceivers, and yet true; 
As unknown, and yet we2l known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not ki2led; 
As so2rowful, yet alway rejoicing; as p2or, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet po2se2sing a2l things. 
O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged. 
Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels. 
Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged. 
Be ye not unequa2ly yoked together with unbelievers: for what fe2lowship hath righteousne2s with unrighteousne2s? and what co2munion hath light with darkne2s? 
And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? 
And what agr2ement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I wi2l dwe2l in them, and walk in them; and I wi2l be their God, and they sha2l be my people. 
Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I wi2l receive you. 
And wi2l be a Father unto you, and ye sha2l be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. 
Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from a2l filthine2s of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holine2s in the fear of God. 
Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have co2rupted no man, we have defrauded no man. 
I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you. 
Great is my boldne2s of sp2ech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am fi2led with comfort, I am exc2eding joyful in a2l our tribulation. 
For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears. 
Neverthele2s God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus; 
And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more. 
For though I made you so2ry with a le2ter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you so2ry, though it were but for a season. 
Now I rejoice, not that ye were made so2ry, but that ye so2rowed to repentance: for ye were made so2ry after a godly ma2ner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing. 
For godly so2row worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the so2row of the world worketh death. 
For behold this selfsame thing, that ye so2rowed after a godly sort, what carefulne2s it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In a2l things ye have a2proved yourselves to be clear in this ma2ter. 
Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that su2fered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might a2pear unto you. 
Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exc2edingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you a2l. 
For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake a2l things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth. 
And his inward a2fection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you a2l, how with fear and trembling ye received him. 
I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in a2l things. 
Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia; 
How that in a great trial of a2fliction the abundance of their joy and their d2ep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. 
For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were wi2ling of themselves; 
Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fe2lowship of the ministering to the saints. 
And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the wi2l of God. 
Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also. 
Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and u2terance, and knowledge, and in a2l diligence, and in your love to us, s2e that ye abound in this grace also. 
I speak not by co2mandment, but by o2casion of the forwardne2s of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love. 
For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became p2or, that ye through his poverty might be rich. 
And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago. 
Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readine2s to wi2l, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have. 
For it there be first a wi2ling mind, it is a2cepted a2cording to that a man hath, and not a2cording to that he hath not. 
For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened: 
But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a su2ply for their want, that their abundance also may be a su2ply for your want: that there may be equality: 
As it is wri2ten, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered li2tle had no lack. 
But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you. 
For ind2ed he a2cepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own a2cord he went unto you. 
And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout a2l the churches; 
And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind: 
Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us: 
Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. 
And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you. 
Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fe2lowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the me2sengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ. 
Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the pr2of of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf. 
For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you: 
For I know the forwardne2s of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many. 
Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready: 
Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting. 
Therefore I thought it nece2sary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a ma2ter of bounty, and not as of covetousne2s. 
But this I say, He which soweth sparingly sha2l reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifu2ly sha2l reap also bountifu2ly. 
Every man a2cording as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of nece2sity: for God loveth a ch2erful giver. 
And God is able to make a2l grace abound toward you; that ye, always having a2l su2ficiency in a2l things, may abound to every g2od work: 
(As it is wri2ten, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the p2or: his righteousne2s remaineth for ever. 
Now he that ministereth s2ed to the sower both minister bread for your f2od, and multiply your s2ed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousne2s;) 
Being enriched in every thing to a2l bountifulne2s, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God. 
For the administration of this service not only su2plieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God; 
Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your profe2sed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto a2l men; 
And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exc2eding grace of God in you. 
Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift. 
Now I Paul myself bes2ech you by the m2ekne2s and gentlene2s of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you: 
But I bes2ech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked a2cording to the flesh. 
For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: 
(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pu2ling down of strong holds;) 
Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; 
And having in a readine2s to revenge a2l disobedience, when your obedience is fulfi2led. 
Do ye l2ok on things after the outward a2pearance? if any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's. 
For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed: 
That I may not s2em as if I would te2rify you by le2ters. 
For his le2ters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his sp2ech contemptible. 
Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by le2ters when we are absent, such wi2l we be also in d2ed when we are present. 
For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that co2mend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise. 
But we wi2l not boast of things without our measure, but a2cording to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you. 
For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ: 
Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we sha2l be enlarged by you a2cording to our rule abundantly, 
To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand. 
But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. 
For not he that co2mendeth himself is a2proved, but whom the Lord co2mendeth. 
Would to God ye could bear with me a li2tle in my fo2ly: and ind2ed bear with me. 
For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. 
But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be co2rupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. 
For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not a2cepted, ye might we2l bear with him. 
For I su2pose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. 
But though I be rude in sp2ech, yet not in knowledge; but we have b2en throughly made manifest among you in a2l things. 
Have I co2mi2ted an o2fence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God fr2ely? 
I ro2bed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service. 
And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia su2plied: and in a2l things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so wi2l I k2ep myself. 
As the truth of Christ is in me, no man sha2l stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia. 
Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth. 
But what I do, that I wi2l do, that I may cut o2f o2casion from them which desire o2casion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. 
For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. 
And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. 
Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousne2s; whose end sha2l be a2cording to their works. 
I say again, let no man think me a f2ol; if otherwise, yet as a f2ol receive me, that I may boast myself a li2tle. 
That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were f2olishly, in this confidence of boasting. 
S2eing that many glory after the flesh, I wi2l glory also. 
For ye su2fer f2ols gladly, s2eing ye yourselves are wise. 
For ye su2fer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face. 
I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had b2en weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak f2olishly,) I am bold also. 
Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the s2ed of Abraham? so am I. 
Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a f2ol) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft. 
Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one. 
Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I su2fered shipwreck, a night and a day I have b2en in the d2ep; 
In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of ro2bers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderne2s, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; 
In wearine2s and painfulne2s, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedne2s. 
Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of a2l the churches. 
Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is o2fended, and I burn not? 
If I must n2eds glory, I wi2l glory of the things which concern mine infirmities. 
The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is ble2sed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not. 
In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the damascenes with a ga2rison, desirous to a2prehend me: 
And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wa2l, and escaped his hands. 
It is not expedient for me doubtle2s to glory. I wi2l come to visions and revelations of the Lord. 
I knew a man in Christ above fourt2en years ago, (whether in the body, I ca2not te2l; or whether out of the body, I ca2not te2l: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven. 
And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I ca2not te2l: God knoweth;) 
How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to u2ter. 
Of such an one wi2l I glory: yet of myself I wi2l not glory, but in mine infirmities. 
For though I would desire to glory, I sha2l not be a f2ol; for I wi2l say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he s2eth me to be, or that he heareth of me. 
And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the me2senger of Satan to bu2fet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. 
For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. 
And he said unto me, My grace is su2ficient for th2e: for my strength is made perfect in weakne2s. Most gladly therefore wi2l I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 
Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in nece2sities, in persecutions, in distre2ses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong. 
I am become a f2ol in glorying; ye have compe2led me: for I ought to have b2en co2mended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing. 
Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in a2l patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty d2eds. 
For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong. 
Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I wi2l not be burdensome to you: for I s2ek not your's but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. 
And I wi2l very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the le2s I be loved. 
But be it so, I did not burden you: neverthele2s, being crafty, I caught you with guile. 
Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you? 
I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps? 
Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do a2l things, dearly beloved, for your edifying. 
For I fear, lest, when I come, I sha2l not find you such as I would, and that I sha2l be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swe2lings, tumults: 
And lest, when I come again, my God wi2l humble me among you, and that I sha2l bewail many which have si2ned already, and have not repented of the unclea2ne2s and fornication and lasciviousne2s which they have co2mi2ted. 
This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or thr2e witne2ses sha2l every word be established. 
I told you before, and forete2l you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have si2ned, and to a2l other, that, if I come again, I wi2l not spare: 
Since ye s2ek a pr2of of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you. 
For though he was crucified through weakne2s, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we sha2l live with him by the power of God toward you. 
Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates? 
But I trust that ye sha2l know that we are not reprobates. 
Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should a2pear a2proved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates. 
For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. 
For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection. 
Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpne2s, a2cording to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction. 
Fina2ly, brethren, farewe2l. Be perfect, be of g2od comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace sha2l be with you. 
Gr2et one another with an holy ki2s. 
A2l the saints salute you. 
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the co2munion of the Holy Ghost, be with you a2l. Amen. 
Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) 
And a2l the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia: 
Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, a2cording to the wi2l of God and our Father: 
To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
I marvel that ye are so s2on removed from him that ca2led you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 
Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. 
But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be a2cursed. 
As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be a2cursed. 
For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I s2ek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. 
But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. 
For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. 
For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: 
And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exc2edingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. 
But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and ca2led me by his grace, 
To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; i2mediately I confe2red not with flesh and bl2od: 
Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus. 
Then after thr2e years I went up to Jerusalem to s2e Peter, and abode with him fift2en days. 
But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother. 
Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. 
Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; 
And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ: 
But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. 
And they glorified God in me. 
Then fourt2en years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and t2ok Titus with me also. 
And I went up by revelation, and co2municated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain. 
But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Gr2ek, was compe2led to be circumcised: 
And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage: 
To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you. 
But of these who s2emed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no ma2ter to me: God a2cepteth no man's person:) for they who s2emed to be somewhat in conference a2ded nothing to me: 
But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was co2mi2ted unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter; 
(For he that wrought e2fectua2ly in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:) 
And when James, Cephas, and John, who s2emed to be pi2lars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fe2lowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision. 
Only they would that we should remember the p2or; the same which I also was forward to do. 
But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withst2od him to the face, because he was to be blamed. 
For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision. 
And the other Jews di2sembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was ca2ried away with their di2simulation. 
But when I saw that they walked not uprightly a2cording to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them a2l, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the ma2ner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compe2lest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews? 
We who are Jews by nature, and not si2ners of the Gentiles, 
Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law sha2l no flesh be justified. 
But if, while we s2ek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found si2ners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid. 
For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgre2sor. 
For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God. 
I am crucified with Christ: neverthle2s I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. 
I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousne2s come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. 
O f2olish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath b2en evidently set forth, crucified among you? 
This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
Are ye so f2olish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? 
Have ye su2fered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain. 
He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
Even as Abraham believed God, and it was a2counted to him for righteousne2s. 
Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. 
And the scripture, fores2eing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In th2e sha2l a2l nations be ble2sed. 
So then they which be of faith are ble2sed with faithful Abraham. 
For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is wri2ten, Cursed is every one that continueth not in a2l things which are wri2ten in the b2ok of the law to do them. 
But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just sha2l live by faith. 
And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them sha2l live in them. 
Christ hath red2emed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is wri2ten, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tr2e: 
That the ble2sing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. 
Brethren, I speak after the ma2ner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disa2nu2leth, or a2deth thereto. 
Now to Abraham and his s2ed were the promises made. He saith not, And to s2eds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy s2ed, which is Christ. 
And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, ca2not disa2nul, that it should make the promise of none e2fect. 
For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise. 
Wherefore then serveth the law? It was a2ded because of transgre2sions, ti2l the s2ed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. 
Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one. 
Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had b2en a law given which could have given life, verily righteousne2s should have b2en by the law. 
But the scripture hath concluded a2l under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. 
But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. 
Wherefore the law was our sch2olmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. 
But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a sch2olmaster. 
For ye are a2l the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. 
For as many of you as have b2en baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 
There is neither Jew nor Gr2ek, there is neither bond nor fr2e, there is neither male nor female: for ye are a2l one in Christ Jesus. 
And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's s2ed, and heirs a2cording to the promise. 
Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, di2fereth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of a2l; 
But is under tutors and governors until the time a2pointed of the father. 
Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world: 
But when the fulne2s of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, 
To red2em them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. 
And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, A2ba, Father. 
Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. 
Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods. 
But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and be2garly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? 
Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. 
I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain. 
Brethren, I bes2ech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at a2l. 
Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first. 
And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. 
Where is then the ble2sedne2s ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had b2en po2sible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me. 
Am I therefore become your enemy, because I te2l you the truth? 
They zealously a2fect you, but not we2l; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might a2fect them. 
But it is g2od to be zealously a2fected always in a g2od thing, and not only when I am present with you. 
My li2tle children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you, 
I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you. 
Te2l me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? 
For it is wri2ten, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a fr2ewoman. 
But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the fr2ewoman was by promise. 
Which things are an a2legory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar. 
For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children. 
But Jerusalem which is above is fr2e, which is the mother of us a2l. 
For it is wri2ten, Rejoice, thou ba2ren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband. 
Now we, brethren, as Is2ac was, are the children of promise. 
But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now. 
Neverthele2s what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman sha2l not be heir with the son of the fr2ewoman. 
So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the fr2e. 
Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us fr2e, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. 
Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ sha2l profit you nothing. 
For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. 
Christ is become of no e2fect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fa2len from grace. 
For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousne2s by faith. 
For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. 
Ye did run we2l; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? 
This persuasion cometh not of him that ca2leth you. 
A li2tle leaven leaveneth the whole lump. 
I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye wi2l be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you sha2l bear his judgment, whosoever he be. 
And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet su2fer persecution? then is the o2fence of the cro2s ceased. 
I would they were even cut o2f which trouble you. 
For, brethren, ye have b2en ca2led unto liberty; only use not liberty for an o2casion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. 
For a2l the law is fulfi2led in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 
But if ye bite and devour one another, take h2ed that ye be not consumed one of another. 
This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye sha2l not fulfil the lust of the flesh. 
For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye ca2not do the things that ye would. 
But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. 
Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, unclea2ne2s, lasciviousne2s, 
Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, 
Envyings, murders, drunke2ne2s, reve2lings, and such like: of the which I te2l you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things sha2l not inherit the kingdom of God. 
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsu2fering, gentlene2s, g2odne2s, faith, 
M2ekne2s, temperance: against such there is no law. 
And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the a2fections and lusts. 
If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. 
Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another. 
Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of m2ekne2s; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. 
Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. 
For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. 
But let every man prove his own work, and then sha2l he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. 
For every man sha2l bear his own burden. 
Let him that is taught in the word co2municate unto him that teacheth in a2l g2od things. 
Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that sha2l he also reap. 
For he that soweth to his flesh sha2l of the flesh reap co2ruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit sha2l of the Spirit reap life everlasting. 
And let us not be weary in we2l doing: for in due season we sha2l reap, if we faint not. 
As we have therefore o2portunity, let us do g2od unto a2l men, especia2ly unto them who are of the household of faith. 
Ye s2e how large a le2ter I have wri2ten unto you with mine own hand. 
As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should su2fer persecution for the cro2s of Christ. 
For neither they themselves who are circumcised k2ep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. 
But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cro2s of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. 
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. 
And as many as walk a2cording to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. 
From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. 
Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. 
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the wi2l of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus: 
Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Ble2sed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath ble2sed us with a2l spiritual ble2sings in heavenly places in Christ: 
A2cording as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: 
Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, a2cording to the g2od pleasure of his wi2l, 
To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us a2cepted in the beloved. 
In whom we have redemption through his bl2od, the forgivene2s of sins, a2cording to the riches of his grace; 
Wherein he hath abounded toward us in a2l wisdom and prudence; 
Having made known unto us the mystery of his wi2l, a2cording to his g2od pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: 
That in the dispensation of the fulne2s of times he might gather together in one a2l things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him: 
In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated a2cording to the purpose of him who worketh a2l things after the counsel of his own wi2l: 
That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ. 
In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, 
Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased po2se2sion, unto the praise of his glory. 
Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto a2l the saints, 
Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; 
That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: 
The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his ca2ling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, 
And what is the exc2eding greatne2s of his power to us-ward who believe, a2cording to the working of his mighty power, 
Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, 
Far above a2l principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: 
And hath put a2l things under his f2et, and gave him to be the head over a2l things to the church, 
Which is his body, the fulne2s of him that fi2leth a2l in a2l. 
And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespa2ses and sins; 
Wherein in time past ye walked a2cording to the course of this world, a2cording to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience: 
Among whom also we a2l had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfi2ling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others. 
But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, 
Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) 
And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: 
That in the ages to come he might shew the exc2eding riches of his grace in his kindne2s toward us through Christ Jesus. 
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 
Not of works, lest any man should boast. 
For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto g2od works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. 
Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are ca2led Uncircumcision by that which is ca2led the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands; 
That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the co2monwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world: 
But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far o2f are made nigh by the bl2od of Christ. 
For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the mi2dle wa2l of partition betw2en us; 
Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of co2mandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace; 
And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cro2s, having slain the enmity thereby: 
And came and preached peace to you which were afar o2f, and to them that were nigh. 
For through him we both have a2ce2s by one Spirit unto the Father. 
Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fe2lowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God; 
And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; 
In whom a2l the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: 
In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit. 
For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles, 
If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward: 
How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words, 
Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ) 
Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; 
That the Gentiles should be fe2lowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel: 
Whereof I was made a minister, a2cording to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the e2fectual working of his power. 
Unto me, who am le2s than the least of a2l saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; 
And to make a2l men s2e what is the fe2lowship of the mystery, which from the begi2ning of the world hath b2en hid in God, who created a2l things by Jesus Christ: 
To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, 
A2cording to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: 
In whom we have boldne2s and a2ce2s with confidence by the faith of him. 
Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory. 
For this cause I bow my kn2es unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, 
That he would grant you, a2cording to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the i2ner man; 
That Christ may dwe2l in your hearts by faith; that ye, being r2oted and grounded in love, 
May be able to comprehend with a2l saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; 
And to know the love of Christ, which pa2seth knowledge, that ye might be fi2led with a2l the fulne2s of God. 
Now unto him that is able to do exc2eding abundantly above a2l that we ask or think, a2cording to the power that worketh in us, 
Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout a2l ages, world without end. Amen. 
I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, bes2ech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are ca2led, 
With a2l lowline2s and m2ekne2s, with longsu2fering, forbearing one another in love; 
Endeavouring to k2ep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 
There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are ca2led in one hope of your ca2ling; 
One Lord, one faith, one baptism, 
One God and Father of a2l, who is above a2l, and through a2l, and in you a2l. 
But unto every one of us is given grace a2cording to the measure of the gift of Christ. 
Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. 
(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? 
He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above a2l heavens, that he might fi2l a2l things.) 
And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 
For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: 
Ti2l we a2l come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulne2s of Christ: 
That we henceforth be no more children, to2sed to and fro, and ca2ried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cu2ning craftine2s, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; 
But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in a2l things, which is the head, even Christ: 
From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint su2plieth, a2cording to the e2fectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love. 
This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind, 
Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindne2s of their heart: 
Who being past f2eling have given themselves over unto lasciviousne2s, to work a2l unclea2ne2s with gr2edine2s. 
But ye have not so learned Christ; 
If so be that ye have heard him, and have b2en taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus: 
That ye put o2f concerning the former conversation the old man, which is co2rupt a2cording to the deceitful lusts; 
And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; 
And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousne2s and true holine2s. 
Wherefore pu2ting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another. 
Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: 
Neither give place to the devil. 
Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is g2od, that he may have to give to him that n2edeth. 
Let no co2rupt co2munication proc2ed out of your mouth, but that which is g2od to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. 
And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. 
Let a2l bi2terne2s, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with a2l malice: 
And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you. 
Be ye therefore fo2lowers of God, as dear children; 
And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an o2fering and a sacrifice to God for a sw2etsme2ling savour. 
But fornication, and a2l unclea2ne2s, or covetousne2s, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; 
Neither filthine2s, nor f2olish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. 
For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 
Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. 
Be not ye therefore partakers with them. 
For ye were sometimes darkne2s, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light: 
(For the fruit of the Spirit is in a2l g2odne2s and righteousne2s and truth;) 
Proving what is a2ceptable unto the Lord. 
And have no fe2lowship with the unfruitful works of darkne2s, but rather reprove them. 
For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. 
But a2l things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. 
Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sl2epest, and arise from the dead, and Christ sha2l give th2e light. 
S2e then that ye walk circumspectly, not as f2ols, but as wise, 
Red2eming the time, because the days are evil. 
Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the wi2l of the Lord is. 
And be not drunk with wine, wherein is exce2s; but be fi2led with the Spirit; 
Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; 
Giving thanks always for a2l things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; 
Submi2ting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. 
Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. 
For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. 
Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. 
Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; 
That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, 
That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. 
So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. 
For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: 
For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. 
For this cause sha2l a man leave his father and mother, and sha2l be joined unto his wife, and they two sha2l be one flesh. 
This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. 
Neverthele2s let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife s2e that she reverence her husband. 
Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. 
Honour thy father and mother; which is the first co2mandment with promise; 
That it may be we2l with th2e, and thou mayest live long on the earth. 
And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. 
Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters a2cording to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singlene2s of your heart, as unto Christ; 
Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the wi2l of God from the heart; 
With g2od wi2l doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: 
Knowing that whatsoever g2od thing any man doeth, the same sha2l he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or fr2e. 
And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him. 
Fina2ly, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. 
Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 
For we wrestle not against flesh and bl2od, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkne2s of this world, against spiritual wickedne2s in high places. 
Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done a2l, to stand. 
Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousne2s; 
And your f2et shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 
Above a2l, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye sha2l be able to quench a2l the fiery darts of the wicked. 
And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God: 
Praying always with a2l prayer and su2plication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with a2l perseverance and su2plication for a2l saints; 
And for me, that u2terance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, 
For which I am an amba2sador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. 
But that ye also may know my a2fairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, sha2l make known to you a2l things: 
Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our a2fairs, and that he might comfort your hearts. 
Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Grace be with a2l them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen. 
Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to a2l the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Phili2pi, with the bishops and deacons: 
Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. 
I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, 
Always in every prayer of mine for you a2l making request with joy, 
For your fe2lowship in the gospel from the first day until now; 
Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a g2od work in you wi2l perform it until the day of Jesus Christ: 
Even as it is m2et for me to think this of you a2l, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye a2l are partakers of my grace. 
For God is my record, how greatly I long after you a2l in the bowels of Jesus Christ. 
And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in a2l judgment; 
That ye may a2prove things that are exce2lent; that ye may be sincere and without o2fence ti2l the day of Christ. 
Being fi2led with the fruits of righteousne2s, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God. 
But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which ha2pened unto me have fa2len out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel; 
So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in a2l the palace, and in a2l other places; 
And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. 
Some ind2ed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of g2od wi2l: 
The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, su2posing to a2d a2fliction to my bonds: 
But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel. 
What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and wi2l rejoice. 
For I know that this sha2l turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the su2ply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 
A2cording to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I sha2l be ashamed, but that with a2l boldne2s, as always, so now also Christ sha2l be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death. 
For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. 
But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I sha2l ch2ose I wot not. 
For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far be2ter: 
Neverthele2s to abide in the flesh is more n2edful for you. 
And having this confidence, I know that I sha2l abide and continue with you a2l for your furtherance and joy of faith; 
That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again. 
Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and s2e you, or else be absent, I may hear of your a2fairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; 
And in nothing te2rified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God. 
For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to su2fer for his sake; 
Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me. 
If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fe2lowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, 
Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one a2cord, of one mind. 
Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowline2s of mind let each est2em other be2ter than themselves. 
L2ok not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. 
Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 
Who, being in the form of God, thought it not ro2bery to be equal with God: 
But made himself of no reputation, and t2ok upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likene2s of men: 
And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cro2s. 
Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: 
That at the name of Jesus every kn2e should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; 
And that every tongue should confe2s that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. 
Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. 
For it is God which worketh in you both to wi2l and to do of his g2od pleasure. 
Do a2l things without murmurings and disputings: 
That ye may be blamele2s and harmle2s, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a cr2oked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; 
Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain. 
Yea, and if I be o2fered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you a2l. 
For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me. 
But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of g2od comfort, when I know your state. 
For I have no man likeminded, who wi2l natura2ly care for your state. 
For a2l s2ek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's. 
But ye know the pr2of of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel. 
Him therefore I hope to send presently, so s2on as I sha2l s2e how it wi2l go with me. 
But I trust in the Lord that I also myself sha2l come shortly. 
Yet I su2posed it nece2sary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fe2lowsoldier, but your me2senger, and he that ministered to my wants. 
For he longed after you a2l, and was fu2l of heavine2s, because that ye had heard that he had b2en sick. 
For ind2ed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have so2row upon so2row. 
I sent him therefore the more carefu2ly, that, when ye s2e him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the le2s so2rowful. 
Receive him therefore in the Lord with a2l gladne2s; and hold such in reputation: 
Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to su2ply your lack of service toward me. 
Fina2ly, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me ind2ed is not grievous, but for you it is safe. 
Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision. 
For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. 
Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more: 
Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharis2e; 
Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousne2s which is in the law, blamele2s. 
But what things were gain to me, those I counted lo2s for Christ. 
Yea doubtle2s, and I count a2l things but lo2s for the exce2lency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have su2fered the lo2s of a2l things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, 
And be found in him, not having mine own righteousne2s, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousne2s which is of God by faith: 
That I may know him, and the power of his resu2rection, and the fe2lowship of his su2ferings, being made conformable unto his death; 
If by any means I might a2tain unto the resu2rection of the dead. 
Not as though I had already a2tained, either were already perfect: but I fo2low after, if that I may a2prehend that for which also I am a2prehended of Christ Jesus. 
Brethren, I count not myself to have a2prehended: but this one thing I do, forge2ting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, 
I pre2s toward the mark for the prize of the high ca2ling of God in Christ Jesus. 
Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God sha2l reveal even this unto you. 
Neverthele2s, whereto we have already a2tained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing. 
Brethren, be fo2lowers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample. 
(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now te2l you even w2eping, that they are the enemies of the cro2s of Christ: 
Whose end is destruction, whose God is their be2ly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.) 
For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we l2ok for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: 
Who sha2l change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, a2cording to the working whereby he is able even to subdue a2l things unto himself. 
Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved. 
I bes2ech Euodias, and bes2ech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord. 
And I intreat th2e also, true yokefe2low, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fe2lowlabourers, whose names are in the b2ok of life. 
Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice. 
Let your moderation be known unto a2l men. The Lord is at hand. 
Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and su2plication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. 
And the peace of God, which pa2seth a2l understanding, sha2l k2ep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. 
Fina2ly, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of g2od report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. 
Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and s2en in me, do: and the God of peace sha2l be with you. 
But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked o2portunity. 
Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. 
I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in a2l things I am instructed both to be fu2l and to be hungry, both to abound and to su2fer n2ed. 
I can do a2l things through Christ which strengtheneth me. 
Notwithstanding ye have we2l done, that ye did co2municate with my a2fliction. 
Now ye Phili2pians know also, that in the begi2ning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church co2municated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. 
For even in The2salonica ye sent once and again unto my nece2sity. 
Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your a2count. 
But I have a2l, and abound: I am fu2l, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sw2et sme2l, a sacrifice a2ceptable, we2lpleasing to God. 
But my God sha2l su2ply a2l your n2ed a2cording to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. 
Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me gr2et you. 
A2l the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you a2l. Amen. 
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the wi2l of God, and Timotheus our brother, 
To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colo2se: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you, 
Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to a2l the saints, 
For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel; 
Which is come unto you, as it is in a2l the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth: 
As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fe2lowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ; 
Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit. 
For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be fi2led with the knowledge of his wi2l in a2l wisdom and spiritual understanding; 
That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto a2l pleasing, being fruitful in every g2od work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; 
Strengthened with a2l might, a2cording to his glorious power, unto a2l patience and longsu2fering with joyfulne2s; 
Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us m2et to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: 
Who hath delivered us from the power of darkne2s, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: 
In whom we have redemption through his bl2od, even the forgivene2s of sins: 
Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: 
For by him were a2l things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: a2l things were created by him, and for him: 
And he is before a2l things, and by him a2l things consist. 
And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the begi2ning, the firstborn from the dead; that in a2l things he might have the pr2eminence. 
For it pleased the Father that in him should a2l fulne2s dwe2l; 
And, having made peace through the bl2od of his cro2s, by him to reconcile a2l things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. 
And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled 
In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight: 
If ye continue in the faith grounded and se2tled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister; 
Who now rejoice in my su2ferings for you, and fi2l up that which is behind of the a2flictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church: 
Whereof I am made a minister, a2cording to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God; 
Even the mystery which hath b2en hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: 
To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory: 
Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in a2l wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: 
Whereunto I also labour, striving a2cording to his working, which worketh in me mightily. 
For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not s2en my face in the flesh; 
That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto a2l riches of the fu2l a2surance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ; 
In whom are hid a2l the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. 
And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words. 
For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastne2s of your faith in Christ. 
As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: 
R2oted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have b2en taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. 
Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. 
For in him dwe2leth a2l the fulne2s of the Godhead bodily. 
And ye are complete in him, which is the head of a2l principality and power: 
In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in pu2ting o2f the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ: 
Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. 
And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you a2l trespa2ses; 
Blo2ting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and t2ok it out of the way, nailing it to his cro2s; 
And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it. 
Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new m2on, or of the sa2bath days: 
Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ. 
Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshi2ping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not s2en, vainly pu2fed up by his fleshly mind, 
And not holding the Head, from which a2l the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God. 
Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances, 
(Touch not; taste not; handle not; 
Which a2l are to perish with the using;) after the co2mandments and doctrines of men? 
Which things have ind2ed a shew of wisdom in wi2l worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh. 
If ye then be risen with Christ, s2ek those things which are above, where Christ si2teth on the right hand of God. 
Set your a2fection on things above, not on things on the earth. 
For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. 
When Christ, who is our life, sha2l a2pear, then sha2l ye also a2pear with him in glory. 
Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, unclea2ne2s, inordinate a2fection, evil concupiscence, and covetousne2s, which is idolatry: 
For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: 
In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. 
But now ye also put o2f a2l these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy co2munication out of your mouth. 
Lie not one to another, s2eing that ye have put o2f the old man with his d2eds; 
And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: 
Where there is neither Gr2ek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor fr2e: but Christ is a2l, and in a2l. 
Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindne2s, humblene2s of mind, m2ekne2s, longsu2fering; 
Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a qua2rel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. 
And above a2l these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectne2s. 
And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are ca2led in one body; and be ye thankful. 
Let the word of Christ dwe2l in you richly in a2l wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. 
And whatsoever ye do in word or d2ed, do a2l in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him. 
Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. 
Husbands, love your wives, and be not bi2ter against them. 
Children, obey your parents in a2l things: for this is we2l pleasing unto the Lord. 
Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged. 
Servants, obey in a2l things your masters a2cording to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singlene2s of heart, fearing God; 
And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; 
Knowing that of the Lord ye sha2l receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ. 
But he that doeth wrong sha2l receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons. 
Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven. 
Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; 
Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a d2or of u2terance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds: 
That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. 
Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, red2eming the time. 
Let your sp2ech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man. 
A2l my state sha2l Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fe2lowservant in the Lord: 
Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts; 
With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They sha2l make known unto you a2l things which are done here. 
Aristarchus my fe2lowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received co2mandments: if he come unto you, receive him;) 
And Jesus, which is ca2led Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fe2lo2workers unto the kingdom of God, which have b2en a comfort unto me. 
Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in a2l the wi2l of God. 
For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis. 
Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, gr2et you. 
Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house. 
And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea. 
And say to Archi2pus, Take h2ed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it. 
The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen. 
Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the The2salonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
We give thanks to God always for you a2l, making mention of you in our prayers; 
Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father; 
Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God. 
For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much a2surance; as ye know what ma2ner of men we were among you for your sake. 
And ye became fo2lowers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much a2fliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost. 
So that ye were ensamples to a2l that believe in Macedonia and Achaia. 
For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we n2ed not to speak any thing. 
For they themselves shew of us what ma2ner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God; 
And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come. 
For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain: 
But even after that we had su2fered before, and were shamefu2ly entreated, as ye know, at Phili2pi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention. 
For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of unclea2ne2s, nor in guile: 
But as we were a2lowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts. 
For neither at any time used we fla2tering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousne2s; God is witne2s: 
Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have b2en burdensome, as the apostles of Christ. 
But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children: 
So being a2fectionately desirous of you, we were wi2ling to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us. 
For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God. 
Ye are witne2ses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe: 
As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children, 
That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath ca2led you unto his kingdom and glory. 
For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which e2fectua2ly worketh also in you that believe. 
For ye, brethren, became fo2lowers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have su2fered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews: 
Who both ki2led the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to a2l men: 
Forbi2ding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fi2l up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the u2termost. 
But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to s2e your face with great desire. 
Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us. 
For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? 
For ye are our glory and joy. 
Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it g2od to be left at Athens alone; 
And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fe2lowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith: 
That no man should be moved by these a2flictions: for yourselves know that we are a2pointed thereunto. 
For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should su2fer tribulation; even as it came to pa2s, and ye know. 
For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain. 
But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us g2od tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have g2od remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to s2e us, as we also to s2e you: 
Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in a2l our a2fliction and distre2s by your faith: 
For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord. 
For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for a2l the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God; 
Night and day praying exc2edingly that we might s2e your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith? 
Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you. 
And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward a2l men, even as we do toward you: 
To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holine2s before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with a2l his saints. 
Furthermore then we bes2ech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more. 
For ye know what co2mandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus. 
For this is the wi2l of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication: 
That every one of you should know how to po2se2s his ve2sel in sanctification and honour; 
Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God: 
That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any ma2ter: because that the Lord is the avenger of a2l such, as we also have forewarned you and testified. 
For God hath not ca2led us unto unclea2ne2s, but unto holine2s. 
He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit. 
But as touching brotherly love ye n2ed not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another. 
And ind2ed ye do it toward a2l the brethren which are in a2l Macedonia: but we bes2ech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more; 
And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own busine2s, and to work with your own hands, as we co2manded you; 
That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing. 
But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asl2ep, that ye so2row not, even as others which have no hope. 
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sl2ep in Jesus wi2l God bring with him. 
For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord sha2l not prevent them which are asl2ep. 
For the Lord himself sha2l descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ sha2l rise first: 
Then we which are alive and remain sha2l be caught up together with them in the clouds, to m2et the Lord in the air: and so sha2l we ever be with the Lord. 
Wherefore comfort one another with these words. 
But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no n2ed that I write unto you. 
For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. 
For when they sha2l say, Peace and safety; then su2den destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they sha2l not escape. 
But ye, brethren, are not in darkne2s, that that day should overtake you as a thief. 
Ye are a2l the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkne2s. 
Therefore let us not sl2ep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober. 
For they that sl2ep sl2ep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. 
But let us, who are of the day, be sober, pu2ting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. 
For God hath not a2pointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, 
Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sl2ep, we should live together with him. 
Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do. 
And we bes2ech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; 
And to est2em them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves. 
Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the f2ebleminded, su2port the weak, be patient toward a2l men. 
S2e that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever fo2low that which is g2od, both among yourselves, and to a2l men. 
Rejoice evermore. 
Pray without ceasing. 
In every thing give thanks: for this is the wi2l of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. 
Quench not the Spirit. 
Despise not prophesyings. 
Prove a2l things; hold fast that which is g2od. 
Abstain from a2l a2pearance of evil. 
And the very God of peace sanctify you who2ly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blamele2s unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Faithful is he that ca2leth you, who also wi2l do it. 
Brethren, pray for us. 
Gr2et a2l the brethren with an holy ki2s. 
I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto a2l the holy brethren. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen. 
Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the The2salonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: 
Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is m2et, because that your faith groweth exc2edingly, and the charity of every one of you a2l toward each other aboundeth; 
So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in a2l your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure: 
Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also su2fer: 
S2eing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you; 
And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus sha2l be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, 
In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: 
Who sha2l be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; 
When he sha2l come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in a2l them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day. 
Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this ca2ling, and fulfil a2l the g2od pleasure of his g2odne2s, and the work of faith with power: 
That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, a2cording to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Now we bes2ech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, 
That ye be not s2on shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by le2ter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand. 
Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day sha2l not come, except there come a fa2ling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; 
Who o2poseth and exalteth himself above a2l that is ca2led God, or that is worshi2ped; so that he as God si2teth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. 
Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things? 
And now ye know what wit2holdeth that he might be revealed in his time. 
For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now le2teth wi2l let, until he be taken out of the way. 
And then sha2l that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord sha2l consume with the spirit of his mouth, and sha2l destroy with the brightne2s of his coming: 
Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with a2l power and signs and lying wonders, 
And with a2l deceivablene2s of unrighteousne2s in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 
And for this cause God sha2l send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: 
That they a2l might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousne2s. 
But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the begi2ning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: 
Whereunto he ca2led you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have b2en taught, whether by word, or our epistle. 
Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and g2od hope through grace, 
Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every g2od word and work. 
Fina2ly, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have fr2e course, and be glorified, even as it is with you: 
And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for a2l men have not faith. 
But the Lord is faithful, who sha2l stablish you, and k2ep you from evil. 
And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and wi2l do the things which we co2mand you. 
And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ. 
Now we co2mand you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us. 
For yourselves know how ye ought to fo2low us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you; 
Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you: 
Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to fo2low us. 
For even when we were with you, this we co2manded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat. 
For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at a2l, but are busybodies. 
Now them that are such we co2mand and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietne2s they work, and eat their own bread. 
But ye, brethren, be not weary in we2l doing. 
And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed. 
Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. 
Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by a2l means. The Lord be with you a2l. 
The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you a2l. Amen. 
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the co2mandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope; 
Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord. 
As I besought th2e to abide sti2l at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine, 
Neither give h2ed to fables and endle2s genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do. 
Now the end of the co2mandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a g2od conscience, and of faith unfeigned: 
From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling; 
Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they a2firm. 
But we know that the law is g2od, if a man use it lawfu2ly; 
Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawle2s and disobedient, for the ungodly and for si2ners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, 
For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine; 
A2cording to the glorious gospel of the ble2sed God, which was co2mi2ted to my trust. 
And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, pu2ting me into the ministry; 
Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. 
And the grace of our Lord was exc2eding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
This is a faithful saying, and worthy of a2l a2ceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save si2ners; of whom I am chief. 
Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth a2l longsu2fering, for a pa2tern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. 
Now unto the King eternal, i2mortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
This charge I co2mit unto th2e, son Timothy, a2cording to the prophecies which went before on th2e, that thou by them mightest war a g2od warfare; 
Holding faith, and a g2od conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck: 
Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme. 
I exhort therefore, that, first of a2l, su2plications, prayers, interce2sions, and giving of thanks, be made for a2l men; 
For kings, and for a2l that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in a2l godline2s and honesty. 
For this is g2od and a2ceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; 
Who wi2l have a2l men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. 
For there is one God, and one mediator betw2en God and men, the man Christ Jesus; 
Who gave himself a ransom for a2l, to be testified in due time. 
Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. 
I wi2l therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. 
In like ma2ner also, that women adorn themselves in modest a2parel, with shamefacedne2s and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly a2ray; 
But (which becometh women profe2sing godline2s) with g2od works. 
Let the woman learn in silence with a2l subjection. 
But I su2fer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. 
For Adam was first formed, then Eve. 
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgre2sion. 
Notwithstanding she sha2l be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holine2s with sobriety. 
This is a true saying, if a man desire the o2fice of a bishop, he desireth a g2od work. 
A bishop then must be blamele2s, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of g2od behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach; 
Not given to wine, no striker, not gr2edy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous; 
One that ruleth we2l his own house, having his children in subjection with a2l gravity; 
(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how sha2l he take care of the church of God?) 
Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fa2l into the condemnation of the devil. 
Moreover he must have a g2od report of them which are without; lest he fa2l into reproach and the snare of the devil. 
Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not gr2edy of filthy lucre; 
Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. 
And let these also first be proved; then let them use the o2fice of a deacon, being found blamele2s. 
Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in a2l things. 
Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses we2l. 
For they that have used the o2fice of a deacon we2l purchase to themselves a g2od degr2e, and great boldne2s in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
These things write I unto th2e, hoping to come unto th2e shortly: 
But if I ta2ry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pi2lar and ground of the truth. 
And without controversy great is the mystery of godline2s: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, s2en of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory. 
Now the Spirit speaketh expre2sly, that in the la2ter times some sha2l depart from the faith, giving h2ed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; 
Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; 
Forbi2ding to ma2ry, and co2manding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. 
For every creature of God is g2od, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: 
For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. 
If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a g2od minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of g2od doctrine, whereunto thou hast a2tained. 
But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godline2s. 
For bodily exercise profiteth li2tle: but godline2s is profitable unto a2l things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. 
This is a faithful saying and worthy of a2l a2ceptation. 
For therefore we both labour and su2fer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of a2l men, specia2ly of those that believe. 
These things co2mand and teach. 
Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. 
Ti2l I come, give a2tendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. 
Neglect not the gift that is in th2e, which was given th2e by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. 
Meditate upon these things; give thyself who2ly to them; that thy profiting may a2pear to a2l. 
Take h2ed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear th2e. 
Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren; 
The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with a2l purity. 
Honour widows that are widows ind2ed. 
But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is g2od and a2ceptable before God. 
Now she that is a widow ind2ed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in su2plications and prayers night and day. 
But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth. 
And these things give in charge, that they may be blamele2s. 
But if any provide not for his own, and specia2ly for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel. 
Let not a widow be taken into the number under thr2escore years old, having b2en the wife of one man. 
We2l reported of for g2od works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' f2et, if she have relieved the a2flicted, if she have diligently fo2lowed every g2od work. 
But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they wi2l ma2ry; 
Having damnation, because they have cast o2f their first faith. 
And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but ta2tlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not. 
I wi2l therefore that the younger women ma2ry, bear children, guide the house, give none o2casion to the adversary to speak reproachfu2ly. 
For some are already turned aside after Satan. 
If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows ind2ed. 
Let the elders that rule we2l be counted worthy of double honour, especia2ly they who labour in the word and doctrine. 
For the scripture saith, thou shalt not mu2zle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward. 
Against an elder receive not an a2cusation, but before two or thr2e witne2ses. 
Them that sin rebuke before a2l, that others also may fear. 
I charge th2e before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without prefe2ring one before another, doing nothing by partiality. 
Lay hands su2denly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: k2ep thyself pure. 
Drink no longer water, but use a li2tle wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities. 
Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they fo2low after. 
Likewise also the g2od works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise ca2not be hid. 
Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of a2l honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed. 
And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort. 
If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is a2cording to godline2s; 
He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, 
Perverse disputings of men of co2rupt minds, and destitute of the truth, su2posing that gain is godline2s: from such withdraw thyself. 
But godline2s with contentment is great gain. 
For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can ca2ry nothing out. 
And having f2od and raiment let us be therewith content. 
But they that wi2l be rich fa2l into temptation and a snare, and into many f2olish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. 
For the love of money is the r2ot of a2l evil: which while some coveted after, they have e2red from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many so2rows. 
But thou, O man of God, fl2e these things; and fo2low after righteousne2s, godline2s, faith, love, patience, m2ekne2s. 
Fight the g2od fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also ca2led, and hast profe2sed a g2od profe2sion before many witne2ses. 
I give th2e charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth a2l things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witne2sed a g2od confe2sion; 
That thou k2ep this co2mandment without spot, unrebukable, until the a2pearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: 
Which in his times he sha2l shew, who is the ble2sed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; 
Who only hath i2mortality, dwe2ling in the light which no man can a2proach unto; whom no man hath s2en, nor can s2e: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen. 
Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly a2l things to enjoy; 
That they do g2od, that they be rich in g2od works, ready to distribute, wi2ling to co2municate; 
Laying up in store for themselves a g2od foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life. 
O Timothy, k2ep that which is co2mi2ted to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain ba2blings, and o2positions of science falsely so ca2led: 
Which some profe2sing have e2red concerning the faith. Grace be with th2e. Amen. 
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the wi2l of God, a2cording to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus, 
To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 
I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of th2e in my prayers night and day; 
Greatly desiring to s2e th2e, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be fi2led with joy; 
When I ca2l to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in th2e, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in th2e also. 
Wherefore I put th2e in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in th2e by the pu2ting on of my hands. 
For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. 
Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the a2flictions of the gospel a2cording to the power of God; 
Who hath saved us, and ca2led us with an holy ca2ling, not a2cording to our works, but a2cording to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began, 
But is now made manifest by the a2pearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and i2mortality to light through the gospel: 
Whereunto I am a2pointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. 
For the which cause I also su2fer these things: neverthele2s I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to k2ep that which I have co2mi2ted unto him against that day. 
Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
That g2od thing which was co2mi2ted unto th2e k2ep by the Holy Ghost which dwe2leth in us. 
This thou knowest, that a2l they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phyge2lus and Hermogenes. 
The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: 
But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me. 
The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very we2l. 
Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 
And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witne2ses, the same co2mit thou to faithful men, who sha2l be able to teach others also. 
Thou therefore endure hardne2s, as a g2od soldier of Jesus Christ. 
No man that wa2reth entangleth himself with the a2fairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. 
And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfu2ly. 
The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits. 
Consider what I say; and the Lord give th2e understanding in a2l things. 
Remember that Jesus Christ of the s2ed of David was raised from the dead a2cording to my gospel: 
Wherein I su2fer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound. 
Therefore I endure a2l things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. 
It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we sha2l also live with him: 
If we su2fer, we sha2l also reign with him: if we deny him, he also wi2l deny us: 
If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he ca2not deny himself. 
Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers. 
Study to shew thyself a2proved unto God, a workman that n2edeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 
But shun profane and vain ba2blings: for they wi2l increase unto more ungodline2s. 
And their word wi2l eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; 
Who concerning the truth have e2red, saying that the resu2rection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. 
Neverthele2s the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. 
But in a great house there are not only ve2sels of gold and of silver, but also of w2od and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. 
If a man therefore purge himself from these, he sha2l be a ve2sel unto honour, sanctified, and m2et for the master's use, and prepared unto every g2od work. 
Fl2e also youthful lusts: but fo2low righteousne2s, faith, charity, peace, with them that ca2l on the Lord out of a pure heart. 
But f2olish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes. 
And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto a2l men, apt to teach, patient, 
In m2ekne2s instructing those that o2pose themselves; if God peradventure wi2l give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; 
And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his wi2l. 
This know also, that in the last days perilous times sha2l come. 
For men sha2l be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 
Without natural a2fection, trucebreakers, false a2cusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are g2od, 
Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; 
Having a form of godline2s, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. 
For of this sort are they which cr2ep into houses, and lead captive si2ly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, 
Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 
Now as Ja2nes and Jambres withst2od Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of co2rupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. 
But they sha2l proc2ed no further: for their fo2ly sha2l be manifest unto a2l men, as their's also was. 
But thou hast fu2ly known my doctrine, ma2ner of life, purpose, faith, longsu2fering, charity, patience, 
Persecutions, a2flictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them a2l the Lord delivered me. 
Yea, and a2l that wi2l live godly in Christ Jesus sha2l su2fer persecution. 
But evil men and seducers sha2l wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. 
But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast b2en a2sured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; 
And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make th2e wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
A2l scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for repr2of, for co2rection, for instruction in righteousne2s: 
That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto a2l g2od works. 
I charge th2e therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who sha2l judge the quick and the dead at his a2pearing and his kingdom; 
Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with a2l long su2fering and doctrine. 
For the time wi2l come when they wi2l not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts sha2l they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; 
And they sha2l turn away their ears from the truth, and sha2l be turned unto fables. 
But watch thou in a2l things, endure a2flictions, do the work of an evangelist, make fu2l pr2of of thy ministry. 
For I am now ready to be o2fered, and the time of my departure is at hand. 
I have fought a g2od fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: 
Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousne2s, which the Lord, the righteous judge, sha2l give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto a2l them also that love his a2pearing. 
Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me: 
For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto The2salonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia. 
Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with th2e: for he is profitable to me for the ministry. 
And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus. 
The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with th2e, and the b2oks, but especia2ly the parchments. 
Alexander the co2persmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him a2cording to his works: 
Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withst2od our words. 
At my first answer no man st2od with me, but a2l men fors2ok me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge. 
Notwithstanding the Lord st2od with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fu2ly known, and that a2l the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. 
And the Lord sha2l deliver me from every evil work, and wi2l preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. 
Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick. 
Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus gr2eteth th2e, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and a2l the brethren. 
The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen. 
Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, a2cording to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godline2s; 
In hope of eternal life, which God, that ca2not lie, promised before the world began; 
But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is co2mi2ted unto me a2cording to the co2mandment of God our Saviour; 
To Titus, mine own son after the co2mon faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour. 
For this cause left I th2e in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had a2pointed th2e: 
If any be blamele2s, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not a2cused of riot or unruly. 
For a bishop must be blamele2s, as the steward of God; not selfwi2led, not s2on angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre; 
But a lover of hospitality, a lover of g2od men, sober, just, holy, temperate; 
Holding fast the faithful word as he hath b2en taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers. 
For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specia2ly they of the circumcision: 
Whose mouths must be sto2ped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake. 
One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, the Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow be2lies. 
This witne2s is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; 
Not giving h2ed to Jewish fables, and co2mandments of men, that turn from the truth. 
Unto the pure a2l things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled. 
They profe2s that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every g2od work reprobate. 
But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: 
That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. 
The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holine2s, not false a2cusers, not given to much wine, teachers of g2od things; 
That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, 
To be discr2et, chaste, k2epers at home, g2od, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed. 
Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded. 
In a2l things shewing thyself a pa2tern of g2od works: in doctrine shewing unco2ruptne2s, gravity, sincerity, 
Sound sp2ech, that ca2not be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you. 
Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them we2l in a2l things; not answering again; 
Not purloining, but shewing a2l g2od fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in a2l things. 
For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath a2peared to a2l men, 
Teaching us that, denying ungodline2s and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; 
L2oking for that ble2sed hope, and the glorious a2pearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; 
Who gave himself for us, that he might red2em us from a2l iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of g2od works. 
These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with a2l authority. Let no man despise th2e. 
Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every g2od work, 
To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing a2l m2ekne2s unto a2l men. 
For we ourselves also were sometimes f2olish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. 
But after that the kindne2s and love of God our Saviour toward man a2peared, 
Not by works of righteousne2s which we have done, but a2cording to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; 
Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; 
That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs a2cording to the hope of eternal life. 
This is a faithful saying, and these things I wi2l that thou a2firm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain g2od works. These things are g2od and profitable unto men. 
But avoid f2olish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. 
A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject; 
Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and si2neth, being condemned of himself. 
When I sha2l send Artemas unto th2e, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter. 
Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apo2los on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them. 
And let our's also learn to maintain g2od works for nece2sary uses, that they be not unfruitful. 
A2l that are with me salute th2e. Gr2et them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you a2l. Amen. 
Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fe2lowlabourer, 
And to our beloved A2phia, and Archi2pus our fe2lowsoldier, and to the church in thy house: 
Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
I thank my God, making mention of th2e always in my prayers, 
Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward a2l saints; 
That the co2munication of thy faith may become e2fectual by the acknowledging of every g2od thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. 
For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by th2e, brother. 
Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin th2e that which is convenient, 
Yet for love's sake I rather bes2ech th2e, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. 
I bes2ech th2e for my son Onesimus, whom I have bego2ten in my bonds: 
Which in time past was to th2e unprofitable, but now profitable to th2e and to me: 
Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels: 
Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: 
But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of nece2sity, but wi2lingly. 
For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever; 
Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specia2ly to me, but how much more unto th2e, both in the flesh, and in the Lord? 
If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. 
If he hath wronged th2e, or oweth th2e ought, put that on mine a2count; 
I Paul have wri2ten it with mine own hand, I wi2l repay it: albeit I do not say to th2e how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides. 
Yea, brother, let me have joy of th2e in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord. 
Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto th2e, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say. 
But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I sha2l be given unto you. 
There salute th2e Epaphras, my fe2lowprisoner in Christ Jesus; 
Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fe2lowlabourers. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. 
God, who at sundry times and in divers ma2ners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, 
Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath a2pointed heir of a2l things, by whom also he made the worlds; 
Who being the brightne2s of his glory, and the expre2s image of his person, and upholding a2l things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high: 
Being made so much be2ter than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more exce2lent name than they. 
For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I bego2ten th2e? And again, I wi2l be to him a Father, and he sha2l be to me a Son? 
And again, when he bringeth in the firstbego2ten into the world, he saith, And let a2l the angels of God worship him. 
And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire. 
But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousne2s is the sceptre of thy kingdom. 
Thou hast loved righteousne2s, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed th2e with the oil of gladne2s above thy fe2lows. 
And, Thou, Lord, in the begi2ning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands: 
They sha2l perish; but thou remainest; and they a2l sha2l wax old as doth a garment; 
And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they sha2l be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years sha2l not fail. 
But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy f2otst2ol? 
Are they not a2l ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who sha2l be heirs of salvation? 
Therefore we ought to give the more earnest h2ed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. 
For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgre2sion and disobedience received a just recompence of reward; 
How sha2l we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; 
God also bearing them witne2s, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, a2cording to his own wi2l? 
For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak. 
But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him? 
Thou madest him a li2tle lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands: 
Thou hast put a2l things in subjection under his f2et. For in that he put a2l in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we s2e not yet a2l things put under him. 
But we s2e Jesus, who was made a li2tle lower than the angels for the su2fering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. 
For it became him, for whom are a2l things, and by whom are a2l things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through su2ferings. 
For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are a2l of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to ca2l them brethren, 
Saying, I wi2l declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church wi2l I sing praise unto th2e. 
And again, I wi2l put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me. 
Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and bl2od, he also himself likewise t2ok part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; 
And deliver them who through fear of death were a2l their lifetime subject to bondage. 
For verily he t2ok not on him the nature of angels; but he t2ok on him the s2ed of Abraham. 
Wherefore in a2l things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. 
For in that he himself hath su2fered being tempted, he is able to su2cour them that are tempted. 
Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly ca2ling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profe2sion, Christ Jesus; 
Who was faithful to him that a2pointed him, as also Moses was faithful in a2l his house. 
For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house. 
For every house is builded by some man; but he that built a2l things is God. 
And Moses verily was faithful in a2l his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; 
But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. 
Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye wi2l hear his voice, 
Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderne2s: 
When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years. 
Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway e2r in their heart; and they have not known my ways. 
So I sware in my wrath, They sha2l not enter into my rest.) 
Take h2ed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God. 
But exhort one another daily, while it is ca2led To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulne2s of sin. 
For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the begi2ning of our confidence stedfast unto the end; 
While it is said, To day if ye wi2l hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation. 
For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not a2l that came out of Egypt by Moses. 
But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had si2ned, whose carcases fe2l in the wilderne2s? 
And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not? 
So we s2e that they could not enter in because of unbelief. 
Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should s2em to come short of it. 
For unto us was the gospel preached, as we2l as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it. 
For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they sha2l enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. 
For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from a2l his works. 
And in this place again, If they sha2l enter into my rest. 
S2eing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief: 
Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye wi2l hear his voice, harden not your hearts. 
For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day. 
There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. 
For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his. 
Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fa2l after the same example of unbelief. 
For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and ma2row, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. 
Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but a2l things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. 
S2eing then that we have a great high priest, that is pa2sed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profe2sion. 
For we have not an high priest which ca2not be touched with the f2eling of our infirmities; but was in a2l points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. 
Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of n2ed. 
For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may o2fer both gifts and sacrifices for sins: 
Who can have compa2sion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compa2sed with infirmity. 
And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to o2fer for sins. 
And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is ca2led of God, as was Aaron. 
So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I bego2ten th2e. 
As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. 
Who in the days of his flesh, when he had o2fered up prayers and su2plications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; 
Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he su2fered; 
And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto a2l them that obey him; 
Ca2led of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec. 
Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be u2tered, s2eing ye are du2l of hearing. 
For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have n2ed that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have n2ed of milk, and not of strong meat. 
For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousne2s: for he is a babe. 
But strong meat belongeth to them that are of fu2l age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both g2od and evil. 
Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, 
Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resu2rection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. 
And this wi2l we do, if God permit. 
For it is impo2sible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, 
And have tasted the g2od word of God, and the powers of the world to come, 
If they sha2l fa2l away, to renew them again unto repentance; s2eing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame. 
For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs m2et for them by whom it is dre2sed, receiveth ble2sing from God: 
But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned. 
But, beloved, we are persuaded be2ter things of you, and things that a2company salvation, though we thus speak. 
For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister. 
And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the fu2l a2surance of hope unto the end: 
That ye be not slothful, but fo2lowers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. 
For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself, 
Saying, Surely ble2sing I wi2l ble2s th2e, and multiplying I wi2l multiply th2e. 
And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. 
For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of a2l strife. 
Wherein God, wi2ling more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the i2mutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: 
That by two i2mutable things, in which it was impo2sible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us: 
Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil; 
Whither the foreru2ner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. 
For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and ble2sed him; 
To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of a2l; first being by interpretation King of righteousne2s, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace; 
Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither begi2ning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continua2ly. 
Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. 
And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the o2fice of the priesth2od, have a co2mandment to take tithes of the people a2cording to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: 
But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and ble2sed him that had the promises. 
And without a2l contradiction the le2s is ble2sed of the be2ter. 
And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witne2sed that he liveth. 
And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham. 
For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him. 
If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesth2od, (for under it the people received the law,) what further n2ed was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be ca2led after the order of Aaron? 
For the priesth2od being changed, there is made of nece2sity a change also of the law. 
For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave a2tendance at the altar. 
For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesth2od. 
And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest, 
Who is made, not after the law of a carnal co2mandment, but after the power of an endle2s life. 
For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. 
For there is verily a disa2nu2ling of the co2mandment going before for the weakne2s and unprofitablene2s thereof. 
For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a be2ter hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God. 
And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest: 
(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and wi2l not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:) 
By so much was Jesus made a surety of a be2ter testament. 
And they truly were many priests, because they were not su2fered to continue by reason of death: 
But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesth2od. 
Wherefore he is able also to save them to the u2termost that come unto God by him, s2eing he ever liveth to make interce2sion for them. 
For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmle2s, undefiled, separate from si2ners, and made higher than the heavens; 
Who n2edeth not daily, as those high priests, to o2fer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he o2fered up himself. 
For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore. 
Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; 
A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man. 
For every high priest is ordained to o2fer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of nece2sity that this man have somewhat also to o2fer. 
For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, s2eing that there are priests that o2fer gifts a2cording to the law: 
Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, S2e, saith he, that thou make a2l things a2cording to the pa2tern shewed to th2e in the mount. 
But now hath he obtained a more exce2lent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a be2ter covenant, which was established upon be2ter promises. 
For if that first covenant had b2en faultle2s, then should no place have b2en sought for the second. 
For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I wi2l make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah: 
Not a2cording to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I t2ok them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. 
For this is the covenant that I wi2l make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I wi2l put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I wi2l be to them a God, and they sha2l be to me a people: 
And they sha2l not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for a2l sha2l know me, from the least to the greatest. 
For I wi2l be merciful to their unrighteousne2s, and their sins and their iniquities wi2l I remember no more. 
In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away. 
Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary. 
For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is ca2led the sanctuary. 
And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is ca2led the Holiest of a2l; 
Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had ma2na, and Aaron's rod that bu2ded, and the tables of the covenant; 
And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we ca2not now speak particularly. 
Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, a2complishing the service of God. 
But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without bl2od, which he o2fered for himself, and for the e2rors of the people: 
The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of a2l was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing: 
Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were o2fered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience; 
Which st2od only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation. 
But Christ being come an high priest of g2od things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; 
Neither by the bl2od of goats and calves, but by his own bl2od he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. 
For if the bl2od of bu2ls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: 
How much more sha2l the bl2od of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit o2fered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? 
And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgre2sions that were under the first testament, they which are ca2led might receive the promise of eternal inheritance. 
For where a testament is, there must also of nece2sity be the death of the testator. 
For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at a2l while the testator liveth. 
Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without bl2od. 
For when Moses had spoken every precept to a2l the people a2cording to the law, he t2ok the bl2od of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet w2ol, and hy2sop, and sprinkled both the b2ok, and a2l the people, 
Saying, This is the bl2od of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you. 
Moreover he sprinkled with bl2od both the tabernacle, and a2l the ve2sels of the ministry. 
And almost a2l things are by the law purged with bl2od; and without she2ding of bl2od is no remi2sion. 
It was therefore nece2sary that the pa2terns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with be2ter sacrifices than these. 
For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to a2pear in the presence of God for us: 
Nor yet that he should o2fer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with bl2od of others; 
For then must he often have su2fered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he a2peared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. 
And as it is a2pointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: 
So Christ was once o2fered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that l2ok for him sha2l he a2pear the second time without sin unto salvation. 
For the law having a shadow of g2od things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they o2fered year by year continua2ly make the comers thereunto perfect. 
For then would they not have ceased to be o2fered? because that the worshi2pers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins. 
But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year. 
For it is not po2sible that the bl2od of bu2ls and of goats should take away sins. 
Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and o2fering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me: 
In burnt o2ferings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. 
Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the b2ok it is wri2ten of me,) to do thy wi2l, O God. 
Above when he said, Sacrifice and o2fering and burnt o2ferings and o2fering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are o2fered by the law; 
Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy wi2l, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second. 
By the which wi2l we are sanctified through the o2fering of the body of Jesus Christ once for a2l. 
And every priest standeth daily ministering and o2fering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: 
But this man, after he had o2fered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; 
From henceforth expecting ti2l his enemies be made his f2otst2ol. 
For by one o2fering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. 
Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witne2s to us: for after that he had said before, 
This is the covenant that I wi2l make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I wi2l put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds wi2l I write them; 
And their sins and iniquities wi2l I remember no more. 
Now where remi2sion of these is, there is no more o2fering for sin. 
Having therefore, brethren, boldne2s to enter into the holiest by the bl2od of Jesus, 
By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; 
And having an high priest over the house of God; 
Let us draw near with a true heart in fu2l a2surance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water. 
Let us hold fast the profe2sion of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;) 
And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to g2od works: 
Not forsaking the a2sembling of ourselves together, as the ma2ner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye s2e the day a2proaching. 
For if we sin wilfu2ly after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, 
But a certain fearful l2oking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which sha2l devour the adversaries. 
He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or thr2e witne2ses: 
Of how much sorer punishment, su2pose ye, sha2l he be thought worthy, who hath tro2den under f2ot the Son of God, and hath counted the bl2od of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? 
For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I wi2l recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord sha2l judge his people. 
It is a fearful thing to fa2l into the hands of the living God. 
But ca2l to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were i2luminated, ye endured a great fight of a2flictions; 
Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and a2flictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. 
For ye had compa2sion of me in my bonds, and t2ok joyfu2ly the spoiling of your g2ods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a be2ter and an enduring substance. 
Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. 
For ye have n2ed of patience, that, after ye have done the wi2l of God, ye might receive the promise. 
For yet a li2tle while, and he that sha2l come wi2l come, and wi2l not ta2ry. 
Now the just sha2l live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul sha2l have no pleasure in him. 
But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul. 
Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not s2en. 
For by it the elders obtained a g2od report. 
Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are s2en were not made of things which do a2pear. 
By faith Abel o2fered unto God a more exce2lent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witne2s that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh. 
By faith Enoch was translated that he should not s2e death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. 
But without faith it is impo2sible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently s2ek him. 
By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not s2en as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousne2s which is by faith. 
By faith Abraham, when he was ca2led to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. 
By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwe2ling in tabernacles with Is2ac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: 
For he l2oked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. 
Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive s2ed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised. 
Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as g2od as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore i2numerable. 
These a2l died in faith, not having received the promises, but having s2en them afar o2f, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confe2sed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. 
For they that say such things declare plainly that they s2ek a country. 
And truly, if they had b2en mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had o2portunity to have returned. 
But now they desire a be2ter country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be ca2led their God: for he hath prepared for them a city. 
By faith Abraham, when he was tried, o2fered up Is2ac: and he that had received the promises o2fered up his only bego2ten son, 
Of whom it was said, That in Is2ac sha2l thy s2ed be ca2led: 
A2counting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure. 
By faith Is2ac ble2sed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. 
By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, ble2sed both the sons of Joseph; and worshi2ped, leaning upon the top of his sta2f. 
By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave co2mandment concerning his bones. 
By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid thr2e months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's co2mandment. 
By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be ca2led the son of Pharaoh's daughter; 
Ch2osing rather to su2fer a2fliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; 
Est2eming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward. 
By faith he fors2ok Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as s2eing him who is invisible. 
Through faith he kept the pa2sover, and the sprinkling of bl2od, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them. 
By faith they pa2sed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians a2saying to do were drowned. 
By faith the wa2ls of Jericho fe2l down, after they were compa2sed about seven days. 
By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace. 
And what sha2l I more say? for the time would fail me to te2l of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets: 
Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousne2s, obtained promises, sto2ped the mouths of lions. 
Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakne2s were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. 
Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not a2cepting deliverance; that they might obtain a be2ter resu2rection: 
And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: 
They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sh2epskins and goatskins; being destitute, a2flicted, tormented; 
(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. 
And these a2l, having obtained a g2od report through faith, received not the promise: 
God having provided some be2ter thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect. 
Wherefore s2eing we also are compa2sed about with so great a cloud of witne2ses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, 
L2oking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cro2s, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. 
For consider him that endured such contradiction of si2ners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. 
Ye have not yet resisted unto bl2od, striving against sin. 
And ye have forgo2ten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him: 
For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. 
If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? 
But if ye be without chastisement, whereof a2l are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons. 
Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which co2rected us, and we gave them reverence: sha2l we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live? 
For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holine2s. 
Now no chastening for the present s2emeth to be joyous, but grievous: neverthele2s afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousne2s unto them which are exercised thereby. 
Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the f2eble kn2es; 
And make straight paths for your f2et, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed. 
Fo2low peace with a2l men, and holine2s, without which no man sha2l s2e the Lord: 
L2oking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any r2ot of bi2terne2s springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled; 
Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright. 
For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the ble2sing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefu2ly with tears. 
For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackne2s, and darkne2s, and tempest, 
And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more: 
(For they could not endure that which was co2manded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it sha2l be stoned, or thrust through with a dart: 
And so te2rible was the sight, that Moses said, I exc2edingly fear and quake:) 
But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an i2numerable company of angels, 
To the general a2sembly and church of the firstborn, which are wri2ten in heaven, and to God the Judge of a2l, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, 
And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the bl2od of sprinkling, that speaketh be2ter things that that of Abel. 
S2e that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more sha2l not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven: 
Whose voice then sh2ok the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven. 
And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which ca2not be shaken may remain. 
Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which ca2not be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God a2ceptably with reverence and godly fear: 
For our God is a consuming fire. 
Let brotherly love continue. 
Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. 
Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which su2fer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body. 
Ma2riage is honourable in a2l, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God wi2l judge. 
Let your conversation be without covetousne2s; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I wi2l never leave th2e, nor forsake th2e. 
So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I wi2l not fear what man sha2l do unto me. 
Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith fo2low, considering the end of their conversation. 
Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever. 
Be not ca2ried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a g2od thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have b2en o2cupied therein. 
We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle. 
For the bodies of those beasts, whose bl2od is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp. 
Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own bl2od, su2fered without the gate. 
Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. 
For here have we no continuing city, but we s2ek one to come. 
By him therefore let us o2fer the sacrifice of praise to God continua2ly, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name. 
But to do g2od and to co2municate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is we2l pleased. 
Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give a2count, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you. 
Pray for us: for we trust we have a g2od conscience, in a2l things wi2ling to live honestly. 
But I bes2ech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the s2oner. 
Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sh2ep, through the bl2od of the everlasting covenant, 
Make you perfect in every g2od work to do his wi2l, working in you that which is we2lpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 
And I bes2ech you, brethren, su2fer the word of exhortation: for I have wri2ten a le2ter unto you in few words. 
Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I wi2l s2e you. 
Salute a2l them that have the rule over you, and a2l the saints. They of Italy salute you. 
Grace be with you a2l. Amen. 
James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are sca2tered abroad, gr2eting. 
My brethren, count it a2l joy when ye fa2l into divers temptations; 
Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. 
But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. 
If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to a2l men libera2ly, and upbraideth not; and it sha2l be given him. 
But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and to2sed. 
For let not that man think that he sha2l receive any thing of the Lord. 
A double minded man is unstable in a2l his ways. 
Let the brother of low degr2e rejoice in that he is exalted: 
But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the gra2s he sha2l pa2s away. 
For the sun is no s2oner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the gra2s, and the flower thereof fa2leth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also sha2l the rich man fade away in his ways. 
Ble2sed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he sha2l receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. 
Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God ca2not be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: 
But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. 
Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death. 
Do not e2r, my beloved brethren. 
Every g2od gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variablene2s, neither shadow of turning. 
Of his own wi2l begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. 
Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: 
For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousne2s of God. 
Wherefore lay apart a2l filthine2s and superfluity of naughtine2s, and receive with m2ekne2s the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls. 
But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. 
For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a gla2s: 
For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forge2teth what ma2ner of man he was. 
But whoso l2oketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man sha2l be ble2sed in his d2ed. 
If any man among you s2em to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain. 
Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherle2s and widows in their a2fliction, and to k2ep himself unspo2ted from the world. 
My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons. 
For if there come unto your a2sembly a man with a gold ring, in g2odly a2parel, and there come in also a p2or man in vile raiment; 
And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a g2od place; and say to the p2or, Stand thou there, or sit here under my f2otst2ol: 
Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts? 
Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the p2or of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? 
But ye have despised the p2or. Do not rich men o2pre2s you, and draw you before the judgment seats? 
Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are ca2led? 
If ye fulfil the royal law a2cording to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do we2l: 
But if ye have respect to persons, ye co2mit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgre2sors. 
For whosoever sha2l k2ep the whole law, and yet o2fend in one point, he is guilty of a2l. 
For he that said, Do not co2mit adultery, said also, Do not ki2l. Now if thou co2mit no adultery, yet if thou ki2l, thou art become a transgre2sor of the law. 
So speak ye, and so do, as they that sha2l be judged by the law of liberty. 
For he sha2l have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment. 
What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? 
If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily f2od, 
And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and fi2led; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are n2edful to the body; what doth it profit? 
Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. 
Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I wi2l shew th2e my faith by my works. 
Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest we2l: the devils also believe, and tremble. 
But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? 
Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had o2fered Is2ac his son upon the altar? 
S2est thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? 
And the scripture was fulfi2led which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousne2s: and he was ca2led the Friend of God. 
Ye s2e then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only. 
Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the me2sengers, and had sent them out another way? 
For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. 
My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we sha2l receive the greater condemnation. 
For in many things we o2fend a2l. If any man o2fend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body. 
Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body. 
Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very sma2l helm, whithersoever the governor listeth. 
Even so the tongue is a li2tle member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a ma2ter a li2tle fire kindleth! 
And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and se2teth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of he2l. 
For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath b2en tamed of mankind: 
But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, fu2l of deadly poison. 
Therewith ble2s we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God. 
Out of the same mouth proc2edeth ble2sing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. 
Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sw2et water and bi2ter? 
Can the fig tr2e, my brethren, bear olive be2ries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh. 
Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a g2od conversation his works with m2ekne2s of wisdom. 
But if ye have bi2ter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. 
This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. 
For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work. 
But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, fu2l of mercy and g2od fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. 
And the fruit of righteousne2s is sown in peace of them that make peace. 
From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members? 
Ye lust, and have not: ye ki2l, and desire to have, and ca2not obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not. 
Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask ami2s, that ye may consume it upon your lusts. 
Ye adulterers and adultere2ses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore wi2l be a friend of the world is the enemy of God. 
Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwe2leth in us lusteth to envy? 
But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. 
Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he wi2l fl2e from you. 
Draw nigh to God, and he wi2l draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye si2ners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded. 
Be a2flicted, and mourn, and w2ep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heavine2s. 
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he sha2l lift you up. 
Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. 
There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another? 
Go to now, ye that say, To day or to mo2row we wi2l go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and se2l, and get gain: 
Whereas ye know not what sha2l be on the mo2row. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that a2peareth for a li2tle time, and then vanisheth away. 
For that ye ought to say, If the Lord wi2l, we sha2l live, and do this, or that. 
But now ye rejoice in your boastings: a2l such rejoicing is evil. 
Therefore to him that knoweth to do g2od, and doeth it not, to him it is sin. 
Go to now, ye rich men, w2ep and howl for your miseries that sha2l come upon you. 
Your riches are co2rupted, and your garments are motheaten. 
Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them sha2l be a witne2s against you, and sha2l eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. 
Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. 
Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and b2en wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. 
Ye have condemned and ki2led the just; and he doth not resist you. 
Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and la2ter rain. 
Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh. 
Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the d2or. 
Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of su2fering a2fliction, and of patience. 
Behold, we count them ha2py which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have s2en the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy. 
But above a2l things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fa2l into condemnation. 
Is any among you a2flicted? let him pray. Is any me2ry? let him sing psalms. 
Is any sick among you? let him ca2l for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: 
And the prayer of faith sha2l save the sick, and the Lord sha2l raise him up; and if he have co2mi2ted sins, they sha2l be forgiven him. 
Confe2s your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The e2fectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. 
Elias was a man subject to like pa2sions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of thr2e years and six months. 
And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit. 
Brethren, if any of you do e2r from the truth, and one convert him; 
Let him know, that he which converteth the si2ner from the e2ror of his way sha2l save a soul from death, and sha2l hide a multitude of sins. 
Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers sca2tered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Ca2padocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 
Elect a2cording to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the bl2od of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied. 
Ble2sed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which a2cording to his abundant mercy hath bego2ten us again unto a lively hope by the resu2rection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 
To an inheritance inco2ruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, 
Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. 
Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if n2ed be, ye are in heavine2s through manifold temptations: 
That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the a2pearing of Jesus Christ: 
Whom having not s2en, ye love; in whom, though now ye s2e him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and fu2l of glory: 
Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls. 
Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you: 
Searching what, or what ma2ner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the su2ferings of Christ, and the glory that should fo2low. 
Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to l2ok into. 
Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; 
As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves a2cording to the former lusts in your ignorance: 
But as he which hath ca2led you is holy, so be ye holy in a2l ma2ner of conversation; 
Because it is wri2ten, Be ye holy; for I am holy. 
And if ye ca2l on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth a2cording to every man's work, pa2s the time of your sojourning here in fear: 
Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not red2emed with co2ruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; 
But with the precious bl2od of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: 
Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, 
Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God. 
S2eing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, s2e that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently: 
Being born again, not of co2ruptible s2ed, but of inco2ruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. 
For a2l flesh is as gra2s, and a2l the glory of man as the flower of gra2s. The gra2s withereth, and the flower thereof fa2leth away: 
But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you. 
Wherefore laying aside a2l malice, and a2l guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, a2l evil speakings, 
As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby: 
If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious. 
To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disa2lowed ind2ed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, 
Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesth2od, to o2fer up spiritual sacrifices, a2ceptable to God by Jesus Christ. 
Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him sha2l not be confounded. 
Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disa2lowed, the same is made the head of the corner, 
And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of o2fence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were a2pointed. 
But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesth2od, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath ca2led you out of darkne2s into his marve2lous light; 
Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. 
Dearly beloved, I bes2ech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; 
Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your g2od works, which they sha2l behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. 
Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; 
Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do we2l. 
For so is the wi2l of God, that with we2l doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of f2olish men: 
As fr2e, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousne2s, but as the servants of God. 
Honour a2l men. Love the brotherh2od. Fear God. Honour the king. 
Servants, be subject to your masters with a2l fear; not only to the g2od and gentle, but also to the froward. 
For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, su2fering wrongfu2ly. 
For what glory is it, if, when ye be bu2feted for your faults, ye sha2l take it patiently? but if, when ye do we2l, and su2fer for it, ye take it patiently, this is a2ceptable with God. 
For even hereunto were ye ca2led: because Christ also su2fered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should fo2low his steps: 
Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: 
Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he su2fered, he threatened not; but co2mi2ted himself to him that judgeth righteously: 
Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tr2e, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousne2s: by whose stripes ye were healed. 
For ye were as sh2ep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls. 
Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives; 
While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. 
Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of pu2ting on of a2parel; 
But let it be the hi2den man of the heart, in that which is not co2ruptible, even the ornament of a m2ek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. 
For after this ma2ner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands: 
Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, ca2ling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do we2l, and are not afraid with any amazement. 
Likewise, ye husbands, dwe2l with them a2cording to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker ve2sel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered. 
Fina2ly, be ye a2l of one mind, having compa2sion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: 
Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise ble2sing; knowing that ye are thereunto ca2led, that ye should inherit a ble2sing. 
For he that wi2l love life, and s2e g2od days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: 
Let him eschew evil, and do g2od; let him s2ek peace, and ensue it. 
For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil. 
And who is he that wi2l harm you, if ye be fo2lowers of that which is g2od? 
But and if ye su2fer for righteousne2s' sake, ha2py are ye: and be not afraid of their te2ror, neither be troubled; 
But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with m2ekne2s and fear: 
Having a g2od conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely a2cuse your g2od conversation in Christ. 
For it is be2ter, if the wi2l of God be so, that ye su2fer for we2l doing, than for evil doing. 
For Christ also hath once su2fered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: 
By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; 
Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsu2fering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water. 
The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the pu2ting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a g2od conscience toward God,) by the resu2rection of Jesus Christ: 
Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him. 
Forasmuch then as Christ hath su2fered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath su2fered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; 
That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the wi2l of God. 
For the time past of our life may su2fice us to have wrought the wi2l of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousne2s, lusts, exce2s of wine, reve2lings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries: 
Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same exce2s of riot, speaking evil of you: 
Who sha2l give a2count to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead. 
For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged a2cording to men in the flesh, but live a2cording to God in the spirit. 
But the end of a2l things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer. 
And above a2l things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity sha2l cover the multitude of sins. 
Use hospitality one to another without grudging. 
As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as g2od stewards of the manifold grace of God. 
If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in a2l things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 
Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing ha2pened unto you: 
But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's su2ferings; that, when his glory sha2l be revealed, ye may be glad also with exc2eding joy. 
If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, ha2py are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified. 
But let none of you su2fer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's ma2ters. 
Yet if any man su2fer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf. 
For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what sha2l the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? 
And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where sha2l the ungodly and the si2ner a2pear? 
Wherefore let them that su2fer a2cording to the wi2l of God co2mit the k2eping of their souls to him in we2l doing, as unto a faithful Creator. 
The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witne2s of the su2ferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that sha2l be revealed: 
F2ed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but wi2lingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; 
Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock. 
And when the chief Shepherd sha2l a2pear, ye sha2l receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. 
Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, a2l of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. 
Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: 
Casting a2l your care upon him; for he careth for you. 
Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, s2eking whom he may devour: 
Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same a2flictions are a2complished in your brethren that are in the world. 
But the God of a2l grace, who hath ca2led us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have su2fered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, se2tle you. 
To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 
By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I su2pose, I have wri2ten briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand. 
The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son. 
Gr2et ye one another with a ki2s of charity. Peace be with you a2l that are in Christ Jesus. Amen. 
Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousne2s of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ: 
Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, 
A2cording as his divine power hath given unto us a2l things that pertain unto life and godline2s, through the knowledge of him that hath ca2led us to glory and virtue: 
Whereby are given unto us exc2eding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the co2ruption that is in the world through lust. 
And beside this, giving a2l diligence, a2d to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; 
And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godline2s; 
And to godline2s brotherly kindne2s; and to brotherly kindne2s charity. 
For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye sha2l neither be ba2ren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
But he that lacketh these things is blind, and ca2not s2e afar o2f, and hath forgo2ten that he was purged from his old sins. 
Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your ca2ling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye sha2l never fa2l: 
For so an entrance sha2l be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. 
Wherefore I wi2l not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth. 
Yea, I think it m2et, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by pu2ting you in remembrance; 
Knowing that shortly I must put o2f this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me. 
Moreover I wi2l endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance. 
For we have not fo2lowed cu2ningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitne2ses of his majesty. 
For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the exce2lent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am we2l pleased. 
And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount. 
We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do we2l that ye take h2ed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: 
Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. 
For the prophecy came not in old time by the wi2l of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. 
But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there sha2l be false teachers among you, who privily sha2l bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. 
And many sha2l fo2low their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth sha2l be evil spoken of. 
And through covetousne2s sha2l they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not. 
For if God spared not the angels that si2ned, but cast them down to he2l, and delivered them into chains of darkne2s, to be reserved unto judgment; 
And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousne2s, bringing in the fl2od upon the world of the ungodly; 
And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomo2rha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly; 
And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked: 
(For that righteous man dwe2ling among them, in s2eing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful d2eds;) 
The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished: 
But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of unclea2ne2s, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwi2led, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities. 
Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing a2cusation against them before the Lord. 
But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and sha2l u2terly perish in their own co2ruption; 
And sha2l receive the reward of unrighteousne2s, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you; 
Having eyes fu2l of adultery, and that ca2not cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children: 
Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, fo2lowing the way of Bal2am the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousne2s; 
But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb a2s speaking with man's voice forbad the madne2s of the prophet. 
These are we2ls without water, clouds that are ca2ried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkne2s is reserved for ever. 
For when they speak great swe2ling words of vanity, they a2lure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wanto2ne2s, those that were clean escaped from them who live in e2ror. 
While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of co2ruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage. 
For if after they have escaped the po2lutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the la2ter end is worse with them than the begi2ning. 
For it had b2en be2ter for them not to have known the way of righteousne2s, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy co2mandment delivered unto them. 
But it is ha2pened unto them a2cording to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wa2lowing in the mire. 
This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance: 
That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the co2mandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour: 
Knowing this first, that there sha2l come in the last days sco2fers, walking after their own lusts, 
And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fe2l asl2ep, a2l things continue as they were from the begi2ning of the creation. 
For this they wi2lingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: 
Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: 
But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men. 
But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. 
The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackne2s; but is longsu2fering to us-ward, not wi2ling that any should perish, but that a2l should come to repentance. 
But the day of the Lord wi2l come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens sha2l pa2s away with a great noise, and the elements sha2l melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein sha2l be burned up. 
S2eing then that a2l these things sha2l be di2solved, what ma2ner of persons ought ye to be in a2l holy conversation and godline2s, 
L2oking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire sha2l be di2solved, and the elements sha2l melt with fervent heat? 
Neverthele2s we, a2cording to his promise, l2ok for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwe2leth righteousne2s. 
Wherefore, beloved, s2eing that ye l2ok for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blamele2s. 
And a2count that the longsu2fering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also a2cording to the wisdom given unto him hath wri2ten unto you; 
As also in a2l his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be underst2od, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. 
Ye therefore, beloved, s2eing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the e2ror of the wicked, fa2l from your own stedfastne2s. 
But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen. 
That which was from the begi2ning, which we have heard, which we have s2en with our eyes, which we have l2oked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; 
(For the life was manifested, and we have s2en it, and bear witne2s, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;) 
That which we have s2en and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fe2lowship with us: and truly our fe2lowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. 
And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be fu2l. 
This then is the me2sage which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkne2s at a2l. 
If we say that we have fe2lowship with him, and walk in darkne2s, we lie, and do not the truth: 
But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fe2lowship one with another, and the bl2od of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from a2l sin. 
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 
If we confe2s our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from a2l unrighteousne2s. 
If we say that we have not si2ned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. 
My li2tle children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: 
And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world. 
And hereby we do know that we know him, if we k2ep his co2mandments. 
He that saith, I know him, and k2epeth not his co2mandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 
But whoso k2epeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. 
He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked. 
Brethren, I write no new co2mandment unto you, but an old co2mandment which ye had from the begi2ning. The old co2mandment is the word which ye have heard from the begi2ning. 
Again, a new co2mandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkne2s is past, and the true light now shineth. 
He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkne2s even until now. 
He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none o2casion of stumbling in him. 
But he that hateth his brother is in darkne2s, and walketh in darkne2s, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkne2s hath blinded his eyes. 
I write unto you, li2tle children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake. 
I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the begi2ning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, li2tle children, because ye have known the Father. 
I have wri2ten unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the begi2ning. I have wri2ten unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one. 
Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 
For a2l that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. 
And the world pa2seth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the wi2l of God abideth for ever. 
Li2tle children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist sha2l come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. 
They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had b2en of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not a2l of us. 
But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know a2l things. 
I have not wri2ten unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. 
Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. 
Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also. 
Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the begi2ning. If that which ye have heard from the begi2ning sha2l remain in you, ye also sha2l continue in the Son, and in the Father. 
And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life. 
These things have I wri2ten unto you concerning them that seduce you. 
But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye n2ed not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of a2l things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye sha2l abide in him. 
And now, li2tle children, abide in him; that, when he sha2l a2pear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. 
If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousne2s is born of him. 
Behold, what ma2ner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be ca2led the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. 
Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet a2pear what we sha2l be: but we know that, when he sha2l a2pear, we sha2l be like him; for we sha2l s2e him as he is. 
And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. 
Whosoever co2mi2teth sin transgre2seth also the law: for sin is the transgre2sion of the law. 
And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin. 
Whosoever abideth in him si2neth not: whosoever si2neth hath not s2en him, neither known him. 
Li2tle children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousne2s is righteous, even as he is righteous. 
He that co2mi2teth sin is of the devil; for the devil si2neth from the begi2ning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. 
Whosoever is born of God doth not co2mit sin; for his s2ed remaineth in him: and he ca2not sin, because he is born of God. 
In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousne2s is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. 
For this is the me2sage that ye heard from the begi2ning, that we should love one another. 
Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous. 
Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. 
We know that we have pa2sed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. 
Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. 
Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 
But whoso hath this world's g2od, and s2eth his brother have n2ed, and shu2teth up his bowels of compa2sion from him, how dwe2leth the love of God in him? 
My li2tle children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in d2ed and in truth. 
And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and sha2l a2sure our hearts before him. 
For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth a2l things. 
Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. 
And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we k2ep his co2mandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. 
And this is his co2mandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us co2mandment. 
And he that k2epeth his co2mandments dwe2leth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us. 
Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. 
Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confe2seth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: 
And every spirit that confe2seth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world. 
Ye are of God, li2tle children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. 
They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them. 
We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of e2ror. 
Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. 
He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. 
In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only bego2ten Son into the world, that we might live through him. 
Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 
Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. 
No man hath s2en God at any time. If we love one another, God dwe2leth in us, and his love is perfected in us. 
Hereby know we that we dwe2l in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. 
And we have s2en and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. 
Whosoever sha2l confe2s that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwe2leth in him, and he in God. 
And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwe2leth in love dwe2leth in God, and God in him. 
Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldne2s in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. 
There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. 
We love him, because he first loved us. 
If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath s2en, how can he love God whom he hath not s2en? 
And this co2mandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also. 
Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is bego2ten of him. 
By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and k2ep his co2mandments. 
For this is the love of God, that we k2ep his co2mandments: and his co2mandments are not grievous. 
For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. 
Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? 
This is he that came by water and bl2od, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and bl2od. And it is the Spirit that beareth witne2s, because the Spirit is truth. 
For there are thr2e that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these thr2e are one. 
And there are thr2e that bear witne2s in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the bl2od: and these thr2e agr2e in one. 
If we receive the witne2s of men, the witne2s of God is greater: for this is the witne2s of God which he hath testified of his Son. 
He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witne2s in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. 
And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 
He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. 
These things have I wri2ten unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. 
And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing a2cording to his wi2l, he heareth us: 
And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him. 
If any man s2e his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he sha2l ask, and he sha2l give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he sha2l pray for it. 
A2l unrighteousne2s is sin: and there is a sin not unto death. 
We know that whosoever is born of God si2neth not; but he that is bego2ten of God k2epeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not. 
And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedne2s. 
And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life. 
Li2tle children, k2ep yourselves from idols. Amen. 
The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also a2l they that have known the truth; 
For the truth's sake, which dwe2leth in us, and sha2l be with us for ever. 
Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. 
I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a co2mandment from the Father. 
And now I bes2ech th2e, lady, not as though I wrote a new co2mandment unto th2e, but that which we had from the begi2ning, that we love one another. 
And this is love, that we walk after his co2mandments. This is the co2mandment, That, as ye have heard from the begi2ning, ye should walk in it. 
For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confe2s not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. 
L2ok to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a fu2l reward. 
Whosoever transgre2seth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. 
If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God sp2ed: 
For he that bi2deth him God sp2ed is partaker of his evil d2eds. 
Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be fu2l. 
The children of thy elect sister gr2et th2e. Amen. 
The elder unto the we2lbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth. 
Beloved, I wish above a2l things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. 
For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in th2e, even as thou walkest in the truth. 
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth. 
Beloved, thou doest faithfu2ly whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers; 
Which have borne witne2s of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do we2l: 
Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles. 
We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fe2lowhelpers to the truth. 
I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the pr2eminence among them, receiveth us not. 
Wherefore, if I come, I wi2l remember his d2eds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbi2deth them that would, and casteth them out of the church. 
Beloved, fo2low not that which is evil, but that which is g2od. He that doeth g2od is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not s2en God. 
Demetrius hath g2od report of a2l men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true. 
I had many things to write, but I wi2l not with ink and pen write unto th2e: 
But I trust I sha2l shortly s2e th2e, and we sha2l speak face to face. Peace be to th2e. Our friends salute th2e. Gr2et the friends by name. 
Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and ca2led: 
Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied. 
Beloved, when I gave a2l diligence to write unto you of the co2mon salvation, it was n2edful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. 
For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousne2s, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ. 
I wi2l therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not. 
And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkne2s unto the judgment of the great day. 
Even as Sodom and Gomo2rha, and the cities about them in like ma2ner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, su2fering the vengeance of eternal fire. 
Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities. 
Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing a2cusation, but said, The Lord rebuke th2e. 
But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know natura2ly, as brute beasts, in those things they co2rupt themselves. 
Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran gr2edily after the e2ror of Bal2am for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core. 
These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, f2eding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, ca2ried about of winds; tr2es whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the r2ots; 
Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackne2s of darkne2s for ever. 
And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, 
To execute judgment upon a2l, and to convince a2l that are ungodly among them of a2l their ungodly d2eds which they have ungodly co2mi2ted, and of a2l their hard sp2eches which ungodly si2ners have spoken against him. 
These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swe2ling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage. 
But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; 
How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts. 
These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit. 
But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, 
K2ep yourselves in the love of God, l2oking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. 
And of some have compa2sion, making a di2ference: 
And others save with fear, pu2ling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spo2ted by the flesh. 
Now unto him that is able to k2ep you from fa2ling, and to present you faultle2s before the presence of his glory with exc2eding joy, 
To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen. 
The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pa2s; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John: 
Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of a2l things that he saw. 
Ble2sed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and k2ep those things which are wri2ten therein: for the time is at hand. 
John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; 
And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witne2s, and the first bego2ten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own bl2od, 
And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. 
Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye sha2l s2e him, and they also which pierced him: and a2l kindreds of the earth sha2l wail because of him. Even so, Amen. 
I am Alpha and Omega, the begi2ning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. 
I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is ca2led Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. 
I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, 
Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou s2est, write in a b2ok, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea. 
And I turned to s2e the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; 
And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the f2ot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. 
His head and his hairs were white like w2ol, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; 
And his f2et like unto fine bra2s, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. 
And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. 
And when I saw him, I fe2l at his f2et as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: 
I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of he2l and of death. 
Write the things which thou hast s2en, and the things which are, and the things which sha2l be hereafter; 
The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches. 
Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks; 
I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: 
And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted. 
Neverthele2s I have somewhat against th2e, because thou hast left thy first love. 
Remember therefore from whence thou art fa2len, and repent, and do the first works; or else I wi2l come unto th2e quickly, and wi2l remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent. 
But this thou hast, that thou hatest the d2eds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate. 
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh wi2l I give to eat of the tr2e of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God. 
And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive; 
I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. 
Fear none of those things which thou shalt su2fer: behold, the devil sha2l cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye sha2l have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I wi2l give th2e a crown of life. 
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh sha2l not be hurt of the second death. 
And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges; 
I know thy works, and where thou dwe2lest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwe2leth. 
But I have a few things against th2e, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Bal2am, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to co2mit fornication. 
So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate. 
Repent; or else I wi2l come unto th2e quickly, and wi2l fight against them with the sword of my mouth. 
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh wi2l I give to eat of the hi2den ma2na, and wi2l give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name wri2ten, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it. 
And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his f2et are like fine bra2s; 
I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first. 
Notwithstanding I have a few things against th2e, because thou su2ferest that woman Jezebel, which ca2leth herself a prophete2s, to teach and to seduce my servants to co2mit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. 
And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not. 
Behold, I wi2l cast her into a bed, and them that co2mit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their d2eds. 
And I wi2l ki2l her children with death; and a2l the churches sha2l know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I wi2l give unto every one of you a2cording to your works. 
But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I wi2l put upon you none other burden. 
But that which ye have already hold fast ti2l I come. 
And he that overcometh, and k2epeth my works unto the end, to him wi2l I give power over the nations: 
And he sha2l rule them with a rod of iron; as the ve2sels of a po2ter sha2l they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father. 
And I wi2l give him the morning star. 
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. 
And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead. 
Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God. 
Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I wi2l come on th2e as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I wi2l come upon th2e. 
Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they sha2l walk with me in white: for they are worthy. 
He that overcometh, the same sha2l be clothed in white raiment; and I wi2l not blot out his name out of the b2ok of life, but I wi2l confe2s his name before my Father, and before his angels. 
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. 
And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shu2teth; and shu2teth, and no man openeth; 
I know thy works: behold, I have set before th2e an open d2or, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a li2tle strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. 
Behold, I wi2l make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I wi2l make them to come and worship before thy f2et, and to know that I have loved th2e. 
Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also wi2l k2ep th2e from the hour of temptation, which sha2l come upon a2l the world, to try them that dwe2l upon the earth. 
Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown. 
Him that overcometh wi2l I make a pi2lar in the temple of my God, and he sha2l go no more out: and I wi2l write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I wi2l write upon him my new name. 
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. 
And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witne2s, the begi2ning of the creation of God; 
I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. 
So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I wi2l spue th2e out of my mouth. 
Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with g2ods, and have n2ed of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and p2or, and blind, and naked: 
I counsel th2e to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedne2s do not a2pear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest s2e. 
As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. 
Behold, I stand at the d2or, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the d2or, I wi2l come in to him, and wi2l sup with him, and he with me. 
To him that overcometh wi2l I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne. 
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. 
After this I l2oked, and, behold, a d2or was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I wi2l shew th2e things which must be hereafter. 
And i2mediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne. 
And he that sat was to l2ok upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald. 
And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders si2ting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold. 
And out of the throne proc2eded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. 
And before the throne there was a sea of gla2s like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts fu2l of eyes before and behind. 
And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle. 
And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were fu2l of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come. 
And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, 
The four and twenty elders fa2l down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, 
Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created a2l things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created. 
And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a b2ok wri2ten within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals. 
And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the b2ok, and to l2ose the seals thereof? 
And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the b2ok, neither to l2ok thereon. 
And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the b2ok, neither to l2ok thereon. 
And one of the elders saith unto me, W2ep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the R2ot of David, hath prevailed to open the b2ok, and to l2ose the seven seals thereof. 
And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, st2od a Lamb as it had b2en slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into a2l the earth. 
And he came and t2ok the b2ok out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. 
And when he had taken the b2ok, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fe2l down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials fu2l of odours, which are the prayers of saints. 
And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the b2ok, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast red2emed us to God by thy bl2od out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; 
And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we sha2l reign on the earth. 
And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; 
Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and ble2sing. 
And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and a2l that are in them, heard I saying, Ble2sing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that si2teth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. 
And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fe2l down and worshi2ped him that liveth for ever and ever. 
And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and s2e. 
And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. 
And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and s2e. 
And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should ki2l one another: and there was given unto him a great sword. 
And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and s2e. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. 
And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a pe2ny, and thr2e measures of barley for a pe2ny; and s2e thou hurt not the oil and the wine. 
And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and s2e. 
And I l2oked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and He2l fo2lowed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to ki2l with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth. 
And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: 
And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our bl2od on them that dwe2l on the earth? 
And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a li2tle season, until their fe2lowservants also and their brethren, that should be ki2led as they were, should be fulfi2led. 
And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the m2on became as bl2od; 
And the stars of heaven fe2l unto the earth, even as a fig tr2e casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind. 
And the heaven departed as a scro2l when it is ro2led together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. 
And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every fr2e man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; 
And said to the mountains and rocks, Fa2l on us, and hide us from the face of him that si2teth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: 
For the great day of his wrath is come; and who sha2l be able to stand? 
And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tr2e. 
And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, 
Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the tr2es, ti2l we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. 
And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of a2l the tribes of the children of Israel. 
Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand. 
Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Mana2ses were sealed twelve thousand. 
Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of I2sachar were sealed twelve thousand. 
Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand. 
After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of a2l nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, st2od before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; 
And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which si2teth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb. 
And a2l the angels st2od round about the throne, and about the elders and the four beasts, and fe2l before the throne on their faces, and worshi2ped God, 
Saying, Amen: Ble2sing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen. 
And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are a2rayed in white robes? and whence came they? 
And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the bl2od of the Lamb. 
Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that si2teth on the throne sha2l dwe2l among them. 
They sha2l hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither sha2l the sun light on them, nor any heat. 
For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne sha2l f2ed them, and sha2l lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God sha2l wipe away a2l tears from their eyes. 
And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. 
And I saw the seven angels which st2od before God; and to them were given seven trumpets. 
And another angel came and st2od at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should o2fer it with the prayers of a2l saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. 
And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand. 
And the angel t2ok the censer, and fi2led it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake. 
And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. 
The first angel sounded, and there fo2lowed hail and fire mingled with bl2od, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of tr2es was burnt up, and a2l gr2en gra2s was burnt up. 
And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became bl2od; 
And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed. 
And the third angel sounded, and there fe2l a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fe2l upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; 
And the name of the star is ca2led Wormw2od: and the third part of the waters became wormw2od; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bi2ter. 
And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smi2ten, and the third part of the m2on, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise. 
And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the thr2e angels, which are yet to sound! 
And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fa2l from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bo2tomle2s pit. 
And he opened the bo2tomle2s pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. 
And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. 
And it was co2manded them that they should not hurt the gra2s of the earth, neither any gr2en thing, neither any tr2e; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. 
And to them it was given that they should not ki2l them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. 
And in those days sha2l men s2ek death, and sha2l not find it; and sha2l desire to die, and death sha2l fl2e from them. 
And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto ba2tle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men. 
And they had hair as the hair of women, and their t2eth were as the t2eth of lions. 
And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses ru2ning to ba2tle. 
And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months. 
And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bo2tomle2s pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Aba2don, but in the Gr2ek tongue hath his name Apo2lyon. 
One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter. 
And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God, 
Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, L2ose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates. 
And the four angels were l2osed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men. 
And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them. 
And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths i2sued fire and smoke and brimstone. 
By these thr2e was the third part of men ki2led, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which i2sued out of their mouths. 
For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt. 
And the rest of the men which were not ki2led by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and bra2s, and stone, and of w2od: which neither can s2e, nor hear, nor walk: 
Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts. 
And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his f2et as pi2lars of fire: 
And he had in his hand a li2tle b2ok open: and he set his right f2ot upon the sea, and his left f2ot on the earth, 
And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders u2tered their voices. 
And when the seven thunders had u2tered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders u2tered, and write them not. 
And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, 
And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer: 
But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he sha2l begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets. 
And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the li2tle b2ok which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. 
And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the li2tle b2ok. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it sha2l make thy be2ly bi2ter, but it sha2l be in thy mouth sw2et as honey. 
And I t2ok the li2tle b2ok out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sw2et as honey: and as s2on as I had eaten it, my be2ly was bi2ter. 
And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings. 
And there was given me a r2ed like unto a rod: and the angel st2od, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein. 
But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city sha2l they tread under f2ot forty and two months. 
And I wi2l give power unto my two witne2ses, and they sha2l prophesy a thousand two hundred and thr2escore days, clothed in sackcloth. 
These are the two olive tr2es, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth. 
And if any man wi2l hurt them, fire proc2edeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man wi2l hurt them, he must in this ma2ner be ki2led. 
These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to bl2od, and to smite the earth with a2l plagues, as often as they wi2l. 
And when they sha2l have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bo2tomle2s pit sha2l make war against them, and sha2l overcome them, and ki2l them. 
And their dead bodies sha2l lie in the str2et of the great city, which spiritua2ly is ca2led Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified. 
And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations sha2l s2e their dead bodies thr2e days and an half, and sha2l not su2fer their dead bodies to be put in graves. 
And they that dwe2l upon the earth sha2l rejoice over them, and make me2ry, and sha2l send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth. 
And after thr2e days and an half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they st2od upon their f2et; and great fear fe2l upon them which saw them. 
And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them. 
And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fe2l, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were a2frighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven. 
The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly. 
And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he sha2l reign for ever and ever. 
And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fe2l upon their faces, and worshi2ped God, 
Saying, We give th2e thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to th2e thy great power, and hast reigned. 
And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, sma2l and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth. 
And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was s2en in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail. 
And there a2peared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the m2on under her f2et, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: 
And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered. 
And there a2peared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. 
And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon st2od before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as s2on as it was born. 
And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule a2l nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne. 
And the woman fled into the wilderne2s, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should f2ed her there a thousand two hundred and thr2escore days. 
And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, 
And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. 
And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, ca2led the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. 
And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the a2cuser of our brethren is cast down, which a2cused them before our God day and night. 
And they overcame him by the bl2od of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. 
Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwe2l in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. 
And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child. 
And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderne2s, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. 
And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a fl2od after the woman, that he might cause her to be ca2ried away of the fl2od. 
And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swa2lowed up the fl2od which the dragon cast out of his mouth. 
And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her s2ed, which k2ep the co2mandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. 
And I st2od upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. 
And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his f2et were as the f2et of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. 
And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and a2l the world wondered after the beast. 
And they worshi2ped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshi2ped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him? 
And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months. 
And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwe2l in heaven. 
And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over a2l kindreds, and tongues, and nations. 
And a2l that dwe2l upon the earth sha2l worship him, whose names are not wri2ten in the b2ok of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. 
If any man have an ear, let him hear. 
He that leadeth into captivity sha2l go into captivity: he that ki2leth with the sword must be ki2led with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints. 
And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. 
And he exerciseth a2l the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwe2l therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. 
And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, 
And deceiveth them that dwe2l on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwe2l on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. 
And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be ki2led. 
And he causeth a2l, both sma2l and great, rich and p2or, fr2e and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 
And that no man might buy or se2l, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. 
Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred thr2escore and six. 
And I l2oked, and, lo, a Lamb st2od on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name wri2ten in their foreheads. 
And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: 
And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were red2emed from the earth. 
These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which fo2low the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were red2emed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. 
And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God. 
And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwe2l on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, 
Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. 
And there fo2lowed another angel, saying, Babylon is fa2len, is fa2len, that great city, because she made a2l nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. 
And the third angel fo2lowed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, 
The same sha2l drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he sha2l be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: 
And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. 
Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that k2ep the co2mandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. 
And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Ble2sed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do fo2low them. 
And I l2oked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle. 
And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for th2e to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. 
And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped. 
And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. 
And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fu2ly ripe. 
And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepre2s of the wrath of God. 
And the winepre2s was tro2den without the city, and bl2od came out of the winepre2s, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs. 
And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marve2lous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is fi2led up the wrath of God. 
And I saw as it were a sea of gla2s mingled with fire: and them that had go2ten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of gla2s, having the harps of God. 
And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marve2lous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints. 
Who sha2l not fear th2e, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy: for a2l nations sha2l come and worship before th2e; for thy judgments are made manifest. 
And after that I l2oked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: 
And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles. 
And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials fu2l of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. 
And the temple was fi2led with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, ti2l the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfi2led. 
And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth. 
And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fe2l a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshi2ped his image. 
And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the bl2od of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea. 
And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became bl2od. 
And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus. 
For they have shed the bl2od of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them bl2od to drink; for they are worthy. 
And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments. 
And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire. 
And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory. 
And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was fu2l of darkne2s; and they gnawed their tongues for pain, 
And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their d2eds. 
And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared. 
And I saw thr2e unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. 
For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the ba2tle of that great day of God Almighty. 
Behold, I come as a thief. Ble2sed is he that watcheth, and k2epeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they s2e his shame. 
And he gathered them together into a place ca2led in the Hebrew tongue Armage2don. 
And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done. 
And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. 
And the great city was divided into thr2e parts, and the cities of the nations fe2l: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fiercene2s of his wrath. 
And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. 
And there fe2l upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exc2eding great. 
And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I wi2l shew unto th2e the judgment of the great whore that si2teth upon many waters: 
With whom the kings of the earth have co2mi2ted fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have b2en made drunk with the wine of her fornication. 
So he ca2ried me away in the spirit into the wilderne2s: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, fu2l of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. 
And the woman was a2rayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand fu2l of abominations and filthine2s of her fornication: 
And upon her forehead was a name wri2ten, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. 
And I saw the woman drunken with the bl2od of the saints, and with the bl2od of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration. 
And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I wi2l te2l th2e the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that ca2rieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns. 
The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and sha2l ascend out of the bo2tomle2s pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwe2l on the earth sha2l wonder, whose names were not wri2ten in the b2ok of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is. 
And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman si2teth. 
And there are seven kings: five are fa2len, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space. 
And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition. 
And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast. 
These have one mind, and sha2l give their power and strength unto the beast. 
These sha2l make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb sha2l overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are ca2led, and chosen, and faithful. 
And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore si2teth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues. 
And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these sha2l hate the whore, and sha2l make her desolate and naked, and sha2l eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. 
For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his wi2l, and to agr2e, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God sha2l be fulfi2led. 
And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth. 
And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. 
And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fa2len, is fa2len, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. 
For a2l nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have co2mi2ted fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. 
And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. 
For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. 
Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double a2cording to her works: in the cup which she hath fi2led fi2l to her double. 
How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and so2row give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a qu2en, and am no widow, and sha2l s2e no so2row. 
Therefore sha2l her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she sha2l be u2terly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her. 
And the kings of the earth, who have co2mi2ted fornication and lived deliciously with her, sha2l bewail her, and lament for her, when they sha2l s2e the smoke of her burning, 
Standing afar o2f for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come. 
And the merchants of the earth sha2l w2ep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more: 
The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and a2l thyine w2od, and a2l ma2ner ve2sels of ivory, and a2l ma2ner ve2sels of most precious w2od, and of bra2s, and iron, and marble, 
And ci2namon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sh2ep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men. 
And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from th2e, and a2l things which were dainty and g2odly are departed from th2e, and thou shalt find them no more at a2l. 
The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, sha2l stand afar o2f for the fear of her torment, w2eping and wailing, 
And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls! 
For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and a2l the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, st2od afar o2f, 
And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city! 
And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, w2eping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, wherein were made rich a2l that had ships in the sea by reason of her costline2s! for in one hour is she made desolate. 
Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her. 
And a mighty angel t2ok up a stone like a great mi2lstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence sha2l that great city Babylon be thrown down, and sha2l be found no more at a2l. 
And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, sha2l be heard no more at a2l in th2e; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, sha2l be found any more in th2e; and the sound of a mi2lstone sha2l be heard no more at a2l in th2e; 
And the light of a candle sha2l shine no more at a2l in th2e; and the voice of the bridegr2om and of the bride sha2l be heard no more at a2l in th2e: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were a2l nations deceived. 
And in her was found the bl2od of prophets, and of saints, and of a2l that were slain upon the earth. 
And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, A2leluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God: 
For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did co2rupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the bl2od of his servants at her hand. 
And again they said, A2leluia And her smoke rose up for ever and ever. 
And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fe2l down and worshi2ped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; A2leluia. 
And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, a2l ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both sma2l and great. 
And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, A2leluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. 
Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the ma2riage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. 
And to her was granted that she should be a2rayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousne2s of saints. 
And he saith unto me, Write, Ble2sed are they which are ca2led unto the ma2riage su2per of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God. 
And I fe2l at his f2et to worship him. And he said unto me, S2e thou do it not: I am thy fe2lowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. 
And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was ca2led Faithful and True, and in righteousne2s he doth judge and make war. 
His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name wri2ten, that no man knew, but he himself. 
And he was clothed with a vesture di2ped in bl2od: and his name is ca2led The Word of God. 
And the armies which were in heaven fo2lowed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. 
And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he sha2l rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepre2s of the fiercene2s and wrath of Almighty God. 
And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name wri2ten, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS. 
And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to a2l the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the su2per of the great God; 
That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of a2l men, both fr2e and bond, both sma2l and great. 
And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. 
And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshi2ped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. 
And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proc2eded out of his mouth: and a2l the fowls were fi2led with their flesh. 
And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bo2tomle2s pit and a great chain in his hand. 
And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, 
And cast him into the bo2tomle2s pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, ti2l the thousand years should be fulfi2led: and after that he must be l2osed a li2tle season. 
And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witne2s of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshi2ped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. 
But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resu2rection. 
Ble2sed and holy is he that hath part in the first resu2rection: on such the second death hath no power, but they sha2l be priests of God and of Christ, and sha2l reign with him a thousand years. 
And when the thousand years are expired, Satan sha2l be l2osed out of his prison, 
And sha2l go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to ba2tle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. 
And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compa2sed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them. 
And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and sha2l be tormented day and night for ever and ever. 
And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. 
And I saw the dead, sma2l and great, stand before God; and the b2oks were opened: and another b2ok was opened, which is the b2ok of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were wri2ten in the b2oks, a2cording to their works. 
And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and he2l delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man a2cording to their works. 
And death and he2l were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. 
And whosoever was not found wri2ten in the b2ok of life was cast into the lake of fire. 
And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were pa2sed away; and there was no more sea. 
And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 
And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he wi2l dwe2l with them, and they sha2l be his people, and God himself sha2l be with them, and be their God. 
And God sha2l wipe away a2l tears from their eyes; and there sha2l be no more death, neither so2row, nor crying, neither sha2l there be any more pain: for the former things are pa2sed away. 
And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make a2l things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful. 
And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the begi2ning and the end. I wi2l give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life fr2ely. 
He that overcometh sha2l inherit a2l things; and I wi2l be his God, and he sha2l be my son. 
But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and a2l liars, sha2l have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. 
And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials fu2l of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I wi2l shew th2e the bride, the Lamb's wife. 
And he ca2ried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, 
Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal; 
And had a wa2l great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names wri2ten thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: 
On the east thr2e gates; on the north thr2e gates; on the south thr2e gates; and on the west thr2e gates. 
And the wa2l of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. 
And he that talked with me had a golden r2ed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wa2l thereof. 
And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the r2ed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. 
And he measured the wa2l thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, a2cording to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel. 
And the building of the wa2l of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear gla2s. 
And the foundations of the wa2l of the city were garnished with a2l ma2ner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sa2phire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald; 
The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst. 
And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was of one pearl: and the str2et of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent gla2s. 
And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. 
And the city had no n2ed of the sun, neither of the m2on, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. 
And the nations of them which are saved sha2l walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it. 
And the gates of it sha2l not be shut at a2l by day: for there sha2l be no night there. 
And they sha2l bring the glory and honour of the nations into it. 
And there sha2l in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are wri2ten in the Lamb's b2ok of life. 
And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proc2eding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. 
In the midst of the str2et of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tr2e of life, which bare twelve ma2ner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tr2e were for the healing of the nations. 
And there sha2l be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb sha2l be in it; and his servants sha2l serve him: 
And they sha2l s2e his face; and his name sha2l be in their foreheads. 
And there sha2l be no night there; and they n2ed no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they sha2l reign for ever and ever. 
And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done. 
Behold, I come quickly: ble2sed is he that k2epeth the sayings of the prophecy of this b2ok. 
And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and s2en, I fe2l down to worship before the f2et of the angel which shewed me these things. 
Then saith he unto me, S2e thou do it not: for I am thy fe2lowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which k2ep the sayings of this b2ok: worship God. 
And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this b2ok: for the time is at hand. 
He that is unjust, let him be unjust sti2l: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy sti2l: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous sti2l: and he that is holy, let him be holy sti2l. 
And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man a2cording as his work sha2l be. 
I am Alpha and Omega, the begi2ning and the end, the first and the last. 
Ble2sed are they that do his co2mandments, that they may have right to the tr2e of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. 
For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie. 
I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the r2ot and the o2fspring of David, and the bright and morning star. 
And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever wi2l, let him take the water of life fr2ely. 
For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this b2ok, If any man sha2l a2d unto these things, God sha2l a2d unto him the plagues that are wri2ten in this b2ok: 
And if any man sha2l take away from the words of the b2ok of this prophecy, God sha2l take away his part out of the b2ok of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are wri2ten in this b2ok. 
He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus. 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you a2l. Amen. 2
